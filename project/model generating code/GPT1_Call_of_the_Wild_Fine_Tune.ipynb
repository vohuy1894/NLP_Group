Into the Primitive\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOld longings nomadic leap,\\\\r\\\\nChafing at custom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chain;\\\\r\\\\nAgain from its brumal sleep\\\\r\\\\nWakens the ferine strain.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble\\\\r\\\\nwas brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog,\\\\r\\\\nstrong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San\\\\r\\\\nDiego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow\\\\r\\\\nmetal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming\\\\r\\\\nthe find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men\\\\r\\\\nwanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong\\\\r\\\\nmuscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the\\\\r\\\\nfrost.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge\\\\r\\\\nMiller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden\\\\r\\\\namong the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide\\\\r\\\\ncool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached\\\\r\\\\nby gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns\\\\r\\\\nand under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things\\\\r\\\\nwere on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great\\\\r\\\\nstables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad\\\\r\\\\nservants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long\\\\r\\\\ngrape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there\\\\r\\\\nwas the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank\\\\r\\\\nwhere Judge Miller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in\\\\r\\\\nthe hot afternoon.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he\\\\r\\\\nhad lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other\\\\r\\\\ndogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they\\\\r\\\\ndid not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or\\\\r\\\\nlived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of\\\\r\\\\nToots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94strange\\\\r\\\\ncreatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On\\\\r\\\\nthe other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least,\\\\r\\\\nwho yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the\\\\r\\\\nwindows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with\\\\r\\\\nbrooms and mops.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.\\\\r\\\\nHe plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nsons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s daughters, on long\\\\r\\\\ntwilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the\\\\r\\\\nJudge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ngrandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their\\\\r\\\\nfootsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable\\\\r\\\\nyard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.\\\\r\\\\nAmong the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he\\\\r\\\\nutterly ignored, for he was king,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94king over all creeping, crawling,\\\\r\\\\nflying things of Judge Miller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s place, humans included.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inseparable\\\\r\\\\ncompanion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was\\\\r\\\\nnot so large,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for his\\\\r\\\\nmother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred\\\\r\\\\nand forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good\\\\r\\\\nliving and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right\\\\r\\\\nroyal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived\\\\r\\\\nthe life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was\\\\r\\\\neven a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become\\\\r\\\\nbecause of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not\\\\r\\\\nbecoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor\\\\r\\\\ndelights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as\\\\r\\\\nto the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a\\\\r\\\\nhealth preserver.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the\\\\r\\\\nKlondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.\\\\r\\\\nBut Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel,\\\\r\\\\none of the gardener\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel\\\\r\\\\nhad one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his\\\\r\\\\ngambling, he had one besetting weakness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94faith in a system; and this\\\\r\\\\nmade his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while\\\\r\\\\nthe wages of a gardener\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife\\\\r\\\\nand numerous progeny.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Association, and the\\\\r\\\\nboys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of\\\\r\\\\nManuel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard\\\\r\\\\non what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a\\\\r\\\\nsolitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known\\\\r\\\\nas College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between\\\\r\\\\nthem.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou might wrap up the goods before you deliver \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the stranger said\\\\r\\\\ngruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck\\\\r\\\\nunder the collar.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTwist it, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll choke \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m plentee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Manuel, and the stranger\\\\r\\\\ngrunted a ready affirmative.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an\\\\r\\\\nunwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and\\\\r\\\\nto give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the\\\\r\\\\nends of the rope were placed in the stranger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hands, he growled\\\\r\\\\nmenacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride\\\\r\\\\nbelieving that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope\\\\r\\\\ntightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he\\\\r\\\\nsprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the\\\\r\\\\nthroat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope\\\\r\\\\ntightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue\\\\r\\\\nlolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in\\\\r\\\\nall his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life\\\\r\\\\nhad he been so angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he\\\\r\\\\nknew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into\\\\r\\\\nthe baggage car.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and\\\\r\\\\nthat he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse\\\\r\\\\nshriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He\\\\r\\\\nhad travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of\\\\r\\\\nriding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the\\\\r\\\\nunbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but\\\\r\\\\nBuck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they\\\\r\\\\nrelax till his senses were choked out of him once more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYep, has fits,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the\\\\r\\\\nbaggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\r\\\\ntakin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up for the boss to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks\\\\r\\\\nthat he can cure \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nConcerning that night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for\\\\r\\\\nhimself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water\\\\r\\\\nfront.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll I get is fifty for it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he grumbled; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it over\\\\r\\\\nfor a thousand, cold cash.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser\\\\r\\\\nleg was ripped from knee to ankle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow much did the other mug get?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the saloon-keeper demanded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA hundred,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was the reply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take a sou less, so help me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat makes a hundred and fifty,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the saloon-keeper calculated; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand\\\\r\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth it, or I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a squarehead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated\\\\r\\\\nhand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get the hydrophoby\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be because you was born to hang,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d laughed the saloon-keeper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life\\\\r\\\\nhalf throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But\\\\r\\\\nhe was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing\\\\r\\\\nthe heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed,\\\\r\\\\nand he was flung into a cagelike crate.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath\\\\r\\\\nand wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did\\\\r\\\\nthey want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent\\\\r\\\\nup in this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by\\\\r\\\\nthe vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night\\\\r\\\\nhe sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see\\\\r\\\\nthe Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face\\\\r\\\\nof the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a\\\\r\\\\ntallow candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nthroat was twisted into a savage growl.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men\\\\r\\\\nentered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for\\\\r\\\\nthey were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed\\\\r\\\\nand raged at them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks\\\\r\\\\nat him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that\\\\r\\\\nthat was what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed\\\\r\\\\nthe crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he\\\\r\\\\nwas imprisoned, began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the\\\\r\\\\nexpress office took charge of him; he was carted about in another\\\\r\\\\nwagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels,\\\\r\\\\nupon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great\\\\r\\\\nrailway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail\\\\r\\\\nof shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate\\\\r\\\\nnor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express\\\\r\\\\nmessengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he\\\\r\\\\nflung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at\\\\r\\\\nhim and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs,\\\\r\\\\nmewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he\\\\r\\\\nknew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger\\\\r\\\\nwaxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of\\\\r\\\\nwater caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch.\\\\r\\\\nFor that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment\\\\r\\\\nhad flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his\\\\r\\\\nparched and swollen throat and tongue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given\\\\r\\\\nthem an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.\\\\r\\\\nThey would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was\\\\r\\\\nresolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during\\\\r\\\\nthose two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath\\\\r\\\\nthat boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned\\\\r\\\\nblood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed\\\\r\\\\nwas he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the\\\\r\\\\nexpress messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the\\\\r\\\\ntrain at Seattle.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFour men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,\\\\r\\\\nhigh-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged\\\\r\\\\ngenerously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.\\\\r\\\\nThat was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled\\\\r\\\\nhimself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a\\\\r\\\\nhatchet and a club.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou ain\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to take him out now?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the driver asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried\\\\r\\\\nit in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the\\\\r\\\\nperformance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging\\\\r\\\\nand wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was\\\\r\\\\nthere on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get\\\\r\\\\nout as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, you red-eyed devil,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, when he had made an opening\\\\r\\\\nsufficient for the passage of Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body. At the same time he dropped\\\\r\\\\nthe hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for\\\\r\\\\nthe spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his\\\\r\\\\nblood-shot eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and\\\\r\\\\nforty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and\\\\r\\\\nnights. In mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he\\\\r\\\\nreceived a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together\\\\r\\\\nwith an agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his\\\\r\\\\nback and side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did\\\\r\\\\nnot understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was\\\\r\\\\nagain on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came\\\\r\\\\nand he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware\\\\r\\\\nthat it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he\\\\r\\\\ncharged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAfter a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to\\\\r\\\\nrush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth\\\\r\\\\nand ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.\\\\r\\\\nThen the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on\\\\r\\\\nthe nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the\\\\r\\\\nexquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its\\\\r\\\\nferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the\\\\r\\\\nclub from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the\\\\r\\\\nsame time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete\\\\r\\\\ncircle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on\\\\r\\\\nhis head and chest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had\\\\r\\\\npurposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,\\\\r\\\\nknocked utterly senseless.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no slouch at dog-breakin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wot I say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d one of the men on\\\\r\\\\nthe wall cried enthusiastically.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDruther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was the reply of\\\\r\\\\nthe driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he\\\\r\\\\nhad fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Answers to the name of Buck,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the man soliloquized, quoting from the\\\\r\\\\nsaloon-keeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate\\\\r\\\\nand contents. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Buck, my boy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he went on in a genial voice,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let\\\\r\\\\nit go at that. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good\\\\r\\\\ndog and all \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\r\\\\nwhale the stuffin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 outa you. Understand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly\\\\r\\\\npounded, and though Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the\\\\r\\\\nhand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he\\\\r\\\\ndrank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by\\\\r\\\\nchunk, from the man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for\\\\r\\\\nall, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned\\\\r\\\\nthe lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was\\\\r\\\\na revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,\\\\r\\\\nand he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a\\\\r\\\\nfiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it\\\\r\\\\nwith all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by,\\\\r\\\\nother dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and\\\\r\\\\nsome raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched\\\\r\\\\nthem pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and\\\\r\\\\nagain, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven\\\\r\\\\nhome to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed,\\\\r\\\\nthough not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty,\\\\r\\\\nthough he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged\\\\r\\\\ntheir tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would\\\\r\\\\nneither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for\\\\r\\\\nmastery.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNow and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,\\\\r\\\\nand in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such\\\\r\\\\ntimes that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of\\\\r\\\\nthe dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never\\\\r\\\\ncame back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was\\\\r\\\\nglad each time when he was not selected.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who\\\\r\\\\nspat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which\\\\r\\\\nBuck could not understand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSacredam!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDat one dam bully\\\\r\\\\ndog! Eh? How moch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree hundred, and a present at that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was the prompt reply of the man\\\\r\\\\nin the red sweater. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd seem\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s government money, you ain\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got no\\\\r\\\\nkick coming, eh, Perrault?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed\\\\r\\\\nskyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an\\\\r\\\\nanimal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its\\\\r\\\\ndespatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at\\\\r\\\\nBuck he knew that he was one in a thousand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne in ten t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ousand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\ncommented mentally.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a\\\\r\\\\ngood-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened\\\\r\\\\nman. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as\\\\r\\\\nCurly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the _Narwhal_,\\\\r\\\\nit was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken\\\\r\\\\nbelow by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was\\\\r\\\\na French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new\\\\r\\\\nkind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and\\\\r\\\\nwhile he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew\\\\r\\\\nhonestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice,\\\\r\\\\nand too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99tween-decks of the _Narwhal_, Buck and Curly joined two other\\\\r\\\\ndogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had\\\\r\\\\nbeen brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a\\\\r\\\\nGeological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous\\\\r\\\\nsort of way, smiling into one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face the while he meditated some\\\\r\\\\nunderhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s food at\\\\r\\\\nthe first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nwhip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing\\\\r\\\\nremained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, he\\\\r\\\\ndecided, and the half-breed began his rise in Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s estimation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not\\\\r\\\\nattempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow,\\\\r\\\\nand he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone,\\\\r\\\\nand further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDave\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times,\\\\r\\\\nand took interest in nothing, not even when the _Narwhal_ crossed Queen\\\\r\\\\nCharlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing\\\\r\\\\npossessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he\\\\r\\\\nraised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious\\\\r\\\\nglance, yawned, and went to sleep again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDay and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,\\\\r\\\\nand though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that\\\\r\\\\nthe weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the\\\\r\\\\npropeller was quiet, and the _Narwhal_ was pervaded with an atmosphere\\\\r\\\\nof excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a\\\\r\\\\nchange was at hand. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois leashed them and brought them on deck. At\\\\r\\\\nthe first step upon the cold surface, Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet sank into a white\\\\r\\\\nmushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of\\\\r\\\\nthis white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but\\\\r\\\\nmore of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up\\\\r\\\\non his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This\\\\r\\\\npuzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers\\\\r\\\\nlaughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was\\\\r\\\\nhis first snow.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChapter II. The Law of Club and Fang\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was\\\\r\\\\nfilled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the\\\\r\\\\nheart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. No\\\\r\\\\nlazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be\\\\r\\\\nbored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safety. All was\\\\r\\\\nconfusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.\\\\r\\\\nThere was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and\\\\r\\\\nmen were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who\\\\r\\\\nknew no law but the law of club and fang.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his\\\\r\\\\nfirst experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was\\\\r\\\\na vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.\\\\r\\\\nCurly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she,\\\\r\\\\nin her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a\\\\r\\\\nfull-grown wolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning,\\\\r\\\\nonly a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out\\\\r\\\\nequally swift, and Curly\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there\\\\r\\\\nwas more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and\\\\r\\\\nsurrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not\\\\r\\\\ncomprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they\\\\r\\\\nwere licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again\\\\r\\\\nand leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar\\\\r\\\\nfashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This\\\\r\\\\nwas what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her,\\\\r\\\\nsnarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath\\\\r\\\\nthe bristling mass of bodies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSo sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw\\\\r\\\\nSpitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he\\\\r\\\\nsaw Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men\\\\r\\\\nwith clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two\\\\r\\\\nminutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were\\\\r\\\\nclubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody,\\\\r\\\\ntrampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed\\\\r\\\\nstanding over her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to\\\\r\\\\nBuck to trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play.\\\\r\\\\nOnce down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he\\\\r\\\\nnever went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from\\\\r\\\\nthat moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBefore he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of\\\\r\\\\nCurly, he received another shock. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois fastened upon him an\\\\r\\\\narrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had\\\\r\\\\nseen the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses\\\\r\\\\nwork, so he was set to work, hauling Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois on a sled to the forest\\\\r\\\\nthat fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though\\\\r\\\\nhis dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was\\\\r\\\\ntoo wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though\\\\r\\\\nit was all new and strange. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was stern, demanding instant\\\\r\\\\nobedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while\\\\r\\\\nDave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hind quarters\\\\r\\\\nwhenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,\\\\r\\\\nand while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now\\\\r\\\\nand again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck\\\\r\\\\ninto the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined\\\\r\\\\ntuition of his two mates and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois made remarkable progress. Ere\\\\r\\\\nthey returned to camp he knew enough to stop at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cho,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to go ahead at\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmush,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler\\\\r\\\\nwhen the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ree vair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 good dogs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois told Perrault. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDat Buck, heem pool\\\\r\\\\nlak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his\\\\r\\\\ndespatches, returned with two more dogs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBillee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJoe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he called\\\\r\\\\nthem, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother\\\\r\\\\nthough they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one\\\\r\\\\nfault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite,\\\\r\\\\nsour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.\\\\r\\\\nBuck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz\\\\r\\\\nproceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his\\\\r\\\\ntail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no\\\\r\\\\navail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sharp teeth scored\\\\r\\\\nhis flank. But no matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his\\\\r\\\\nheels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and\\\\r\\\\nsnarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes\\\\r\\\\ndiabolically gleaming\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible\\\\r\\\\nwas his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him;\\\\r\\\\nbut to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and\\\\r\\\\nwailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean\\\\r\\\\nand gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a\\\\r\\\\nwarning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks,\\\\r\\\\nwhich means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing,\\\\r\\\\nexpected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into\\\\r\\\\ntheir midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which\\\\r\\\\nBuck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached\\\\r\\\\non his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the\\\\r\\\\nfirst knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled\\\\r\\\\nupon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and\\\\r\\\\ndown. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of\\\\r\\\\ntheir comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like\\\\r\\\\nDave\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn,\\\\r\\\\neach of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThat night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent,\\\\r\\\\nillumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain;\\\\r\\\\nand when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he\\\\r\\\\nrecovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer\\\\r\\\\ncold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with\\\\r\\\\nespecial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and\\\\r\\\\nattempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet.\\\\r\\\\nMiserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents,\\\\r\\\\nonly to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there\\\\r\\\\nsavage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled\\\\r\\\\n(for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFinally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own\\\\r\\\\nteam-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared.\\\\r\\\\nAgain he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and\\\\r\\\\nagain he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else\\\\r\\\\nhe would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be?\\\\r\\\\nWith drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he\\\\r\\\\naimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore\\\\r\\\\nlegs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang\\\\r\\\\nback, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a\\\\r\\\\nfriendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A\\\\r\\\\nwhiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under\\\\r\\\\nthe snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed\\\\r\\\\nand wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured,\\\\r\\\\nas a bribe for peace, to lick Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face with his warm wet tongue.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnother lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently\\\\r\\\\nselected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a\\\\r\\\\nhole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined\\\\r\\\\nspace and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he\\\\r\\\\nslept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and\\\\r\\\\nwrestled with bad dreams.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.\\\\r\\\\nAt first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night\\\\r\\\\nand he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side,\\\\r\\\\nand a great surge of fear swept through him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the fear of the wild thing\\\\r\\\\nfor the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own\\\\r\\\\nlife to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an\\\\r\\\\nunduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so\\\\r\\\\ncould not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted\\\\r\\\\nspasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders\\\\r\\\\nstood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into\\\\r\\\\nthe blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he\\\\r\\\\nlanded on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and\\\\r\\\\nknew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he\\\\r\\\\nwent for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the\\\\r\\\\nnight before.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA shout from Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois hailed his appearance. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWot I say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the\\\\r\\\\ndog-driver cried to Perrault. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDat Buck for sure learn queek as\\\\r\\\\nanyt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government,\\\\r\\\\nbearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs,\\\\r\\\\nand he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a\\\\r\\\\ntotal of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they\\\\r\\\\nwere in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Ca\\\\xc3\\\\xb1on. Buck\\\\r\\\\nwas glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not\\\\r\\\\nparticularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which\\\\r\\\\nanimated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still\\\\r\\\\nmore surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were\\\\r\\\\nnew dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and\\\\r\\\\nunconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious\\\\r\\\\nthat the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by\\\\r\\\\ndelay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed\\\\r\\\\nthe supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and\\\\r\\\\nthe only thing in which they took delight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then\\\\r\\\\ncame Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,\\\\r\\\\nto the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he\\\\r\\\\nmight receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally\\\\r\\\\napt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing\\\\r\\\\ntheir teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He\\\\r\\\\nnever nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he\\\\r\\\\nstood in need of it. As Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whip backed him up, Buck found it to\\\\r\\\\nbe cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief\\\\r\\\\nhalt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both\\\\r\\\\nDave and Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The\\\\r\\\\nresulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the\\\\r\\\\ntraces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he\\\\r\\\\nmastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whip\\\\r\\\\nsnapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up\\\\r\\\\nhis feet and carefully examining them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a hard day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s run, up the Ca\\\\xc3\\\\xb1on, through Sheep Camp, past the\\\\r\\\\nScales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of\\\\r\\\\nfeet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the\\\\r\\\\nsalt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely\\\\r\\\\nNorth. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the\\\\r\\\\ncraters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge\\\\r\\\\ncamp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were\\\\r\\\\nbuilding boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made\\\\r\\\\nhis hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all\\\\r\\\\ntoo early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his\\\\r\\\\nmates to the sled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThat day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next\\\\r\\\\nday, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked\\\\r\\\\nharder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of\\\\r\\\\nthe team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for\\\\r\\\\nthem. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged\\\\r\\\\nplaces with him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided\\\\r\\\\nhimself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for\\\\r\\\\nthe fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was\\\\r\\\\nno ice at all.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDay after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,\\\\r\\\\nthey broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them\\\\r\\\\nhitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always\\\\r\\\\nthey pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to\\\\r\\\\nsleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of\\\\r\\\\nsun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go\\\\r\\\\nnowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.\\\\r\\\\nYet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the\\\\r\\\\nlife, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good\\\\r\\\\ncondition.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old\\\\r\\\\nlife. A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed\\\\r\\\\nhim of his unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was\\\\r\\\\nfighting off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the\\\\r\\\\nothers. To remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did\\\\r\\\\nhunger compel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him.\\\\r\\\\nHe watched and learned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever\\\\r\\\\nmalingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back\\\\r\\\\nwas turned, he duplicated the performance the following day, getting\\\\r\\\\naway with the whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was\\\\r\\\\nunsuspected; while Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting\\\\r\\\\ncaught, was punished for Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s misdeed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland\\\\r\\\\nenvironment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself\\\\r\\\\nto changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and\\\\r\\\\nterrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his\\\\r\\\\nmoral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for\\\\r\\\\nexistence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of\\\\r\\\\nlove and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;\\\\r\\\\nbut in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such\\\\r\\\\nthings into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he\\\\r\\\\nwould fail to prosper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNot that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and\\\\r\\\\nunconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his\\\\r\\\\ndays, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But the\\\\r\\\\nclub of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more\\\\r\\\\nfundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a\\\\r\\\\nmoral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s riding-whip; but\\\\r\\\\nthe completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability\\\\r\\\\nto flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.\\\\r\\\\nHe did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his\\\\r\\\\nstomach. He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out\\\\r\\\\nof respect for club and fang. In short, the things he did were done\\\\r\\\\nbecause it was easier to do them than not to do them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard\\\\r\\\\nas iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an\\\\r\\\\ninternal as well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter\\\\r\\\\nhow loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his\\\\r\\\\nstomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood\\\\r\\\\ncarried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the\\\\r\\\\ntoughest and stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably\\\\r\\\\nkeen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he\\\\r\\\\nheard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril.\\\\r\\\\nHe learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between\\\\r\\\\nhis toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice\\\\r\\\\nover the water hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with\\\\r\\\\nstiff fore legs. His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the\\\\r\\\\nwind and forecast it a night in advance. No matter how breathless the\\\\r\\\\nair when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew\\\\r\\\\ninevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became\\\\r\\\\nalive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways\\\\r\\\\nhe remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs\\\\r\\\\nranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as\\\\r\\\\nthey ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and\\\\r\\\\nslash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten\\\\r\\\\nancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks\\\\r\\\\nwhich they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.\\\\r\\\\nThey came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been\\\\r\\\\nhis always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at\\\\r\\\\na star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and\\\\r\\\\ndust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and\\\\r\\\\nthrough him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which\\\\r\\\\nvoiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and\\\\r\\\\nthe cold, and dark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged\\\\r\\\\nthrough him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had\\\\r\\\\nfound a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nhelper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers\\\\r\\\\nsmall copies of himself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChapter III. The Dominant Primordial Beast\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce\\\\r\\\\nconditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.\\\\r\\\\nHis newborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy\\\\r\\\\nadjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he\\\\r\\\\nnot pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A certain\\\\r\\\\ndeliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to rashness\\\\r\\\\nand precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz\\\\r\\\\nhe betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous\\\\r\\\\nrival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even\\\\r\\\\nwent out of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the\\\\r\\\\nfight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in\\\\r\\\\nthe trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted\\\\r\\\\naccident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp\\\\r\\\\non the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a\\\\r\\\\nwhite-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping\\\\r\\\\nplace. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a\\\\r\\\\nperpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois were compelled to\\\\r\\\\nmake their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake\\\\r\\\\nitself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light. A\\\\r\\\\nfew sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down\\\\r\\\\nthrough the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nClose in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm\\\\r\\\\nwas it, that he was loath to leave it when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois distributed the\\\\r\\\\nfish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished\\\\r\\\\nhis ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl\\\\r\\\\ntold him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided\\\\r\\\\ntrouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared.\\\\r\\\\nHe sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz\\\\r\\\\nparticularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him\\\\r\\\\nthat his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own\\\\r\\\\nonly because of his great weight and size.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the\\\\r\\\\ndisrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA-a-ah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\ncried to Buck. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty\\\\r\\\\nt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99eef!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness\\\\r\\\\nas he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no\\\\r\\\\nless eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth\\\\r\\\\nfor the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the\\\\r\\\\nthing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future,\\\\r\\\\npast many a weary mile of trail and toil.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony\\\\r\\\\nframe, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of\\\\r\\\\npandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking\\\\r\\\\nfurry forms,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had\\\\r\\\\nscented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck\\\\r\\\\nand Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with\\\\r\\\\nstout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed\\\\r\\\\nby the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the\\\\r\\\\ngrub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box\\\\r\\\\nwas capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished\\\\r\\\\nbrutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon\\\\r\\\\nthem unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but\\\\r\\\\nstruggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests\\\\r\\\\nonly to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such\\\\r\\\\ndogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.\\\\r\\\\nThey were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with\\\\r\\\\nblazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them\\\\r\\\\nterrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs\\\\r\\\\nwere swept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by\\\\r\\\\nthree huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and\\\\r\\\\nslashed. The din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and\\\\r\\\\nSol-leks, dripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely\\\\r\\\\nside by side. Joe was snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on\\\\r\\\\nthe fore leg of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike,\\\\r\\\\nthe malingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with\\\\r\\\\na quick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the\\\\r\\\\nthroat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the\\\\r\\\\njugular. The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater\\\\r\\\\nfierceness. He flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt\\\\r\\\\nteeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking\\\\r\\\\nfrom the side.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,\\\\r\\\\nhurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts\\\\r\\\\nrolled back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only\\\\r\\\\nfor a moment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub,\\\\r\\\\nupon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee,\\\\r\\\\nterrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away\\\\r\\\\nover the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the\\\\r\\\\nteam behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of\\\\r\\\\nthe tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident\\\\r\\\\nintention of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of\\\\r\\\\nhuskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock\\\\r\\\\nof Spitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLater, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the\\\\r\\\\nforest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not\\\\r\\\\none who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded\\\\r\\\\ngrievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky\\\\r\\\\nadded to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an\\\\r\\\\neye; while Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to\\\\r\\\\nribbons, cried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they\\\\r\\\\nlimped warily back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men\\\\r\\\\nin bad tempers. Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had\\\\r\\\\nchewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact,\\\\r\\\\nnothing, no matter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had\\\\r\\\\neaten a pair of Perrault\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the\\\\r\\\\nleather traces, and even two feet of lash from the end of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nwhip. He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his\\\\r\\\\nwounded dogs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, my frien\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said softly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many\\\\r\\\\nbites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ink, eh, Perrault?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail\\\\r\\\\nstill between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break\\\\r\\\\nout among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses\\\\r\\\\ninto shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling\\\\r\\\\npainfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,\\\\r\\\\nand for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,\\\\r\\\\nand it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held\\\\r\\\\nat all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty\\\\r\\\\nterrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was\\\\r\\\\naccomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,\\\\r\\\\nPerrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by\\\\r\\\\nthe long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time\\\\r\\\\nacross the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the\\\\r\\\\nthermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke\\\\r\\\\nthrough he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his\\\\r\\\\ngarments.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had\\\\r\\\\nbeen chosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks,\\\\r\\\\nresolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and\\\\r\\\\nstruggling on from dim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on\\\\r\\\\nrim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not\\\\r\\\\nhalt. Once, the sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were\\\\r\\\\nhalf-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The\\\\r\\\\nusual fire was necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with\\\\r\\\\nice, and the two men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and\\\\r\\\\nthawing, so close that they were singed by the flames.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him\\\\r\\\\nup to Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws\\\\r\\\\non the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But\\\\r\\\\nbehind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled\\\\r\\\\nwas Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, pulling till his tendons cracked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no\\\\r\\\\nescape except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled\\\\r\\\\nlashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs\\\\r\\\\nwere hoisted, one by one, to the cliff crest. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois came up last,\\\\r\\\\nafter the sled and load. Then came the search for a place to descend,\\\\r\\\\nwhich descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night\\\\r\\\\nfound them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ncredit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played\\\\r\\\\nout. The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make\\\\r\\\\nup lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they covered\\\\r\\\\nthirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to\\\\r\\\\nthe Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well\\\\r\\\\nup toward the Five Fingers.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.\\\\r\\\\nHis had softened during the many generations since the day his last\\\\r\\\\nwild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he\\\\r\\\\nlimped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry\\\\r\\\\nas he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois had to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet\\\\r\\\\nfor half an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of\\\\r\\\\nhis own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great\\\\r\\\\nrelief, and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist\\\\r\\\\nitself into a grin one morning, when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois forgot the moccasins and\\\\r\\\\nBuck lay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and\\\\r\\\\nrefused to budge without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail,\\\\r\\\\nand the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had\\\\r\\\\nnever been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced\\\\r\\\\nher condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog\\\\r\\\\nbristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a\\\\r\\\\ndog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew\\\\r\\\\nthat here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away\\\\r\\\\nhe raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could\\\\r\\\\nshe gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so\\\\r\\\\ngreat was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the\\\\r\\\\nisland, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with\\\\r\\\\nrough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the\\\\r\\\\nmain river, and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time,\\\\r\\\\nthough he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap\\\\r\\\\nbehind. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled\\\\r\\\\nback, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all\\\\r\\\\nhis faith in that Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois would save him. The dog-driver held the axe\\\\r\\\\npoised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon\\\\r\\\\nmad Dolly\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,\\\\r\\\\nhelpless. This was Spitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice\\\\r\\\\nhis teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh\\\\r\\\\nto the bone. Then Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lash descended, and Buck had the\\\\r\\\\nsatisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet\\\\r\\\\nadministered to any of the teams.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne devil, dat Spitz,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d remarked Perrault. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome dam day heem keel dat\\\\r\\\\nBuck.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDat Buck two devils,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rejoinder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll de tam I watch\\\\r\\\\ndat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak\\\\r\\\\nhell an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 den heem chew dat Spitz all up an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 spit heem out on de snow.\\\\r\\\\nSure. I know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and\\\\r\\\\nacknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this\\\\r\\\\nstrange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many\\\\r\\\\nSouthland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and\\\\r\\\\non trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and\\\\r\\\\nstarvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered,\\\\r\\\\nmatching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a\\\\r\\\\nmasterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club\\\\r\\\\nof the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness\\\\r\\\\nout of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could\\\\r\\\\nbide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck\\\\r\\\\nwanted it. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been\\\\r\\\\ngripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and\\\\r\\\\ntrace\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which\\\\r\\\\nlures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if\\\\r\\\\nthey are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as\\\\r\\\\nwheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride\\\\r\\\\nthat laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour\\\\r\\\\nand sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride\\\\r\\\\nthat spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at\\\\r\\\\nnight, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This\\\\r\\\\nwas the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who\\\\r\\\\nblundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in\\\\r\\\\nthe morning. Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a\\\\r\\\\npossible lead-dog. And this was Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pride, too.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe openly threatened the other\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leadership. He came between him and\\\\r\\\\nthe shirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One\\\\r\\\\nnight there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the\\\\r\\\\nmalingerer, did not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a\\\\r\\\\nfoot of snow. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was\\\\r\\\\nwild with wrath. He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in\\\\r\\\\nevery likely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and\\\\r\\\\nshivered in his hiding-place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him,\\\\r\\\\nBuck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so\\\\r\\\\nshrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.\\\\r\\\\nPike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,\\\\r\\\\nand sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a\\\\r\\\\nforgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, chuckling at\\\\r\\\\nthe incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought\\\\r\\\\nhis lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck\\\\r\\\\nfrom his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into\\\\r\\\\nplay. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash\\\\r\\\\nlaid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many\\\\r\\\\ntimes offending Pike.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still\\\\r\\\\ncontinued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it\\\\r\\\\ncraftily, when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,\\\\r\\\\na general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks\\\\r\\\\nwere unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.\\\\r\\\\nThings no longer went right. There was continual bickering and\\\\r\\\\njangling. Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck.\\\\r\\\\nHe kept Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension\\\\r\\\\nof the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take\\\\r\\\\nplace sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of\\\\r\\\\nquarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his\\\\r\\\\nsleeping robe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson\\\\r\\\\none dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many\\\\r\\\\nmen, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the\\\\r\\\\nordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up\\\\r\\\\nand down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling\\\\r\\\\nbells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up\\\\r\\\\nto the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa\\\\r\\\\nClara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main\\\\r\\\\nthey were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine,\\\\r\\\\nat twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie\\\\r\\\\nchant, in which it was Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s delight to join.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping\\\\r\\\\nin the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of\\\\r\\\\nsnow, this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life,\\\\r\\\\nonly it was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and\\\\r\\\\nhalf-sobs, and was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of\\\\r\\\\nexistence. It was an old song, old as the breed itself\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94one of the first\\\\r\\\\nsongs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was\\\\r\\\\ninvested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which\\\\r\\\\nBuck was so strangely stirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with\\\\r\\\\nthe pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and\\\\r\\\\nthe fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and\\\\r\\\\nmystery. And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness\\\\r\\\\nwith which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw\\\\r\\\\nbeginnings of life in the howling ages.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSeven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the\\\\r\\\\nsteep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and\\\\r\\\\nSalt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent\\\\r\\\\nthan those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,\\\\r\\\\nand he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things\\\\r\\\\nfavored him in this. The week\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rest had recuperated the dogs and put\\\\r\\\\nthem in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was\\\\r\\\\npacked hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged\\\\r\\\\nin two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was\\\\r\\\\ntravelling light.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThey made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and\\\\r\\\\nthe second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to\\\\r\\\\nPelly. But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble\\\\r\\\\nand vexation on the part of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois. The insidious revolt led by Buck\\\\r\\\\nhad destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog\\\\r\\\\nleaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them\\\\r\\\\ninto all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader\\\\r\\\\ngreatly to be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to\\\\r\\\\nchallenging his authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night,\\\\r\\\\nand gulped it down under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and\\\\r\\\\nJoe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. And\\\\r\\\\neven Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not\\\\r\\\\nhalf so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz\\\\r\\\\nwithout snarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct\\\\r\\\\napproached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down\\\\r\\\\nbefore Spitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very nose.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their\\\\r\\\\nrelations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever\\\\r\\\\namong themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and\\\\r\\\\nSol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the\\\\r\\\\nunending squabbling. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois swore strange barbarous oaths, and\\\\r\\\\nstamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always\\\\r\\\\nsinging among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back\\\\r\\\\nwas turned they were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip,\\\\r\\\\nwhile Buck backed up the remainder of the team. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois knew he was\\\\r\\\\nbehind all the trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever\\\\r\\\\never again to be caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the\\\\r\\\\nharness, for the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater\\\\r\\\\ndelight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the\\\\r\\\\ntraces.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a\\\\r\\\\nsnowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team\\\\r\\\\nwas in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest\\\\r\\\\nPolice, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit\\\\r\\\\nsped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed\\\\r\\\\nof which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow,\\\\r\\\\nwhile the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack,\\\\r\\\\nsixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay\\\\r\\\\ndown low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing\\\\r\\\\nforward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap,\\\\r\\\\nlike some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men\\\\r\\\\nout from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by\\\\r\\\\nchemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to\\\\r\\\\nkill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94all this was Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was\\\\r\\\\nranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the\\\\r\\\\nliving meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes\\\\r\\\\nin warm blood.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which\\\\r\\\\nlife cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes\\\\r\\\\nwhen one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that\\\\r\\\\none is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the\\\\r\\\\nartist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to\\\\r\\\\nthe soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it\\\\r\\\\ncame to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining\\\\r\\\\nafter the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through\\\\r\\\\nthe moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the\\\\r\\\\nparts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb\\\\r\\\\nof Time. He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave\\\\r\\\\nof being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in\\\\r\\\\nthat it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and\\\\r\\\\nrampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the\\\\r\\\\nstars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the\\\\r\\\\npack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long\\\\r\\\\nbend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the\\\\r\\\\nfrost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and\\\\r\\\\nlarger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate\\\\r\\\\npath of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the\\\\r\\\\nwhite teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a\\\\r\\\\nstricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging\\\\r\\\\ndown from Life\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nheels raised a hell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chorus of delight.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon\\\\r\\\\nSpitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They\\\\r\\\\nrolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost\\\\r\\\\nas though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder\\\\r\\\\nand leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel\\\\r\\\\njaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and\\\\r\\\\nlifting lips that writhed and snarled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As\\\\r\\\\nthey circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the\\\\r\\\\nadvantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He\\\\r\\\\nseemed to remember it all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the white woods, and earth, and moonlight,\\\\r\\\\nand the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a\\\\r\\\\nghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94nothing moved,\\\\r\\\\nnot a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and\\\\r\\\\nlingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe\\\\r\\\\nrabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn\\\\r\\\\nup in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only\\\\r\\\\ngleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was\\\\r\\\\nnothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had\\\\r\\\\nalways been, the wonted way of things.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and\\\\r\\\\nacross Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of\\\\r\\\\ndogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never\\\\r\\\\nblind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his\\\\r\\\\nenemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he\\\\r\\\\nwas prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first\\\\r\\\\ndefended that attack.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.\\\\r\\\\nWherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by\\\\r\\\\nthe fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,\\\\r\\\\nbut Buck could not penetrate his enemy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guard. Then he warmed up and\\\\r\\\\nenveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried\\\\r\\\\nfor the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and\\\\r\\\\neach time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took\\\\r\\\\nto rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his\\\\r\\\\nhead and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the\\\\r\\\\nshoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead,\\\\r\\\\nBuck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly\\\\r\\\\naway.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting\\\\r\\\\nhard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and\\\\r\\\\nwolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck\\\\r\\\\ngrew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for\\\\r\\\\nfooting. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs\\\\r\\\\nstarted up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle\\\\r\\\\nsank down again and waited.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94imagination. He\\\\r\\\\nfought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as\\\\r\\\\nthough attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept\\\\r\\\\nlow to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left fore leg.\\\\r\\\\nThere was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on\\\\r\\\\nthree legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick\\\\r\\\\nand broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz\\\\r\\\\nstruggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming\\\\r\\\\neyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in\\\\r\\\\nupon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten\\\\r\\\\nantagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing\\\\r\\\\nreserved for gentler climes. He man\\\\xc5\\\\x93uvred for the final rush. The\\\\r\\\\ncircle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on\\\\r\\\\nhis flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half\\\\r\\\\ncrouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to\\\\r\\\\nfall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz\\\\r\\\\nquivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with\\\\r\\\\nhorrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck\\\\r\\\\nsprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely\\\\r\\\\nmet shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as\\\\r\\\\nSpitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful\\\\r\\\\nchampion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found\\\\r\\\\nit good.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEh? Wot I say? I spik true w\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99en I say dat Buck two devils.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d This was\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and\\\\r\\\\nBuck covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light\\\\r\\\\npointed them out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDat Spitz fight lak hell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping\\\\r\\\\nrips and cuts.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dat Buck fight lak two hells,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s answer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now we\\\\r\\\\nmake good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the\\\\r\\\\ndog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place\\\\r\\\\nSpitz would have occupied as leader; but Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, not noticing him,\\\\r\\\\nbrought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was\\\\r\\\\nthe best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving\\\\r\\\\nhim back and standing in his place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEh? eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook at dat\\\\r\\\\nBuck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ink to take de job.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99way, Chook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, but Buck refused to budge.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled\\\\r\\\\nthreateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old\\\\r\\\\ndog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced\\\\r\\\\nSol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was angry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, by Gar, I feex you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, coming back\\\\r\\\\nwith a heavy club in his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor\\\\r\\\\ndid he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought\\\\r\\\\nforward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling\\\\r\\\\nwith bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so\\\\r\\\\nas to dodge it if thrown by Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, for he was become wise in the way\\\\r\\\\nof clubs. The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he\\\\r\\\\nwas ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated\\\\r\\\\ntwo or three steps. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois followed him up, whereupon he again\\\\r\\\\nretreated. After some time of this, Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois threw down the club,\\\\r\\\\nthinking that Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He\\\\r\\\\nwanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was\\\\r\\\\nhis by right. He had earned it, and he would not be content with less.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better\\\\r\\\\npart of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him,\\\\r\\\\nand his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after\\\\r\\\\nhim down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and\\\\r\\\\ndrop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept\\\\r\\\\nout of their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around\\\\r\\\\nand around the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met,\\\\r\\\\nhe would come in and be good.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch\\\\r\\\\nand swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an\\\\r\\\\nhour gone. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned\\\\r\\\\nsheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they\\\\r\\\\nwere beaten. Then Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called\\\\r\\\\nto Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\r\\\\nunfastened Sol-leks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s traces and put him back in his old place. The\\\\r\\\\nteam stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the\\\\r\\\\ntrail. There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99row down de club,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Perrault commanded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,\\\\r\\\\nand swung around into position at the head of the team. His traces were\\\\r\\\\nfastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed\\\\r\\\\nout on to the river trail.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHighly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he\\\\r\\\\nfound, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound\\\\r\\\\nBuck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,\\\\r\\\\nand quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior\\\\r\\\\neven of Spitz, of whom Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois had never seen an equal.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that\\\\r\\\\nBuck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.\\\\r\\\\nIt was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil\\\\r\\\\nmightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they\\\\r\\\\ndid not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for\\\\r\\\\nall they cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team,\\\\r\\\\nhowever, had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their\\\\r\\\\nsurprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPike, who pulled at Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heels, and who never put an ounce more of\\\\r\\\\nhis weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was\\\\r\\\\nswiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was\\\\r\\\\ndone he was pulling more than ever before in his life. The first night\\\\r\\\\nin camp, Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a thing that Spitz had\\\\r\\\\nnever succeeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of\\\\r\\\\nsuperior weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to\\\\r\\\\nwhine for mercy.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its\\\\r\\\\nold-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the\\\\r\\\\ntraces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were\\\\r\\\\nadded; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s breath.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNevaire such a dog as dat Buck!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, nevaire! Heem worth\\\\r\\\\none t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ousan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day\\\\r\\\\nby day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and\\\\r\\\\nthere was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too\\\\r\\\\ncold. The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there\\\\r\\\\nthe whole trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on\\\\r\\\\nthe jump, with but infrequent stoppages.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they\\\\r\\\\ncovered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In\\\\r\\\\none run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to\\\\r\\\\nthe White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy\\\\r\\\\nmiles of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to\\\\r\\\\nrun towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night\\\\r\\\\nof the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea\\\\r\\\\nslope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty\\\\r\\\\nmiles. For three days Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois threw chests up and down\\\\r\\\\nthe main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink,\\\\r\\\\nwhile the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of\\\\r\\\\ndog-busters and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to\\\\r\\\\nclean out the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and\\\\r\\\\npublic interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders.\\\\r\\\\nFran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him.\\\\r\\\\nAnd that was the last of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and Perrault. Like other men, they\\\\r\\\\npassed out of Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life for good.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company\\\\r\\\\nwith a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to\\\\r\\\\nDawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil\\\\r\\\\neach day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,\\\\r\\\\ncarrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the\\\\r\\\\nshadow of the Pole.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in\\\\r\\\\nit after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,\\\\r\\\\nwhether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a\\\\r\\\\nmonotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was\\\\r\\\\nvery like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,\\\\r\\\\nfires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,\\\\r\\\\nothers harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before\\\\r\\\\nthe darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.\\\\r\\\\nSome pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the\\\\r\\\\nbeds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the\\\\r\\\\ndogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it\\\\r\\\\nwas good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so\\\\r\\\\nwith the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were\\\\r\\\\nfierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought\\\\r\\\\nBuck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got\\\\r\\\\nout of his way.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBest of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched\\\\r\\\\nunder him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes\\\\r\\\\nblinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nbig house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement\\\\r\\\\nswimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the\\\\r\\\\nJapanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the\\\\r\\\\ndeath of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had\\\\r\\\\neaten or would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very\\\\r\\\\ndim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more\\\\r\\\\npotent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never\\\\r\\\\nseen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the\\\\r\\\\nmemories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later\\\\r\\\\ndays, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it\\\\r\\\\nseemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by\\\\r\\\\nthis other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed\\\\r\\\\ncook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,\\\\r\\\\nwith muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and\\\\r\\\\nswelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head\\\\r\\\\nslanted back under it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and\\\\r\\\\nseemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered\\\\r\\\\ncontinually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and\\\\r\\\\nfoot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but\\\\r\\\\nnaked, a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back,\\\\r\\\\nbut on his body there was much hair. In some places, across the chest\\\\r\\\\nand shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs, it was\\\\r\\\\nmatted into almost a thick fur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk\\\\r\\\\ninclined forward from the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About\\\\r\\\\nhis body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost\\\\r\\\\ncatlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of\\\\r\\\\nthings seen and unseen.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between\\\\r\\\\nhis legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his\\\\r\\\\nhands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.\\\\r\\\\nAnd beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many\\\\r\\\\ngleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the\\\\r\\\\neyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their\\\\r\\\\nbodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.\\\\r\\\\nAnd dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the\\\\r\\\\nfire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to\\\\r\\\\nrise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his\\\\r\\\\nneck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and\\\\r\\\\nthe half-breed cook shouted at him, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, you Buck, wake up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Whereupon\\\\r\\\\nthe other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and\\\\r\\\\nhe would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore\\\\r\\\\nthem down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they\\\\r\\\\nmade Dawson, and should have had a ten days\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 or a week\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rest at least.\\\\r\\\\nBut in two days\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the\\\\r\\\\nBarracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the\\\\r\\\\ndrivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This\\\\r\\\\nmeant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier\\\\r\\\\npulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did\\\\r\\\\ntheir best for the animals.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEach night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers\\\\r\\\\nate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet\\\\r\\\\nof the dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the\\\\r\\\\nbeginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles,\\\\r\\\\ndragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles\\\\r\\\\nwill tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates\\\\r\\\\nup to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very\\\\r\\\\ntired. Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.\\\\r\\\\nJoe was sourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side\\\\r\\\\nor other side.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with\\\\r\\\\nhim. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at\\\\r\\\\nonce made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness\\\\r\\\\nand down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the\\\\r\\\\nmorning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of\\\\r\\\\nthe sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The\\\\r\\\\ndriver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became\\\\r\\\\ninterested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over\\\\r\\\\ntheir last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a\\\\r\\\\nconsultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed\\\\r\\\\nand prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside,\\\\r\\\\nbut they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling\\\\r\\\\nrepeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took\\\\r\\\\nhim out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.\\\\r\\\\nHis intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled.\\\\r\\\\nSick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling\\\\r\\\\nwhile the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when\\\\r\\\\nhe saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the\\\\r\\\\npride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not\\\\r\\\\nbear that another dog should do his work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the\\\\r\\\\nbeaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him\\\\r\\\\nand trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side,\\\\r\\\\nstriving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled,\\\\r\\\\nand all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain.\\\\r\\\\nThe half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no\\\\r\\\\nheed to the stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike\\\\r\\\\nharder. Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where\\\\r\\\\nthe going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft\\\\r\\\\nsnow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell,\\\\r\\\\nand lay where he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds\\\\r\\\\nchurned by.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along\\\\r\\\\nbehind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the\\\\r\\\\nsleds to his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver\\\\r\\\\nlingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then\\\\r\\\\nhe returned and started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with\\\\r\\\\nremarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped\\\\r\\\\nin surprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He\\\\r\\\\ncalled his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both\\\\r\\\\nof Sol-leks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in\\\\r\\\\nhis proper place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His\\\\r\\\\ncomrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied\\\\r\\\\nthe work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where\\\\r\\\\ndogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut\\\\r\\\\nout of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die\\\\r\\\\nanyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he\\\\r\\\\nwas harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more\\\\r\\\\nthan once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.\\\\r\\\\nSeveral times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the\\\\r\\\\nsled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for\\\\r\\\\nhim by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up\\\\r\\\\ntime he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on\\\\r\\\\nhis feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly\\\\r\\\\ntoward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would\\\\r\\\\nadvance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching\\\\r\\\\nmovement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for\\\\r\\\\na few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of\\\\r\\\\nhim he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could\\\\r\\\\nhear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt\\\\r\\\\nof river timber.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHere the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his\\\\r\\\\nsteps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A\\\\r\\\\nrevolver-shot rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped,\\\\r\\\\nthe bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck\\\\r\\\\nknew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river\\\\r\\\\ntrees.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with\\\\r\\\\nBuck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a\\\\r\\\\nwretched state, worn out and worn down. Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one hundred and forty\\\\r\\\\npounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates,\\\\r\\\\nthough lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the\\\\r\\\\nmalingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully\\\\r\\\\nfeigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,\\\\r\\\\nand Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThey were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.\\\\r\\\\nTheir feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling\\\\r\\\\nthe fatigue of a day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s travel. There was nothing the matter with them\\\\r\\\\nexcept that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that\\\\r\\\\ncomes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a\\\\r\\\\nmatter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the\\\\r\\\\nslow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no\\\\r\\\\npower of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had\\\\r\\\\nbeen all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,\\\\r\\\\nevery cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less\\\\r\\\\nthan five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during\\\\r\\\\nthe last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rest.\\\\r\\\\nWhen they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.\\\\r\\\\nThey could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just\\\\r\\\\nmanaged to keep out of the way of the sled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMush on, poor sore feets,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the driver encouraged them as they tottered\\\\r\\\\ndown the main street of Skaguay. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDis is de las\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. Den we get one long\\\\r\\\\nres\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. Eh? For sure. One bully long res\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had\\\\r\\\\ncovered twelve hundred miles with two days\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rest, and in the nature of\\\\r\\\\nreason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so\\\\r\\\\nmany were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were\\\\r\\\\nthe sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the\\\\r\\\\ncongested mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were\\\\r\\\\nofficial orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the\\\\r\\\\nplaces of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be\\\\r\\\\ngot rid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they were\\\\r\\\\nto be sold.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really\\\\r\\\\ntired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two\\\\r\\\\nmen from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a\\\\r\\\\nsong. The men addressed each other as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCharles.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Charles was\\\\r\\\\na middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a\\\\r\\\\nmustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the\\\\r\\\\nlimply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or\\\\r\\\\ntwenty, with a big Colt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about\\\\r\\\\nhim on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the\\\\r\\\\nmost salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a callowness\\\\r\\\\nsheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why\\\\r\\\\nsuch as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of\\\\r\\\\nthings that passes understanding.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the\\\\r\\\\nGovernment agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the\\\\r\\\\nmail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of\\\\r\\\\nPerrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and the others who had gone before. When driven\\\\r\\\\nwith his mates to the new owners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 camp, Buck saw a slipshod and\\\\r\\\\nslovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in\\\\r\\\\ndisorder; also, he saw a woman. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMercedes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the men called her. She was\\\\r\\\\nCharles\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wife and Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a nice family party.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the\\\\r\\\\ntent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their\\\\r\\\\nmanner, but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward\\\\r\\\\nbundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were\\\\r\\\\npacked away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her\\\\r\\\\nmen and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When\\\\r\\\\nthey put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it\\\\r\\\\nshould go on the back; and when they had put it on the back, and\\\\r\\\\ncovered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered\\\\r\\\\noverlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very\\\\r\\\\nsack, and they unloaded again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and\\\\r\\\\nwinking at one another.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a right smart load as it is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of them; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nnot me should tell you your business, but I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tote that tent\\\\r\\\\nalong if I was you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUndreamed of!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHowever in the world could I manage without a tent?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s springtime, and you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get any more cold weather,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the man\\\\r\\\\nreplied.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nShe shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and\\\\r\\\\nends on top the mountainous load.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThink it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll ride?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d one of the men asked.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Charles demanded rather shortly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the man hastened meekly to\\\\r\\\\nsay. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was just a-wonderin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCharles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,\\\\r\\\\nwhich was not in the least well.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption\\\\r\\\\nbehind them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d affirmed a second of the men.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the\\\\r\\\\ngee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMush!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\r\\\\nshouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMush on there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few\\\\r\\\\nmoments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe lazy brutes, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he cried, preparing to lash out at\\\\r\\\\nthem with the whip.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Mercedes interfered, crying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Hal, you mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as she caught\\\\r\\\\nhold of the whip and wrenched it from him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe poor dears! Now you\\\\r\\\\nmust promise you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or\\\\r\\\\nI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go a step.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrecious lot you know about dogs,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d her brother sneered; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand I wish\\\\r\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave me alone. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lazy, I tell you, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to whip\\\\r\\\\nthem to get anything out of them. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s their way. You ask any one.\\\\r\\\\nAsk one of those men.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain\\\\r\\\\nwritten in her pretty face.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re weak as water, if you want to know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d came the reply from one\\\\r\\\\nof the men. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlum tuckered out, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter. They need a\\\\r\\\\nrest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRest be blanked,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes\\\\r\\\\nsaid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in pain and sorrow at the oath.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of\\\\r\\\\nher brother. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that man,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said pointedly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re driving\\\\r\\\\nour dogs, and you do what you think best with them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the\\\\r\\\\nbreast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,\\\\r\\\\nand put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an\\\\r\\\\nanchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was\\\\r\\\\nwhistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on\\\\r\\\\nher knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around\\\\r\\\\nhis neck.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou poor, poor dears,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried sympathetically, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhy don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you pull\\\\r\\\\nhard?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94then you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be whipped.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Buck did not like her, but he was\\\\r\\\\nfeeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nmiserable work.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot\\\\r\\\\nspeech, now spoke up:\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\r\\\\nsakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by\\\\r\\\\nbreaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight\\\\r\\\\nagainst the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,\\\\r\\\\nHal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The\\\\r\\\\noverloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates\\\\r\\\\nstruggling frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead\\\\r\\\\nthe path turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have\\\\r\\\\nrequired an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal\\\\r\\\\nwas not such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over,\\\\r\\\\nspilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never\\\\r\\\\nstopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were\\\\r\\\\nangry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust\\\\r\\\\nload. Buck was raging. He broke into a run, the team following his\\\\r\\\\nlead. Hal cried \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhoa! whoa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d but they gave no heed. He tripped and was\\\\r\\\\npulled off his feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs\\\\r\\\\ndashed on up the street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they\\\\r\\\\nscattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered\\\\r\\\\nbelongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,\\\\r\\\\nif they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his\\\\r\\\\nsister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and\\\\r\\\\noverhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men\\\\r\\\\nlaugh, for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlankets for a hotel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d quoth one of the men who laughed and helped.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHalf as many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and\\\\r\\\\nall those dishes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you\\\\r\\\\nthink you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re travelling on a Pullman?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes\\\\r\\\\ncried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after\\\\r\\\\narticle was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in\\\\r\\\\nparticular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees,\\\\r\\\\nrocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go\\\\r\\\\nan inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to\\\\r\\\\neverything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even\\\\r\\\\narticles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal,\\\\r\\\\nwhen she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her\\\\r\\\\nmen and went through them like a tornado.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a\\\\r\\\\nformidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six\\\\r\\\\nOutside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek\\\\r\\\\nand Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip,\\\\r\\\\nbrought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though\\\\r\\\\npractically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much.\\\\r\\\\nThree were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other\\\\r\\\\ntwo were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know\\\\r\\\\nanything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with\\\\r\\\\ndisgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not\\\\r\\\\nto do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly to\\\\r\\\\ntrace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were\\\\r\\\\nbewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which\\\\r\\\\nthey found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The\\\\r\\\\ntwo mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things\\\\r\\\\nbreakable about them.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by\\\\r\\\\ntwenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything\\\\r\\\\nbut bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were\\\\r\\\\nproud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs.\\\\r\\\\nThey had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in\\\\r\\\\nfrom Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen\\\\r\\\\ndogs. In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen\\\\r\\\\ndogs should not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not\\\\r\\\\ncarry the food for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know\\\\r\\\\nthis. They had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so\\\\r\\\\nmany dogs, so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders\\\\r\\\\nand nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLate next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was\\\\r\\\\nnothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They\\\\r\\\\nwere starting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance\\\\r\\\\nbetween Salt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired,\\\\r\\\\nhe was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was\\\\r\\\\nnot in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid\\\\r\\\\nand frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and\\\\r\\\\nthe woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went\\\\r\\\\nby it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all\\\\r\\\\nthings, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to\\\\r\\\\npitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get\\\\r\\\\nthe sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day\\\\r\\\\nthey were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they\\\\r\\\\ndid not make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started\\\\r\\\\nat all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the\\\\r\\\\ndistance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they\\\\r\\\\nhastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding\\\\r\\\\nwould commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained\\\\r\\\\nby chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.\\\\r\\\\nAnd when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal\\\\r\\\\ndecided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to\\\\r\\\\ncap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver\\\\r\\\\nin her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more,\\\\r\\\\nshe stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food\\\\r\\\\nthat Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making\\\\r\\\\npoor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThen came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his\\\\r\\\\ndog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,\\\\r\\\\nthat for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he\\\\r\\\\ncut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\ntravel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were\\\\r\\\\nfrustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a\\\\r\\\\nsimple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make\\\\r\\\\nthe dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way\\\\r\\\\nearlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not\\\\r\\\\nonly did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to\\\\r\\\\nwork themselves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always\\\\r\\\\ngetting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful\\\\r\\\\nworker. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from\\\\r\\\\nbad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s revolver.\\\\r\\\\nIt is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on\\\\r\\\\nthe ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no\\\\r\\\\nless than die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went\\\\r\\\\nfirst, followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels\\\\r\\\\nhanging more grittily on to life, but going in the end.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBy this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had\\\\r\\\\nfallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,\\\\r\\\\nArctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and\\\\r\\\\nwomanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied\\\\r\\\\nwith weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and\\\\r\\\\nbrother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.\\\\r\\\\nTheir irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it,\\\\r\\\\ndoubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail\\\\r\\\\nwhich comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of\\\\r\\\\nspeech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They\\\\r\\\\nhad no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their\\\\r\\\\nmuscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because\\\\r\\\\nof this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their\\\\r\\\\nlips in the morning and last at night.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nCharles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was\\\\r\\\\nthe cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the\\\\r\\\\nwork, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.\\\\r\\\\nSometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.\\\\r\\\\nThe result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from a\\\\r\\\\ndispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute\\\\r\\\\nwhich concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be lugged in the\\\\r\\\\nrest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands\\\\r\\\\nof miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s views on art, or the\\\\r\\\\nsort of society plays his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brother wrote, should have anything\\\\r\\\\nto do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes\\\\r\\\\ncomprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that\\\\r\\\\ndirection as in the direction of Charles\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s political prejudices. And\\\\r\\\\nthat Charles\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the\\\\r\\\\nbuilding of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who\\\\r\\\\ndisburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and\\\\r\\\\nincidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her\\\\r\\\\nhusband\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s family. In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp\\\\r\\\\nhalf pitched, and the dogs unfed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMercedes nursed a special grievance\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the grievance of sex. She was\\\\r\\\\npretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But\\\\r\\\\nthe present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save\\\\r\\\\nchivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon\\\\r\\\\nwhich impeachment of what to her was her most essential\\\\r\\\\nsex-prerogative, she made their lives unendurable. She no longer\\\\r\\\\nconsidered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted\\\\r\\\\nin riding on the sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed one\\\\r\\\\nhundred and twenty pounds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the\\\\r\\\\nweak and starving animals. She rode for days, till they fell in the\\\\r\\\\ntraces and the sled stood still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off\\\\r\\\\nand walk, pleaded with her, entreated, the while she wept and\\\\r\\\\nimportuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never\\\\r\\\\ndid it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat\\\\r\\\\ndown on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After\\\\r\\\\nthey had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for\\\\r\\\\nher, and by main strength put her on the sled again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of\\\\r\\\\ntheir animals. Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s theory, which he practised on others, was that one\\\\r\\\\nmust get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and\\\\r\\\\nbrother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a\\\\r\\\\nclub. At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old\\\\r\\\\nsquaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the\\\\r\\\\nColt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hip. A\\\\r\\\\npoor substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped\\\\r\\\\nfrom the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen\\\\r\\\\nstate it was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog\\\\r\\\\nwrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious\\\\r\\\\nleathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and\\\\r\\\\nindigestible.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a\\\\r\\\\nnightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he\\\\r\\\\nfell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to\\\\r\\\\nhis feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his\\\\r\\\\nbeautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted\\\\r\\\\nwith dried blood where Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s club had bruised him. His muscles had\\\\r\\\\nwasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so\\\\r\\\\nthat each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through\\\\r\\\\nthe loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was\\\\r\\\\nheartbreaking, only Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart was unbreakable. The man in the red\\\\r\\\\nsweater had proved that.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating\\\\r\\\\nskeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very\\\\r\\\\ngreat misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the\\\\r\\\\nbruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant, just\\\\r\\\\nas the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and\\\\r\\\\ndistant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply\\\\r\\\\nso many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a\\\\r\\\\nhalt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the\\\\r\\\\nspark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip\\\\r\\\\nfell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to\\\\r\\\\ntheir feet and staggered on.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not\\\\r\\\\nrise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked\\\\r\\\\nBillee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of\\\\r\\\\nthe harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw,\\\\r\\\\nand they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day\\\\r\\\\nKoona went, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be\\\\r\\\\nmalignant; Pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not\\\\r\\\\nconscious enough longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still\\\\r\\\\nfaithful to the toil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so\\\\r\\\\nlittle strength with which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far\\\\r\\\\nthat winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was\\\\r\\\\nfresher; and Buck, still at the head of the team, but no longer\\\\r\\\\nenforcing discipline or striving to enforce it, blind with weakness\\\\r\\\\nhalf the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim\\\\r\\\\nfeel of his feet.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware\\\\r\\\\nof it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by\\\\r\\\\nthree in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The\\\\r\\\\nwhole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had\\\\r\\\\ngiven way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur\\\\r\\\\narose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from\\\\r\\\\nthe things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead\\\\r\\\\nand which had not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was\\\\r\\\\nrising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young\\\\r\\\\nbuds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets\\\\r\\\\nsang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling\\\\r\\\\nthings rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were\\\\r\\\\nbooming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds\\\\r\\\\nsinging, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in\\\\r\\\\ncunning wedges that split the air.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of\\\\r\\\\nunseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon\\\\r\\\\nwas straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away\\\\r\\\\nfrom beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang\\\\r\\\\nand spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into\\\\r\\\\nthe river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening\\\\r\\\\nlife, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like\\\\r\\\\nwayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWith the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing\\\\r\\\\ninnocuously, and Charles\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into\\\\r\\\\nJohn Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the\\\\r\\\\ndogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes\\\\r\\\\ndried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log\\\\r\\\\nto rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great\\\\r\\\\nstiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last\\\\r\\\\ntouches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled\\\\r\\\\nand listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse\\\\r\\\\nadvice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that\\\\r\\\\nit would not be followed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail\\\\r\\\\nand that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hal said in\\\\r\\\\nresponse to Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s warning to take no more chances on the rotten\\\\r\\\\nice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey told us we couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make White River, and here we are.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d This\\\\r\\\\nlast with a sneering ring of triumph in it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd they told you true,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d John Thornton answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe bottom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s likely\\\\r\\\\nto drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,\\\\r\\\\ncould have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk my carcass on\\\\r\\\\nthat ice for all the gold in Alaska.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not a fool, I suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hal. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll the same,\\\\r\\\\nwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go on to Dawson.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He uncoiled his whip. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet up there, Buck! Hi!\\\\r\\\\nGet up there! Mush on!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool\\\\r\\\\nand his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter\\\\r\\\\nthe scheme of things.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed\\\\r\\\\ninto the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed\\\\r\\\\nout, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed\\\\r\\\\nhis lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed.\\\\r\\\\nJoe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he\\\\r\\\\nfell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck\\\\r\\\\nmade no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into\\\\r\\\\nhim again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times\\\\r\\\\nThornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture\\\\r\\\\ncame into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked\\\\r\\\\nirresolutely up and down.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason\\\\r\\\\nto drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club.\\\\r\\\\nBuck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell\\\\r\\\\nupon him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike\\\\r\\\\nthem, he had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of\\\\r\\\\nimpending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the\\\\r\\\\nbank, and it had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten ice\\\\r\\\\nhe had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster\\\\r\\\\nclose at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying\\\\r\\\\nto drive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so\\\\r\\\\nfar gone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they\\\\r\\\\ncontinued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went\\\\r\\\\ndown. It was nearly out. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great\\\\r\\\\ndistance, he was aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of\\\\r\\\\npain left him. He no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could\\\\r\\\\nhear the impact of the club upon his body. But it was no longer his\\\\r\\\\nbody, it seemed so far away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was\\\\r\\\\ninarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang\\\\r\\\\nupon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though\\\\r\\\\nstruck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on\\\\r\\\\nwistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his\\\\r\\\\nstiffness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJohn Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too\\\\r\\\\nconvulsed with rage to speak.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you strike that dog again, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll kill you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he at last managed to\\\\r\\\\nsay in a choking voice.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s my dog,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came\\\\r\\\\nback. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out of my way, or I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll fix you. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to Dawson.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of\\\\r\\\\ngetting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes\\\\r\\\\nscreamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of\\\\r\\\\nhysteria. Thornton rapped Hal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking\\\\r\\\\nthe knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to\\\\r\\\\npick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes\\\\r\\\\ncut Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s traces.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his\\\\r\\\\nsister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of\\\\r\\\\nfurther use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out\\\\r\\\\nfrom the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his\\\\r\\\\nhead to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between\\\\r\\\\nwere Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was\\\\r\\\\nriding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles\\\\r\\\\nstumbled along in the rear.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly\\\\r\\\\nhands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed\\\\r\\\\nnothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the\\\\r\\\\nsled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling\\\\r\\\\nalong over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into\\\\r\\\\na rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air.\\\\r\\\\nMercedes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make\\\\r\\\\none step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs\\\\r\\\\nand humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The\\\\r\\\\nbottom had dropped out of the trail.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJohn Thornton and Buck looked at each other.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou poor devil,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChapter VI. For the Love of a Man\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners\\\\r\\\\nhad made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves\\\\r\\\\nup the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still\\\\r\\\\nlimping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued\\\\r\\\\nwarm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the\\\\r\\\\nriver bank through the long spring days, watching the running water,\\\\r\\\\nlistening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck\\\\r\\\\nslowly won back his strength.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,\\\\r\\\\nand it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his\\\\r\\\\nmuscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For\\\\r\\\\nthat matter, they were all loafing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and\\\\r\\\\nNig,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to\\\\r\\\\nDawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with\\\\r\\\\nBuck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first\\\\r\\\\nadvances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a\\\\r\\\\nmother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nwounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,\\\\r\\\\nshe performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her\\\\r\\\\nministrations as much as he did for Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Nig, equally friendly,\\\\r\\\\nthough less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and\\\\r\\\\nhalf deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They\\\\r\\\\nseemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck\\\\r\\\\ngrew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in\\\\r\\\\nwhich Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion\\\\r\\\\nBuck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love,\\\\r\\\\ngenuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never\\\\r\\\\nexperienced at Judge Miller\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara\\\\r\\\\nValley. With the Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a\\\\r\\\\nworking partnership; with the Judge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s grandsons, a sort of pompous\\\\r\\\\nguardianship; and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified\\\\r\\\\nfriendship. But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration,\\\\r\\\\nthat was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was\\\\r\\\\nthe ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a\\\\r\\\\nsense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as\\\\r\\\\nif they were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw\\\\r\\\\nfurther. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to\\\\r\\\\nsit down for a long talk with them (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he called it) was as much his\\\\r\\\\ndelight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head roughly between\\\\r\\\\nhis hands, and resting his own head upon Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, of shaking him back\\\\r\\\\nand forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love\\\\r\\\\nnames. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound\\\\r\\\\nof murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his\\\\r\\\\nheart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. And\\\\r\\\\nwhen, released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes\\\\r\\\\neloquent, his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion\\\\r\\\\nremained without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim,\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGod! you can all but speak!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would\\\\r\\\\noften seize Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the\\\\r\\\\nflesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as\\\\r\\\\nBuck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this\\\\r\\\\nfeigned bite for a caress.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor the most part, however, Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s love was expressed in adoration.\\\\r\\\\nWhile he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to\\\\r\\\\nhim, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove\\\\r\\\\nher nose under Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,\\\\r\\\\nwho would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knee, Buck was\\\\r\\\\ncontent to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert,\\\\r\\\\nat Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it,\\\\r\\\\nstudying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression,\\\\r\\\\nevery movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he\\\\r\\\\nwould lie farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of\\\\r\\\\nthe man and the occasional movements of his body. And often, such was\\\\r\\\\nthe communion in which they lived, the strength of Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gaze would\\\\r\\\\ndraw John Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head around, and he would return the gaze, without\\\\r\\\\nspeech, his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart shone out.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out\\\\r\\\\nof his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it\\\\r\\\\nagain, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he\\\\r\\\\nhad come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could\\\\r\\\\nbe permanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as\\\\r\\\\nPerrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in\\\\r\\\\nthe night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times he\\\\r\\\\nwould shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the\\\\r\\\\ntent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nbreathing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed to\\\\r\\\\nbespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,\\\\r\\\\nwhich the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.\\\\r\\\\nFaithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet\\\\r\\\\nhe retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come\\\\r\\\\nin from the wild to sit by John Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fire, rather than a dog of\\\\r\\\\nthe soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of\\\\r\\\\ncivilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from\\\\r\\\\nthis man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not\\\\r\\\\nhesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him\\\\r\\\\nto escape detection.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he fought\\\\r\\\\nas fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too\\\\r\\\\ngood-natured for quarrelling,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94besides, they belonged to John Thornton;\\\\r\\\\nbut the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly\\\\r\\\\nacknowledged Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with\\\\r\\\\na terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well the\\\\r\\\\nlaw of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back\\\\r\\\\nfrom a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned from\\\\r\\\\nSpitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and\\\\r\\\\nknew there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while\\\\r\\\\nto show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial\\\\r\\\\nlife. It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made\\\\r\\\\nfor death. Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this\\\\r\\\\nmandate, down out of the depths of Time, he obeyed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He\\\\r\\\\nlinked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed\\\\r\\\\nthrough him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and\\\\r\\\\nseasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fire, a broad-breasted dog,\\\\r\\\\nwhite-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all\\\\r\\\\nmanner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,\\\\r\\\\ntasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,\\\\r\\\\nscenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the\\\\r\\\\nsounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,\\\\r\\\\ndirecting his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,\\\\r\\\\nand dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff\\\\r\\\\nof his dreams.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSo peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and\\\\r\\\\nthe claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a\\\\r\\\\ncall was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously\\\\r\\\\nthrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire\\\\r\\\\nand the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on\\\\r\\\\nand on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the\\\\r\\\\ncall sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he\\\\r\\\\ngained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John\\\\r\\\\nThornton drew him back to the fire again.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance\\\\r\\\\ntravellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and\\\\r\\\\nfrom a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When\\\\r\\\\nThornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,\\\\r\\\\nBuck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to\\\\r\\\\nThornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way,\\\\r\\\\naccepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. They\\\\r\\\\nwere of the same large type as Thornton, living close to the earth,\\\\r\\\\nthinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into\\\\r\\\\nthe big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his\\\\r\\\\nways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet\\\\r\\\\nand Nig.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone\\\\r\\\\namong men, could put a pack upon Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back in the summer travelling.\\\\r\\\\nNothing was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day\\\\r\\\\n(they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left\\\\r\\\\nDawson for the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting\\\\r\\\\non the crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked\\\\r\\\\nbed-rock three hundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the\\\\r\\\\nedge, Buck at his shoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he\\\\r\\\\ndrew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJump, Buck!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm.\\\\r\\\\nThe next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while\\\\r\\\\nHans and Pete were dragging them back into safety.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s uncanny,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their\\\\r\\\\nspeech.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton shook his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.\\\\r\\\\nDo you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\naround,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPy Jingo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was Hans\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s contribution. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot mineself either.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s apprehensions\\\\r\\\\nwere realized. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlack\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had\\\\r\\\\nbeen picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton\\\\r\\\\nstepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a\\\\r\\\\ncorner, head on paws, watching his master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s every action. Burton struck\\\\r\\\\nout, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent\\\\r\\\\nspinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of\\\\r\\\\nthe bar.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThose who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a\\\\r\\\\nsomething which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body\\\\r\\\\nrise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s throat. The man\\\\r\\\\nsaved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled\\\\r\\\\nbackward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth\\\\r\\\\nfrom the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time\\\\r\\\\nthe man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn\\\\r\\\\nopen. Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a\\\\r\\\\nsurgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling\\\\r\\\\nfuriously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of\\\\r\\\\nhostile clubs. A \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cminers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 meeting,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d called on the spot, decided that\\\\r\\\\nthe dog had sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his\\\\r\\\\nreputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every\\\\r\\\\ncamp in Alaska.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLater on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life in\\\\r\\\\nquite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow\\\\r\\\\npoling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans\\\\r\\\\nand Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from\\\\r\\\\ntree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent\\\\r\\\\nby means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the\\\\r\\\\nbank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off\\\\r\\\\nhis master.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks\\\\r\\\\njutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton\\\\r\\\\npoled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in\\\\r\\\\nhis hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,\\\\r\\\\nand was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when\\\\r\\\\nHans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat\\\\r\\\\nflirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton,\\\\r\\\\nflung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of\\\\r\\\\nthe rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred\\\\r\\\\nyards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt\\\\r\\\\nhim grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his\\\\r\\\\nsplendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress\\\\r\\\\ndown-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where\\\\r\\\\nthe wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the\\\\r\\\\nrocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck\\\\r\\\\nof the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was\\\\r\\\\nfrightful, and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped\\\\r\\\\nfuriously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with\\\\r\\\\ncrushing force. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing\\\\r\\\\nBuck, and above the roar of the churning water shouted: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo, Buck! Go!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling\\\\r\\\\ndesperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s command\\\\r\\\\nrepeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as\\\\r\\\\nthough for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam\\\\r\\\\npowerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point\\\\r\\\\nwhere swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThey knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the\\\\r\\\\nface of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as\\\\r\\\\nfast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was\\\\r\\\\nhanging on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing\\\\r\\\\nthe boat to Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should\\\\r\\\\nneither strangle him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the\\\\r\\\\nstream. He struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream.\\\\r\\\\nHe discovered the mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him\\\\r\\\\nand a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried\\\\r\\\\nhelplessly past.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The\\\\r\\\\nrope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked\\\\r\\\\nunder the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body\\\\r\\\\nstruck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and\\\\r\\\\nHans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him\\\\r\\\\nand the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The\\\\r\\\\nfaint sound of Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice came to them, and though they could not\\\\r\\\\nmake out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His\\\\r\\\\nmaster\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his\\\\r\\\\nfeet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous\\\\r\\\\ndeparture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAgain the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck\\\\r\\\\nout, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once,\\\\r\\\\nbut he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,\\\\r\\\\npermitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on\\\\r\\\\ntill he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with\\\\r\\\\nthe speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him\\\\r\\\\ncoming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole\\\\r\\\\nforce of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both\\\\r\\\\narms around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and\\\\r\\\\nBuck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,\\\\r\\\\nsometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the\\\\r\\\\njagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the\\\\r\\\\nbank.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back and\\\\r\\\\nforth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for\\\\r\\\\nBuck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a\\\\r\\\\nhowl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton\\\\r\\\\nwas himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nbody, when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat settles it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he announced. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe camp right here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And camp they\\\\r\\\\ndid, till Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThat winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,\\\\r\\\\nperhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the\\\\r\\\\ntotem-pole of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to\\\\r\\\\nthe three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished,\\\\r\\\\nand were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East,\\\\r\\\\nwhere miners had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a\\\\r\\\\nconversation in the Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of\\\\r\\\\ntheir favorite dogs. Buck, because of his record, was the target for\\\\r\\\\nthese men, and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of\\\\r\\\\nhalf an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five\\\\r\\\\nhundred pounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for\\\\r\\\\nhis dog; and a third, seven hundred.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPooh! pooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Thornton; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBuck can start a thousand pounds.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d demanded\\\\r\\\\nMatthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d John\\\\r\\\\nThornton said coolly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could\\\\r\\\\nhear, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a thousand dollars that says he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. And there it\\\\r\\\\nis.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna\\\\r\\\\nsausage down upon the bar.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNobody spoke. Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He\\\\r\\\\ncould feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had\\\\r\\\\ntricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand\\\\r\\\\npounds. Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great\\\\r\\\\nfaith in Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s strength and had often thought him capable of starting\\\\r\\\\nsuch a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the\\\\r\\\\neyes of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had\\\\r\\\\nno thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of\\\\r\\\\nflour on it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Matthewson went on with brutal directness; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let\\\\r\\\\nthat hinder you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from\\\\r\\\\nface to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of\\\\r\\\\nthought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it\\\\r\\\\ngoing again. The face of Jim O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time\\\\r\\\\ncomrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him\\\\r\\\\nto do what he would never have dreamed of doing.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you lend me a thousand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, almost in a whisper.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSure,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d answered O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of\\\\r\\\\nMatthewson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThough it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s little faith I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m having, John, that the\\\\r\\\\nbeast can do the trick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The\\\\r\\\\ntables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see\\\\r\\\\nthe outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred\\\\r\\\\nand mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nsled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a\\\\r\\\\ncouple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the\\\\r\\\\nrunners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of\\\\r\\\\ntwo to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose\\\\r\\\\nconcerning the phrase \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbreak out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Brien contended it was Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\r\\\\nprivilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbreak it out\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nfrom a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included\\\\r\\\\nbreaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of\\\\r\\\\nthe men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,\\\\r\\\\nwhereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.\\\\r\\\\nThornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now\\\\r\\\\nthat he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular\\\\r\\\\nteam of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible\\\\r\\\\nthe task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree to one!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he proclaimed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lay you another thousand at that\\\\r\\\\nfigure, Thornton. What d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ye say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was\\\\r\\\\naroused\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize\\\\r\\\\nthe impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He\\\\r\\\\ncalled Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own\\\\r\\\\nthe three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the\\\\r\\\\nebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid\\\\r\\\\nit unhesitatingly against Matthewson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s six hundred.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was\\\\r\\\\nput into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and\\\\r\\\\nhe felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.\\\\r\\\\nMurmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in\\\\r\\\\nperfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one\\\\r\\\\nhundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit\\\\r\\\\nand virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the\\\\r\\\\nneck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half\\\\r\\\\nbristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of\\\\r\\\\nvigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and\\\\r\\\\nheavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the\\\\r\\\\nbody, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men\\\\r\\\\nfelt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went\\\\r\\\\ndown to two to one.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGad, sir! Gad, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king\\\\r\\\\nof the Skookum Benches. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before\\\\r\\\\nthe test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must stand off from him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Matthewson protested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFree play and\\\\r\\\\nplenty of room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers\\\\r\\\\nvainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent\\\\r\\\\nanimal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their\\\\r\\\\neyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton knelt down by Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side. He took his head in his two hands\\\\r\\\\nand rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his\\\\r\\\\nwont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs you\\\\r\\\\nlove me, Buck. As you love me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was what he whispered. Buck whined with\\\\r\\\\nsuppressed eagerness.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It\\\\r\\\\nseemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his\\\\r\\\\nmittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and\\\\r\\\\nreleasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of\\\\r\\\\nspeech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Buck,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several\\\\r\\\\ninches. It was the way he had learned.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGee!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up\\\\r\\\\nthe slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty\\\\r\\\\npounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp\\\\r\\\\ncrackling.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaw!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Thornton commanded.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck duplicated the man\\\\xc5\\\\x93uvre, this time to the left. The crackling\\\\r\\\\nturned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and\\\\r\\\\ngrating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were\\\\r\\\\nholding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, MUSH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself\\\\r\\\\nforward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was\\\\r\\\\ngathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles\\\\r\\\\nwrithing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great\\\\r\\\\nchest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet\\\\r\\\\nwere flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in\\\\r\\\\nparallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.\\\\r\\\\nOne of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled\\\\r\\\\nlurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it\\\\r\\\\nnever really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two\\\\r\\\\ninches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained\\\\r\\\\nmomentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they\\\\r\\\\nhad ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck\\\\r\\\\nwith short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he\\\\r\\\\nneared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,\\\\r\\\\na cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed\\\\r\\\\nthe firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself\\\\r\\\\nloose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men\\\\r\\\\nwere shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a\\\\r\\\\ngeneral incoherent babel.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and\\\\r\\\\nhe was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him\\\\r\\\\ncursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and\\\\r\\\\nlovingly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGad, sir! Gad, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d spluttered the Skookum Bench king. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll give you\\\\r\\\\na thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94twelve hundred, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming\\\\r\\\\nfrankly down his cheeks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said to the Skookum Bench king, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cno,\\\\r\\\\nsir. You can go to hell, sir. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best I can do for you, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck seized Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and\\\\r\\\\nforth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back\\\\r\\\\nto a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to\\\\r\\\\ninterrupt.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nChapter VII. The Sounding of the Call\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John\\\\r\\\\nThornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts\\\\r\\\\nand to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost\\\\r\\\\nmine, the history of which was as old as the history of the country.\\\\r\\\\nMany men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there\\\\r\\\\nwere who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped\\\\r\\\\nin tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The\\\\r\\\\noldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning\\\\r\\\\nthere had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to\\\\r\\\\nit, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their\\\\r\\\\ntestimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the\\\\r\\\\nNorthland.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were\\\\r\\\\ndead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a\\\\r\\\\ndozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve\\\\r\\\\nwhere men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded\\\\r\\\\nseventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,\\\\r\\\\npassed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart\\\\r\\\\nitself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked\\\\r\\\\nthe backbone of the continent.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJohn Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the\\\\r\\\\nwild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the\\\\r\\\\nwilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.\\\\r\\\\nBeing in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course\\\\r\\\\nof the day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he\\\\r\\\\nkept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he\\\\r\\\\nwould come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight\\\\r\\\\nmeat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the\\\\r\\\\nload on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless\\\\r\\\\nfuture.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite\\\\r\\\\nwandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold\\\\r\\\\non steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp,\\\\r\\\\nhere and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through\\\\r\\\\nfrozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat\\\\r\\\\nof the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted\\\\r\\\\nriotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of\\\\r\\\\nhunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted\\\\r\\\\nacross blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in\\\\r\\\\nslender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the\\\\r\\\\nuncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the\\\\r\\\\nLost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,\\\\r\\\\nshivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber\\\\r\\\\nline and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming\\\\r\\\\ngnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and\\\\r\\\\nflowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall\\\\r\\\\nof the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where\\\\r\\\\nwildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of\\\\r\\\\nlife\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered\\\\r\\\\nplaces, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of\\\\r\\\\nmen who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the\\\\r\\\\nforest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the\\\\r\\\\npath began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the\\\\r\\\\nman who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another\\\\r\\\\ntime they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and\\\\r\\\\namid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled\\\\r\\\\nflint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days\\\\r\\\\nin the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins\\\\r\\\\npacked flat, And that was all\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94no hint as to the man who in an early day\\\\r\\\\nhad reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSpring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they\\\\r\\\\nfound, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where\\\\r\\\\nthe gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the\\\\r\\\\nwashing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them\\\\r\\\\nthousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every\\\\r\\\\nday. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag,\\\\r\\\\nand piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like\\\\r\\\\ngiants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as\\\\r\\\\nthey heaped the treasure up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now\\\\r\\\\nand again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the\\\\r\\\\nfire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more\\\\r\\\\nfrequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,\\\\r\\\\nblinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which\\\\r\\\\nhe remembered.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the\\\\r\\\\nhairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands\\\\r\\\\nclasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and\\\\r\\\\nawakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness\\\\r\\\\nand fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,\\\\r\\\\nwhere the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it\\\\r\\\\nwas with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs\\\\r\\\\nprepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the\\\\r\\\\nforest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heels; and they\\\\r\\\\nwere alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving\\\\r\\\\nand nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as\\\\r\\\\nBuck. The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as\\\\r\\\\nfast as on the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb,\\\\r\\\\nsometimes a dozen feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling,\\\\r\\\\nnever missing his grip. In fact, he seemed as much at home among the\\\\r\\\\ntrees as on the ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent\\\\r\\\\nbeneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he\\\\r\\\\nslept.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still\\\\r\\\\nsounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest\\\\r\\\\nand strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and\\\\r\\\\nhe was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.\\\\r\\\\nSometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though\\\\r\\\\nit were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood\\\\r\\\\nmight dictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or\\\\r\\\\ninto the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the\\\\r\\\\nfat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment,\\\\r\\\\nbehind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared\\\\r\\\\nto all that moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that\\\\r\\\\nhe hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not\\\\r\\\\nknow why he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and\\\\r\\\\ndid not reason about them at all.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIrresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing\\\\r\\\\nlazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and\\\\r\\\\nhis ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet\\\\r\\\\nand dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and\\\\r\\\\nacross the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run\\\\r\\\\ndown dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the\\\\r\\\\nwoods. For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he\\\\r\\\\ncould watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But\\\\r\\\\nespecially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights,\\\\r\\\\nlistening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading\\\\r\\\\nsigns and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious\\\\r\\\\nsomething that called\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him\\\\r\\\\nto come.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOne night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils\\\\r\\\\nquivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the\\\\r\\\\nforest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),\\\\r\\\\ndistinct and definite as never before,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a long-drawn howl, like, yet\\\\r\\\\nunlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old\\\\r\\\\nfamiliar way, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping\\\\r\\\\ncamp and in swift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer\\\\r\\\\nto the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he\\\\r\\\\ncame to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on\\\\r\\\\nhaunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense\\\\r\\\\nhis presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered\\\\r\\\\ncompactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted\\\\r\\\\ncare. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of\\\\r\\\\nfriendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild\\\\r\\\\nbeasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with\\\\r\\\\nwild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind\\\\r\\\\nchannel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The\\\\r\\\\nwolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe\\\\r\\\\nand of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his\\\\r\\\\nteeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBuck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with\\\\r\\\\nfriendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made\\\\r\\\\nthree of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulder.\\\\r\\\\nWatching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time\\\\r\\\\nand again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in\\\\r\\\\npoor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He\\\\r\\\\nwould run till Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl\\\\r\\\\naround at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut in the end Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding\\\\r\\\\nthat no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they\\\\r\\\\nbecame friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with\\\\r\\\\nwhich fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the\\\\r\\\\nwolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was\\\\r\\\\ngoing somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they\\\\r\\\\nran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek\\\\r\\\\nbed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide\\\\r\\\\nwhere it took its rise.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level\\\\r\\\\ncountry where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and\\\\r\\\\nthrough these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the\\\\r\\\\nsun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He\\\\r\\\\nknew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood\\\\r\\\\nbrother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories\\\\r\\\\nwere coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he\\\\r\\\\nstirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done\\\\r\\\\nthis thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,\\\\r\\\\nand he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked\\\\r\\\\nearth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThey stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck\\\\r\\\\nremembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the\\\\r\\\\nplace from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing\\\\r\\\\nnoses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned\\\\r\\\\nabout and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an\\\\r\\\\nhour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat\\\\r\\\\ndown, pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and\\\\r\\\\nas Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter\\\\r\\\\nuntil it was lost in the distance.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJohn Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang\\\\r\\\\nupon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon\\\\r\\\\nhim, licking his face, biting his hand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cplaying the general tom-fool,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\r\\\\nas John Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and\\\\r\\\\nforth and cursed him lovingly.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of\\\\r\\\\nhis sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,\\\\r\\\\nsaw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But\\\\r\\\\nafter two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously\\\\r\\\\nthan ever. Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by\\\\r\\\\nrecollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the\\\\r\\\\ndivide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once\\\\r\\\\nagain he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no\\\\r\\\\nmore; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was\\\\r\\\\nnever raised.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHe began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a\\\\r\\\\ntime; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went\\\\r\\\\ndown into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a week,\\\\r\\\\nseeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as\\\\r\\\\nhe travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never\\\\r\\\\nto tire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere\\\\r\\\\ninto the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded\\\\r\\\\nby the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest\\\\r\\\\nhelpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the\\\\r\\\\nlast latent remnants of Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ferocity. And two days later, when he\\\\r\\\\nreturned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the\\\\r\\\\nspoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two\\\\r\\\\nbehind who would quarrel no more.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a\\\\r\\\\nthing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by\\\\r\\\\nvirtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a\\\\r\\\\nhostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this\\\\r\\\\nhe became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated\\\\r\\\\nitself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself in\\\\r\\\\nall his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke\\\\r\\\\nplainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious\\\\r\\\\nfurry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his\\\\r\\\\nmuzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran\\\\r\\\\nmidmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic\\\\r\\\\nwolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father\\\\r\\\\nhe had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who\\\\r\\\\nhad given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf\\\\r\\\\nmuzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his\\\\r\\\\nhead, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHis cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,\\\\r\\\\nshepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus\\\\r\\\\nan experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable\\\\r\\\\na creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous animal living on\\\\r\\\\na straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his\\\\r\\\\nlife, overspilling with vigor and virility. When Thornton passed a\\\\r\\\\ncaressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the\\\\r\\\\nhand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. Every\\\\r\\\\npart, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most\\\\r\\\\nexquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect\\\\r\\\\nequilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which\\\\r\\\\nrequired action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as\\\\r\\\\na husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could\\\\r\\\\nleap twice as quickly. He saw the movement, or heard sound, and\\\\r\\\\nresponded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere\\\\r\\\\nseeing or hearing. He perceived and determined and responded in the\\\\r\\\\nsame instant. In point of fact the three actions of perceiving,\\\\r\\\\ndetermining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were\\\\r\\\\nthe intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His\\\\r\\\\nmuscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply,\\\\r\\\\nlike steel springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad\\\\r\\\\nand rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer\\\\r\\\\necstasy and pour forth generously over the world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever was there such a dog,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said John Thornton one day, as the\\\\r\\\\npartners watched Buck marching out of camp.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen he was made, the mould was broke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Pete.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPy jingo! I t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ink so mineself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hans affirmed.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThey saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and\\\\r\\\\nterrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the\\\\r\\\\nsecrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing\\\\r\\\\nof the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that\\\\r\\\\nappeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take\\\\r\\\\nadvantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like\\\\r\\\\na snake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest,\\\\r\\\\nkill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks\\\\r\\\\nfleeing a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not\\\\r\\\\ntoo quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He\\\\r\\\\nkilled to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he\\\\r\\\\nkilled himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was\\\\r\\\\nhis delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them,\\\\r\\\\nto let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater\\\\r\\\\nabundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less\\\\r\\\\nrigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown\\\\r\\\\ncalf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and\\\\r\\\\nhe came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band\\\\r\\\\nof twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,\\\\r\\\\nand chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and,\\\\r\\\\nstanding over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist\\\\r\\\\nas even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great\\\\r\\\\npalmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet\\\\r\\\\nwithin the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,\\\\r\\\\nwhile he roared with fury at sight of Buck.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom the bull\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered\\\\r\\\\narrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct\\\\r\\\\nwhich came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck\\\\r\\\\nproceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He\\\\r\\\\nwould bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of\\\\r\\\\nthe great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have\\\\r\\\\nstamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the\\\\r\\\\nfanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of\\\\r\\\\nrage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring\\\\r\\\\nhim on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus\\\\r\\\\nseparated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would\\\\r\\\\ncharge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThere is a patience of the wild\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94dogged, tireless, persistent as life\\\\r\\\\nitself\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,\\\\r\\\\nthe snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience\\\\r\\\\nbelongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it\\\\r\\\\nbelonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its\\\\r\\\\nmarch, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their\\\\r\\\\nhalf-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.\\\\r\\\\nFor half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from\\\\r\\\\nall sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out\\\\r\\\\nhis victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the\\\\r\\\\npatience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that\\\\r\\\\nof creatures preying.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest\\\\r\\\\n(the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),\\\\r\\\\nthe young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the\\\\r\\\\naid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them on\\\\r\\\\nto the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this\\\\r\\\\ntireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of\\\\r\\\\nthe herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only\\\\r\\\\none member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,\\\\r\\\\nand in the end they were content to pay the toll.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his\\\\r\\\\nmates\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he\\\\r\\\\nhad mastered\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading\\\\r\\\\nlight. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless\\\\r\\\\nfanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than\\\\r\\\\nhalf a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight\\\\r\\\\nand struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature\\\\r\\\\nwhose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFrom then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a\\\\r\\\\nmoment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the\\\\r\\\\nshoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull\\\\r\\\\nopportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling\\\\r\\\\nstreams they crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long\\\\r\\\\nstretches of flight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him,\\\\r\\\\nbut loped easily at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was\\\\r\\\\nplayed, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely\\\\r\\\\nwhen he strove to eat or drink.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the\\\\r\\\\nshambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long\\\\r\\\\nperiods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and\\\\r\\\\nBuck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to\\\\r\\\\nrest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes\\\\r\\\\nfixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming\\\\r\\\\nover the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the\\\\r\\\\nmoose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.\\\\r\\\\nForest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The\\\\r\\\\nnews of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but\\\\r\\\\nby some other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet\\\\r\\\\nknew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange\\\\r\\\\nthings were afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he\\\\r\\\\nhad finished the business in hand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAt last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.\\\\r\\\\nFor a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping,\\\\r\\\\nturn and turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his\\\\r\\\\nface toward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope,\\\\r\\\\nand went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way,\\\\r\\\\nheading straight home through strange country with a certitude of\\\\r\\\\ndirection that put man and his magnetic needle to shame.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the\\\\r\\\\nland. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had\\\\r\\\\nbeen there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon\\\\r\\\\nhim in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the\\\\r\\\\nsquirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several\\\\r\\\\ntimes he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs,\\\\r\\\\nreading a message which made him leap on with greater speed. He was\\\\r\\\\noppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity\\\\r\\\\nalready happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down\\\\r\\\\ninto the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThree miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair\\\\r\\\\nrippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.\\\\r\\\\nBuck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and\\\\r\\\\ntense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94all but\\\\r\\\\nthe end. His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the\\\\r\\\\nlife on the heels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant\\\\r\\\\nsilence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in\\\\r\\\\nhiding. One only he saw,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray\\\\r\\\\ndead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the\\\\r\\\\nwood itself.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose\\\\r\\\\nwas jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped\\\\r\\\\nand pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.\\\\r\\\\nHe was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow\\\\r\\\\nprotruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs\\\\r\\\\nThornton had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a\\\\r\\\\ndeath-struggle, directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him\\\\r\\\\nwithout stopping. From the camp came the faint sound of many voices,\\\\r\\\\nrising and falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge\\\\r\\\\nof the clearing, he found Hans, lying on his face, feathered with\\\\r\\\\narrows like a porcupine. At the same instant Buck peered out where the\\\\r\\\\nspruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up\\\\r\\\\non his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him.\\\\r\\\\nHe did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible\\\\r\\\\nferocity. For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp\\\\r\\\\ncunning and reason, and it was because of his great love for John\\\\r\\\\nThornton that he lost his head.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge\\\\r\\\\nwhen they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal\\\\r\\\\nthe like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live\\\\r\\\\nhurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He\\\\r\\\\nsprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping\\\\r\\\\nthe throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.\\\\r\\\\nHe did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the\\\\r\\\\nnext bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was no\\\\r\\\\nwithstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,\\\\r\\\\nrending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the\\\\r\\\\narrows they discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his\\\\r\\\\nmovements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they\\\\r\\\\nshot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear\\\\r\\\\nat Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with\\\\r\\\\nsuch force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood\\\\r\\\\nout beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to\\\\r\\\\nthe woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and\\\\r\\\\ndragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was a\\\\r\\\\nfateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the\\\\r\\\\ncountry, and it was not till a week later that the last of the\\\\r\\\\nsurvivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.\\\\r\\\\nAs for Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated\\\\r\\\\ncamp. He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the\\\\r\\\\nfirst moment of surprise. Thornton\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s desperate struggle was\\\\r\\\\nfresh-written on the earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to\\\\r\\\\nthe edge of a deep pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water,\\\\r\\\\nlay Skeet, faithful to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored\\\\r\\\\nfrom the sluice boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it\\\\r\\\\ncontained John Thornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water,\\\\r\\\\nfrom which no trace led away.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.\\\\r\\\\nDeath, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the\\\\r\\\\nlives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It\\\\r\\\\nleft a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which\\\\r\\\\nached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he\\\\r\\\\npaused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain\\\\r\\\\nof it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a\\\\r\\\\npride greater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the\\\\r\\\\nnoblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club\\\\r\\\\nand fang. He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It\\\\r\\\\nwas harder to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all,\\\\r\\\\nwere it not for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he\\\\r\\\\nwould be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their\\\\r\\\\narrows, spears, and clubs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNight came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,\\\\r\\\\nlighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the\\\\r\\\\ncoming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became\\\\r\\\\nalive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which\\\\r\\\\nthe Yeehats had made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far\\\\r\\\\naway drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp\\\\r\\\\nyelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again\\\\r\\\\nBuck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in\\\\r\\\\nhis memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It\\\\r\\\\nwas the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and\\\\r\\\\ncompellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to\\\\r\\\\nobey. John Thornton was dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the\\\\r\\\\nclaims of man no longer bound him.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the\\\\r\\\\nflanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over\\\\r\\\\nfrom the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s valley. Into the\\\\r\\\\nclearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood;\\\\r\\\\nand in the centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue,\\\\r\\\\nwaiting their coming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and\\\\r\\\\na moment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him.\\\\r\\\\nLike a flash Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without\\\\r\\\\nmovement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.\\\\r\\\\nThree others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they\\\\r\\\\ndrew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded\\\\r\\\\ntogether, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.\\\\r\\\\nBuck\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.\\\\r\\\\nPivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere\\\\r\\\\nat once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly\\\\r\\\\ndid he whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from\\\\r\\\\ngetting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the\\\\r\\\\ncreek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He worked\\\\r\\\\nalong to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course\\\\r\\\\nof mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides\\\\r\\\\nand with nothing to do but face the front.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves\\\\r\\\\ndrew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the\\\\r\\\\nwhite fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying\\\\r\\\\ndown with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their\\\\r\\\\nfeet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool.\\\\r\\\\nOne wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly\\\\r\\\\nmanner, and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a\\\\r\\\\nnight and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they\\\\r\\\\ntouched noses.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThen an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed\\\\r\\\\nhis lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,\\\\r\\\\nWhereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke\\\\r\\\\nout the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the\\\\r\\\\ncall came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down and\\\\r\\\\nhowled. This over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around\\\\r\\\\nhim, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted\\\\r\\\\nthe yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung\\\\r\\\\nin behind, yelping in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with\\\\r\\\\nthe wild brother, yelping as he ran.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when\\\\r\\\\nthe Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were\\\\r\\\\nseen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of\\\\r\\\\nwhite centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the\\\\r\\\\nYeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are\\\\r\\\\nafraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they,\\\\r\\\\nstealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps,\\\\r\\\\nslaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the\\\\r\\\\ncamp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with\\\\r\\\\nthroats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the\\\\r\\\\nsnow greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats\\\\r\\\\nfollow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they\\\\r\\\\nnever enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over\\\\r\\\\nthe fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an\\\\r\\\\nabiding-place.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which\\\\r\\\\nthe Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,\\\\r\\\\nand yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling\\\\r\\\\ntimber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a\\\\r\\\\nyellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the\\\\r\\\\nground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould\\\\r\\\\noverrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses\\\\r\\\\nfor a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the\\\\r\\\\nwolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running\\\\r\\\\nat the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering\\\\r\\\\nborealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow\\\\r\\\\nas he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Call of the Wild, by Jack London\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n'"

Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow  metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming  the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men  wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong  muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the  frost.    Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge  Miller\\'s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden  among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide  cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached  by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns  and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things  were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great  stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad  servants\\' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long  grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there  was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank  where Judge Miller\\'s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in  the hot afternoon.    And over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he  had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other  dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they  did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or  lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of  Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,-strange  creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On  the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least,  who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the  windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with  brooms and mops.    But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.  He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge\\'s  sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge\\'s daughters, on long  twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the  Judge\\'s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge\\'s  grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their  footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable  yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.  Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he  utterly ignored, for he was king,-king over all creeping, crawling,  flying things of Judge Miller\\'s place, humans included.    His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge\\'s inseparable  companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was  not so large,-he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,-for his  mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred  and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good  living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right  royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived  the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was  even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become  because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not  becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor  delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as  to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a  health preserver.    And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the  Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.  But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel,  one of the gardener\\'s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel  had one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his  gambling, he had one besetting weakness-faith in a system; and this  made his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while  the wages of a gardener\\'s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife  and numerous progeny.    The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers\\' Association, and the  boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of  Manuel\\'s treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard  on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a  solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known  as College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between  them.    \"You might wrap up the goods before you deliver \\'m,\" the stranger said  gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck\\'s neck  under the collar.    \"Twist it, an\\' you\\'ll choke \\'m plentee,\" said Manuel, and the stranger  grunted a ready affirmative.    Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an  unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and  to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the  ends of the rope were placed in the stranger\\'s hands, he growled  menacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride  believing that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope  tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he  sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the  throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope  tightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue  lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in  all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life  had he been so angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he  knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into  the baggage car.    The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and  that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse  shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He  had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of  riding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the  unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but  Buck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they  relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.    \"Yep, has fits,\" the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the  baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. \"I\\'m  takin\\' \\'m up for the boss to \\'Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks  that he can cure \\'m.\"    Concerning that night\\'s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for  himself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water  front.    \"All I get is fifty for it,\" he grumbled; \"an\\' I wouldn\\'t do it over  for a thousand, cold cash.\"    His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser  leg was ripped from knee to ankle.    \"How much did the other mug get?\" the saloon-keeper demanded.    \"A hundred,\" was the reply. \"Wouldn\\'t take a sou less, so help me.\"    \"That makes a hundred and fifty,\" the saloon-keeper calculated; \"and  he\\'s worth it, or I\\'m a squarehead.\"    The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated  hand. \"If I don\\'t get the hydrophoby-\"    \"It\\'ll be because you was born to hang,\" laughed the saloon-keeper.  \"Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,\" he added.    Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life  half throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But  he was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing  the heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed,  and he was flung into a cagelike crate.    There he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath  and wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did  they want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent  up in this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by  the vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night  he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see  the Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face  of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a  tallow candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck\\'s  throat was twisted into a savage growl.    But the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men  entered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for  they were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed  and raged at them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks  at him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that  that was what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed  the crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he  was imprisoned, began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the  express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another  wagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels,  upon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great  railway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.    For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail  of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate  nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express  messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he  flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at  him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs,  mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he  knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger  waxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of  water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch.  For that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment  had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his  parched and swollen throat and tongue.    He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given  them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.  They would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was  resolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during  those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath  that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned  blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed  was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the  express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the  train at Seattle.    Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,  high-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged  generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.  That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled  himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a  hatchet and a club.    \"You ain\\'t going to take him out now?\" the driver asked.    \"Sure,\" the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.    There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried  it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the  performance.    Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging  and wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was  there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get  out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.    \"Now, you red-eyed devil,\" he said, when he had made an opening  sufficient for the passage of Buck\\'s body. At the same time he dropped  the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.    And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for  the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his  blood-shot eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and  forty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and  nights. In mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he  received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together  with an agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his  back and side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did  not understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was  again on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came  and he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware  that it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he  charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.    After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to  rush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth  and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.  Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on  the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the  exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its  ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the  club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the  same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete  circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on  his head and chest.    For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had  purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,  knocked utterly senseless.    \"He\\'s no slouch at dog-breakin\\', that\\'s wot I say,\" one of the men on  the wall cried enthusiastically.    \"Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,\" was the reply of  the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.    Buck\\'s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he  had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.    \"\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Answers to the name of Buck,\\'\" the man soliloquized, quoting from the  saloon-keeper\\'s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate  and contents. \"Well, Buck, my boy,\" he went on in a genial voice,  \"we\\'ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let  it go at that. You\\'ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good  dog and all \\'ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I\\'ll  whale the stuffin\\' outa you. Understand?\"    As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly  pounded, and though Buck\\'s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the  hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he  drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by  chunk, from the man\\'s hand.    He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for  all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned  the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was  a revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,  and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a  fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it  with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by,  other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and  some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched  them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and  again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven  home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed,  though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty,  though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged  their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would  neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for  mastery.    Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,  and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such  times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of  the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never  came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was  glad each time when he was not selected.    Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who  spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which  Buck could not understand.    \"Sacredam!\" he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. \"Dat one dam bully  dog! Eh? How moch?\"    \"Three hundred, and a present at that,\" was the prompt reply of the man  in the red sweater. \"And seem\\' it\\'s government money, you ain\\'t got no  kick coming, eh, Perrault?\"    Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed  skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an  animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its  despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at  Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand-\"One in ten t\\'ousand,\" he  commented mentally.    Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a  good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened  man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as  Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the _Narwhal_,  it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken  below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was  a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new  kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and  while he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew  honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice,  and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.    In the \\'tween-decks of the _Narwhal_, Buck and Curly joined two other  dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had  been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a  Geological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous  sort of way, smiling into one\\'s face the while he meditated some  underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck\\'s food at  the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s  whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing  remained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, he  decided, and the half-breed began his rise in Buck\\'s estimation.    The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not  attempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow,  and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone,  and further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone.  \"Dave\" he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times,  and took interest in nothing, not even when the _Narwhal_ crossed Queen  Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing  possessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he  raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious  glance, yawned, and went to sleep again.    Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,  and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that  the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the  propeller was quiet, and the _Narwhal_ was pervaded with an atmosphere  of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a  change was at hand. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois leashed them and brought them on deck. At  the first step upon the cold surface, Buck\\'s feet sank into a white  mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of  this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but  more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up  on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This  puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers  laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was  his first snow.        Chapter II. The Law of Club and Fang    Buck\\'s first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was  filled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the  heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. No  lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be  bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment\\'s safety. All was  confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.  There was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and  men were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who  knew no law but the law of club and fang.    He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his  first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was  a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.  Curly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she,  in her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a  full-grown wolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning,  only a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out  equally swift, and Curly\\'s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.    It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there  was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and  surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not  comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they  were licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again  and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar  fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This  was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her,  snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath  the bristling mass of bodies.    So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw  Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he  saw Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men  with clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two  minutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were  clubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody,  trampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed  standing over her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to  Buck to trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play.  Once down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he  never went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from  that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.    Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of  Curly, he received another shock. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois fastened upon him an  arrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had  seen the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses  work, so he was set to work, hauling Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois on a sled to the forest  that fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though  his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was  too wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though  it was all new and strange. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was stern, demanding instant  obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while  Dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck\\'s hind quarters  whenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,  and while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now  and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck  into the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined  tuition of his two mates and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois made remarkable progress. Ere  they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at \"ho,\" to go ahead at  \"mush,\" to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler  when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.    \"T\\'ree vair\\' good dogs,\" Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois told Perrault. \"Dat Buck, heem pool  lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt\\'ing.\"    By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his  despatches, returned with two more dogs. \"Billee\" and \"Joe\" he called  them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother  though they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee\\'s one  fault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite,  sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.  Buck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz  proceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his  tail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no  avail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz\\'s sharp teeth scored  his flank. But no matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his  heels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and  snarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes  diabolically gleaming-the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible  was his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him;  but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and  wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.    By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean  and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a  warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks,  which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing,  expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into  their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which  Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached  on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the  first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled  upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and  down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of  their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like  Dave\\'s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn,  each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.    That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent,  illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain;  and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he  recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer  cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with  especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and  attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet.  Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents,  only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there  savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled  (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.    Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own  team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared.  Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and  again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else  he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be?  With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he  aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore  legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang  back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a  friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A  whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under  the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed  and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured,  as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck\\'s face with his warm wet tongue.    Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently  selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a  hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined  space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he  slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and  wrestled with bad dreams.    Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.  At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night  and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side,  and a great surge of fear swept through him-the fear of the wild thing  for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own  life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an  unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so  could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted  spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders  stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into  the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he  landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and  knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he  went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the  night before.    A shout from Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois hailed his appearance. \"Wot I say?\" the  dog-driver cried to Perrault. \"Dat Buck for sure learn queek as  anyt\\'ing.\"    Perrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government,  bearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs,  and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.    Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a  total of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they  were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Ca\\\\xc3\\\\xb1on. Buck  was glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not  particularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which  animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still  more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were  new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and  unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious  that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by  delay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed  the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and  the only thing in which they took delight.    Dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then  came Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,  to the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.    Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he  might receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally  apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing  their teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He  never nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he  stood in need of it. As Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s whip backed him up, Buck found it to  be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief  halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both  Dave and Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The  resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the  traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he  mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s whip  snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up  his feet and carefully examining them.    It was a hard day\\'s run, up the Ca\\\\xc3\\\\xb1on, through Sheep Camp, past the  Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of  feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the  salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely  North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the  craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge  camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were  building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made  his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all  too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his  mates to the sled.    That day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next  day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked  harder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of  the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for  them. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged  places with him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided  himself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for  the fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was  no ice at all.    Day after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,  they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them  hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always  they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to  sleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of  sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go  nowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.  Yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the  life, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good  condition.    He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old  life. A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed  him of his unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was  fighting off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the  others. To remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did  hunger compel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him.  He watched and learned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever  malingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault\\'s back  was turned, he duplicated the performance the following day, getting  away with the whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was  unsuspected; while Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting  caught, was punished for Buck\\'s misdeed.    This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland  environment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself  to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and  terrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his  moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for  existence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of  love and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;  but in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such  things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he  would fail to prosper.    Not that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and  unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his  days, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But the  club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more  fundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a  moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller\\'s riding-whip; but  the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability  to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.  He did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his  stomach. He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out  of respect for club and fang. In short, the things he did were done  because it was easier to do them than not to do them.    His development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard  as iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an  internal as well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter  how loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his  stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood  carried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the  toughest and stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably  keen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he  heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril.  He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between  his toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice  over the water hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with  stiff fore legs. His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the  wind and forecast it a night in advance. No matter how breathless the  air when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew  inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.    And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became  alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways  he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs  ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as  they ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and  slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten  ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks  which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.  They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been  his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at  a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and  dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and  through him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which  voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and  the cold, and dark.    Thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged  through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had  found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener\\'s  helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers  small copies of himself.        Chapter III. The Dominant Primordial Beast    The dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce  conditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.  His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy  adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he  not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A certain  deliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to rashness  and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz  he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.    On the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous  rival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even  went out of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the  fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in  the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted  accident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp  on the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a  white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping  place. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a  perpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois were compelled to  make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake  itself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light. A  few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down  through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.    Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm  was it, that he was loath to leave it when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois distributed the  fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished  his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl  told him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided  trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared.  He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz  particularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him  that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own  only because of his great weight and size.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the  disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. \"A-a-ah!\" he  cried to Buck. \"Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty  t\\'eef!\"    Spitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness  as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no  less eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth  for the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the  thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future,  past many a weary mile of trail and toil.    An oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony  frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of  pandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking  furry forms,-starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had  scented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck  and Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with  stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed  by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the  grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box  was capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished  brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon  them unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but  struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.    In the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests  only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such  dogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.  They were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with  blazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them  terrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs  were swept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by  three huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and  slashed. The din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and  Sol-leks, dripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely  side by side. Joe was snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on  the fore leg of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike,  the malingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with  a quick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the  throat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the  jugular. The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater  fierceness. He flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt  teeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking  from the side.    Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,  hurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts  rolled back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only  for a moment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub,  upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee,  terrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away  over the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the  team behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of  the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident  intention of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of  huskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock  of Spitz\\'s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.    Later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the  forest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not  one who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded  grievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky  added to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an  eye; while Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to  ribbons, cried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they  limped warily back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men  in bad tempers. Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had  chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact,  nothing, no matter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had  eaten a pair of Perrault\\'s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the  leather traces, and even two feet of lash from the end of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s  whip. He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his  wounded dogs.    \"Ah, my frien\\'s,\" he said softly, \"mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many  bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t\\'ink, eh, Perrault?\"    The courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail  still between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break  out among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses  into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling  painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,  and for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.    The Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,  and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held  at all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty  terrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was  accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,  Perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by  the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time  across the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the  thermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke  through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his  garments.    Nothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had  been chosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks,  resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and  struggling on from dim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on  rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not  halt. Once, the sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were  half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The  usual fire was necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with  ice, and the two men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and  thawing, so close that they were singed by the flames.    At another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him  up to Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws  on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But  behind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled  was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, pulling till his tendons cracked.    Again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no  escape except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled  lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs  were hoisted, one by one, to the cliff crest. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois came up last,  after the sled and load. Then came the search for a place to descend,  which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night  found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day\\'s  credit.    By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played  out. The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make  up lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they covered  thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to  the Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well  up toward the Five Fingers.    Buck\\'s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.  His had softened during the many generations since the day his last  wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he  limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry  as he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois had to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck\\'s feet  for half an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of  his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great  relief, and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist  itself into a grin one morning, when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois forgot the moccasins and  Buck lay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and  refused to budge without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail,  and the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away.    At the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had  never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced  her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog  bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a  dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew  that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away  he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could  she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so  great was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the  island, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with  rough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the  main river, and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time,  though he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap  behind. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled  back, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all  his faith in that Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois would save him. The dog-driver held the axe  poised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon  mad Dolly\\'s head.    Buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,  helpless. This was Spitz\\'s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice  his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh  to the bone. Then Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s lash descended, and Buck had the  satisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet  administered to any of the teams.    \"One devil, dat Spitz,\" remarked Perrault. \"Some dam day heem keel dat  Buck.\"    \"Dat Buck two devils,\" was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s rejoinder. \"All de tam I watch  dat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak  hell an\\' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an\\' spit heem out on de snow.  Sure. I know.\"    From then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and  acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this  strange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many  Southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and  on trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and  starvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered,  matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a  masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club  of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness  out of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could  bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.    It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck  wanted it. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been  gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and  trace-that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which  lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if  they are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as  wheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride  that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour  and sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride  that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at  night, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This  was the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who  blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in  the morning. Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a  possible lead-dog. And this was Buck\\'s pride, too.    He openly threatened the other\\'s leadership. He came between him and  the shirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One  night there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the  malingerer, did not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a  foot of snow. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was  wild with wrath. He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in  every likely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and  shivered in his hiding-place.    But when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him,  Buck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so  shrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.  Pike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,  and sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a  forgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, chuckling at  the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought  his lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck  from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into  play. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash  laid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many  times offending Pike.    In the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still  continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it  craftily, when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,  a general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks  were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.  Things no longer went right. There was continual bickering and  jangling. Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck.  He kept Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension  of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take  place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of  quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his  sleeping robe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.    But the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson  one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many  men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the  ordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up  and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling  bells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up  to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa  Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main  they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine,  at twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie  chant, in which it was Buck\\'s delight to join.    With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping  in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of  snow, this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life,  only it was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and  half-sobs, and was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of  existence. It was an old song, old as the breed itself-one of the first  songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was  invested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which  Buck was so strangely stirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with  the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and  the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and  mystery. And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness  with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw  beginnings of life in the howling ages.    Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the  steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and  Salt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent  than those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,  and he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things  favored him in this. The week\\'s rest had recuperated the dogs and put  them in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was  packed hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged  in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was  travelling light.    They made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and  the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to  Pelly. But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble  and vexation on the part of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois. The insidious revolt led by Buck  had destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog  leaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them  into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader  greatly to be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to  challenging his authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night,  and gulped it down under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and  Joe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. And  even Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not  half so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz  without snarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct  approached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down  before Spitz\\'s very nose.    The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their  relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever  among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and  Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the  unending squabbling. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois swore strange barbarous oaths, and  stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always  singing among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back  was turned they were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip,  while Buck backed up the remainder of the team. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois knew he was  behind all the trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever  ever again to be caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the  harness, for the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater  delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the  traces.    At the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a  snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team  was in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest  Police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit  sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed  of which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow,  while the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack,  sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay  down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing  forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap,  like some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.    All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men  out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by  chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to  kill-all this was Buck\\'s, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was  ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the  living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes  in warm blood.    There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which  life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes  when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that  one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the  artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to  the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it  came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining  after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through  the moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the  parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb  of Time. He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave  of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in  that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and  rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the  stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.    But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the  pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long  bend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the  frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and  larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate  path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the  white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a  stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging  down from Life\\'s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck\\'s  heels raised a hell\\'s chorus of delight.    Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon  Spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They  rolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost  as though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder  and leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel  jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and  lifting lips that writhed and snarled.    In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As  they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the  advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He  seemed to remember it all,-the white woods, and earth, and moonlight,  and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a  ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air-nothing moved,  not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and  lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe  rabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn  up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only  gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was  nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had  always been, the wonted way of things.    Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and  across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of  dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never  blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his  enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he  was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first  defended that attack.    In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.  Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by  the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,  but Buck could not penetrate his enemy\\'s guard. Then he warmed up and  enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried  for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and  each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took  to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his  head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the  shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead,  Buck\\'s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly  away.    Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting  hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and  wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck  grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for  footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs  started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle  sank down again and waited.    But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness-imagination. He  fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as  though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept  low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz\\'s left fore leg.  There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on  three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick  and broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz  struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming  eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in  upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten  antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.    There was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing  reserved for gentler climes. He man\\\\xc5\\\\x93uvred for the final rush. The  circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on  his flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half  crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to  fall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz  quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with  horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck  sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely  met shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as  Spitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful  champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found  it good.        Chapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership    \"Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w\\'en I say dat Buck two devils.\" This was  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and  Buck covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light  pointed them out.    \"Dat Spitz fight lak hell,\" said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping  rips and cuts.    \"An\\' dat Buck fight lak two hells,\" was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s answer. \"An\\' now we  make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.\"    While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the  dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place  Spitz would have occupied as leader; but Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, not noticing him,  brought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was  the best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving  him back and standing in his place.    \"Eh? eh?\" Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. \"Look at dat  Buck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t\\'ink to take de job.\"    \"Go \\'way, Chook!\" he cried, but Buck refused to budge.    He took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled  threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old  dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced  Sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was angry. \"Now, by Gar, I feex you!\" he cried, coming back  with a heavy club in his hand.    Buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor  did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought  forward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling  with bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so  as to dodge it if thrown by Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, for he was become wise in the way  of clubs. The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he  was ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated  two or three steps. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois followed him up, whereupon he again  retreated. After some time of this, Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois threw down the club,  thinking that Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He  wanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was  his by right. He had earned it, and he would not be content with less.    Perrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better  part of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him,  and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after  him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and  drop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept  out of their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around  and around the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met,  he would come in and be good.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch  and swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an  hour gone. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned  sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they  were beaten. Then Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called  to Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois  unfastened Sol-leks\\'s traces and put him back in his old place. The  team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the  trail. There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.    \"T\\'row down de club,\" Perrault commanded.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,  and swung around into position at the head of the team. His traces were  fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed  out on to the river trail.    Highly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he  found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound  Buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,  and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior  even of Spitz, of whom Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois had never seen an equal.    But it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that  Buck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.  It was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil  mightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they  did not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for  all they cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team,  however, had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their  surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.    Pike, who pulled at Buck\\'s heels, and who never put an ounce more of  his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was  swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was  done he was pulling more than ever before in his life. The first night  in camp, Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly-a thing that Spitz had  never succeeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of  superior weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to  whine for mercy.    The general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its  old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the  traces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were  added; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s breath.    \"Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!\" he cried. \"No, nevaire! Heem worth  one t\\'ousan\\' dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?\"    And Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day  by day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and  there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too  cold. The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there  the whole trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on  the jump, with but infrequent stoppages.    The Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they  covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In  one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to  the White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy  miles of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to  run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night  of the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea  slope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.    It was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty  miles. For three days Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois threw chests up and down  the main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink,  while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of  dog-busters and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to  clean out the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and  public interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders.  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him.  And that was the last of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and Perrault. Like other men, they  passed out of Buck\\'s life for good.    A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company  with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to  Dawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil  each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,  carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the  shadow of the Pole.    Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in  it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,  whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a  monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was  very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,  fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,  others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before  the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.  Some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the  beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the  dogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it  was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so  with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were  fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought  Buck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got  out of his way.    Best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched  under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes  blinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller\\'s  big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement  swimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the  Japanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the  death of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had  eaten or would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very  dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more  potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never  seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the  memories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later  days, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again.    Sometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it  seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by  this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed  cook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,  with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and  swelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head  slanted back under it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and  seemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered  continually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and  foot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but  naked, a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back,  but on his body there was much hair. In some places, across the chest  and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs, it was  matted into almost a thick fur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk  inclined forward from the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About  his body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost  catlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of  things seen and unseen.    At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between  his legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his  hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.  And beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many  gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the  eyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their  bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.  And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the  fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to  rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his  neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and  the half-breed cook shouted at him, \"Hey, you Buck, wake up!\" Whereupon  the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and  he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.    It was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore  them down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they  made Dawson, and should have had a ten days\\' or a week\\'s rest at least.  But in two days\\' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the  Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the  drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This  meant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier  pulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did  their best for the animals.    Each night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers  ate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet  of the dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the  beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles,  dragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles  will tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates  up to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very  tired. Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.  Joe was sourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side  or other side.    But it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with  him. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at  once made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness  and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the  morning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of  the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The  driver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became  interested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over  their last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a  consultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed  and prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside,  but they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.    By the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling  repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took  him out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.  His intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled.  Sick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling  while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when  he saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the  pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not  bear that another dog should do his work.    When the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the  beaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him  and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side,  striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled,  and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain.  The half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no  heed to the stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike  harder. Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where  the going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft  snow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell,  and lay where he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds  churned by.    With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along  behind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the  sleds to his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver  lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then  he returned and started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with  remarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped  in surprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He  called his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both  of Sol-leks\\'s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in  his proper place.    He pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His  comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied  the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where  dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut  out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die  anyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he  was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more  than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.  Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the  sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.    But he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for  him by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up  time he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on  his feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly  toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would  advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching  movement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for  a few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of  him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could  hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt  of river timber.    Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his  steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A  revolver-shot rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped,  the bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck  knew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river  trees.        Chapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail    Thirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with  Buck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a  wretched state, worn out and worn down. Buck\\'s one hundred and forty  pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates,  though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the  malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully  feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,  and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.    They were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.  Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling  the fatigue of a day\\'s travel. There was nothing the matter with them  except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that  comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a  matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the  slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no  power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had  been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,  every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less  than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during  the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days\\' rest.  When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.  They could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just  managed to keep out of the way of the sled.    \"Mush on, poor sore feets,\" the driver encouraged them as they tottered  down the main street of Skaguay. \"Dis is de las\\'. Den we get one long  res\\'. Eh? For sure. One bully long res\\'.\"    The drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had  covered twelve hundred miles with two days\\' rest, and in the nature of  reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so  many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were  the sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the  congested mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were  official orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the  places of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be  got rid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they were  to be sold.    Three days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really  tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two  men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a  song. The men addressed each other as \"Hal\" and \"Charles.\" Charles was  a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a  mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the  limply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or  twenty, with a big Colt\\'s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about  him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the  most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness-a callowness  sheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why  such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of  things that passes understanding.    Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the  Government agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the  mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of  Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and the others who had gone before. When driven  with his mates to the new owners\\' camp, Buck saw a slipshod and  slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in  disorder; also, he saw a woman. \"Mercedes\" the men called her. She was  Charles\\'s wife and Hal\\'s sister-a nice family party.    Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the  tent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their  manner, but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward  bundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were  packed away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her  men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When  they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it  should go on the back; and when they had put it on the back, and  covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered  overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very  sack, and they unloaded again.    Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and  winking at one another.    \"You\\'ve got a right smart load as it is,\" said one of them; \"and it\\'s  not me should tell you your business, but I wouldn\\'t tote that tent  along if I was you.\"    \"Undreamed of!\" cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.  \"However in the world could I manage without a tent?\"    \"It\\'s springtime, and you won\\'t get any more cold weather,\" the man  replied.    She shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and  ends on top the mountainous load.    \"Think it\\'ll ride?\" one of the men asked.    \"Why shouldn\\'t it?\" Charles demanded rather shortly.    \"Oh, that\\'s all right, that\\'s all right,\" the man hastened meekly to  say. \"I was just a-wonderin\\', that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.\"    Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,  which was not in the least well.    \"An\\' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption  behind them,\" affirmed a second of the men.    \"Certainly,\" said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the  gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. \"Mush!\" he  shouted. \"Mush on there!\"    The dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few  moments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.    \"The lazy brutes, I\\'ll show them,\" he cried, preparing to lash out at  them with the whip.    But Mercedes interfered, crying, \"Oh, Hal, you mustn\\'t,\" as she caught  hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. \"The poor dears! Now you  must promise you won\\'t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or  I won\\'t go a step.\"    \"Precious lot you know about dogs,\" her brother sneered; \"and I wish  you\\'d leave me alone. They\\'re lazy, I tell you, and you\\'ve got to whip  them to get anything out of them. That\\'s their way. You ask any one.  Ask one of those men.\"    Mercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain  written in her pretty face.    \"They\\'re weak as water, if you want to know,\" came the reply from one  of the men. \"Plum tuckered out, that\\'s what\\'s the matter. They need a  rest.\"    \"Rest be blanked,\" said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes  said, \"Oh!\" in pain and sorrow at the oath.    But she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of  her brother. \"Never mind that man,\" she said pointedly. \"You\\'re driving  our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.\"    Again Hal\\'s whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the  breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,  and put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an  anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was  whistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on  her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around  his neck.    \"You poor, poor dears,\" she cried sympathetically, \"why don\\'t you pull  hard?-then you wouldn\\'t be whipped.\" Buck did not like her, but he was  feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day\\'s  miserable work.    One of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot  speech, now spoke up:-    \"It\\'s not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs\\'  sakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by  breaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight  against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.\"    A third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,  Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The  overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates  struggling frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead  the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have  required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal  was not such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over,  spilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never  stopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were  angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust  load. Buck was raging. He broke into a run, the team following his  lead. Hal cried \"Whoa! whoa!\" but they gave no heed. He tripped and was  pulled off his feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs  dashed on up the street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they  scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.    Kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered  belongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,  if they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his  sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and  overhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men  laugh, for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about.  \"Blankets for a hotel\" quoth one of the men who laughed and helped.  \"Half as many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and  all those dishes,-who\\'s going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you  think you\\'re travelling on a Pullman?\"    And so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes  cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after  article was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in  particular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees,  rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go  an inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to  everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even  articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal,  when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her  men and went through them like a tornado.    This accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a  formidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six  Outside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek  and Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip,  brought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though  practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much.  Three were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other  two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know  anything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with  disgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not  to do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly to  trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were  bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which  they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The  two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things  breakable about them.    With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by  twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything  but bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were  proud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs.  They had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in  from Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen  dogs. In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen  dogs should not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not  carry the food for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know  this. They had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so  many dogs, so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders  and nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.    Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was  nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They  were starting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance  between Salt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired,  he was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was  not in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid  and frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.    Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and  the woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went  by it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all  things, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to  pitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get  the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day  they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they  did not make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started  at all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the  distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.    It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they  hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding  would commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained  by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.  And when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal  decided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to  cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver  in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more,  she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food  that Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making  poor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.    Then came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his  dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,  that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he  cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day\\'s  travel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were  frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a  simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make  the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way  earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not  only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to  work themselves.    The first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always  getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful  worker. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from  bad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt\\'s revolver.  It is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on  the ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no  less than die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went  first, followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels  hanging more grittily on to life, but going in the end.    By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had  fallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,  Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and  womanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied  with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and  brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.  Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it,  doubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail  which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of  speech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They  had no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their  muscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because  of this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their  lips in the morning and last at night.    Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was  the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the  work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.  Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.  The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from a  dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute  which concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be lugged in the  rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands  of miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal\\'s views on art, or the  sort of society plays his mother\\'s brother wrote, should have anything  to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes  comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that  direction as in the direction of Charles\\'s political prejudices. And  that Charles\\'s sister\\'s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the  building of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who  disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and  incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her  husband\\'s family. In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp  half pitched, and the dogs unfed.    Mercedes nursed a special grievance-the grievance of sex. She was  pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But  the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save  chivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon  which impeachment of what to her was her most essential  sex-prerogative, she made their lives unendurable. She no longer  considered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted  in riding on the sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed one  hundred and twenty pounds-a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the  weak and starving animals. She rode for days, till they fell in the  traces and the sled stood still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off  and walk, pleaded with her, entreated, the while she wept and  importuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality.    On one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never  did it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat  down on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After  they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for  her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.    In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of  their animals. Hal\\'s theory, which he practised on others, was that one  must get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and  brother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a  club. At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old  squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the  Colt\\'s revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal\\'s hip. A  poor substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped  from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen  state it was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog  wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious  leathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and  indigestible.    And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a  nightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he  fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to  his feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his  beautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted  with dried blood where Hal\\'s club had bruised him. His muscles had  wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so  that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through  the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was  heartbreaking, only Buck\\'s heart was unbreakable. The man in the red  sweater had proved that.    As it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating  skeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very  great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the  bruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant, just  as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and  distant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply  so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a  halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the  spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip  fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to  their feet and staggered on.    There came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not  rise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked  Billee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of  the harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw,  and they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day  Koona went, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be  malignant; Pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not  conscious enough longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still  faithful to the toil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so  little strength with which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far  that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was  fresher; and Buck, still at the head of the team, but no longer  enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it, blind with weakness  half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim  feel of his feet.    It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware  of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by  three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The  whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had  given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur  arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from  the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead  and which had not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was  rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young  buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets  sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling  things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were  booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds  singing, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in  cunning wedges that split the air.    From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of  unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon  was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away  from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang  and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into  the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening  life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like  wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.    With the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing  innocuously, and Charles\\'s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into  John Thornton\\'s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the  dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes  dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log  to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great  stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last  touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled  and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse  advice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that  it would not be followed.    \"They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail  and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,\" Hal said in  response to Thornton\\'s warning to take no more chances on the rotten  ice. \"They told us we couldn\\'t make White River, and here we are.\" This  last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.    \"And they told you true,\" John Thornton answered. \"The bottom\\'s likely  to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,  could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn\\'t risk my carcass on  that ice for all the gold in Alaska.\"    \"That\\'s because you\\'re not a fool, I suppose,\" said Hal. \"All the same,  we\\'ll go on to Dawson.\" He uncoiled his whip. \"Get up there, Buck! Hi!  Get up there! Mush on!\"    Thornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool  and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter  the scheme of things.    But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed  into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed  out, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed  his lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed.  Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he  fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck  made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into  him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times  Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture  came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked  irresolutely up and down.    This was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason  to drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club.  Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell  upon him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike  them, he had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of  impending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the  bank, and it had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten ice  he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster  close at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying  to drive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so  far gone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they  continued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went  down. It was nearly out. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great  distance, he was aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of  pain left him. He no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could  hear the impact of the club upon his body. But it was no longer his  body, it seemed so far away.    And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was  inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang  upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though  struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on  wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his  stiffness.    John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too  convulsed with rage to speak.    \"If you strike that dog again, I\\'ll kill you,\" he at last managed to  say in a choking voice.    \"It\\'s my dog,\" Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came  back. \"Get out of my way, or I\\'ll fix you. I\\'m going to Dawson.\"    Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of  getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes  screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of  hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal\\'s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking  the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to  pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes  cut Buck\\'s traces.    Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his  sister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of  further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out  from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his  head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between  were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was  riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles  stumbled along in the rear.    As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly  hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed  nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the  sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling  along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into  a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air.  Mercedes\\'s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make  one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs  and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The  bottom had dropped out of the trail.    John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.    \"You poor devil,\" said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.        Chapter VI. For the Love of a Man    When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners  had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves  up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still  limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued  warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the  river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water,  listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck  slowly won back his strength.    A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,  and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his  muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For  that matter, they were all loafing,-Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and  Nig,-waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to  Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with  Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first  advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a  mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck\\'s  wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,  she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her  ministrations as much as he did for Thornton\\'s. Nig, equally friendly,  though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and  half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.    To Buck\\'s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They  seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck  grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in  which Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion  Buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love,  genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never  experienced at Judge Miller\\'s down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara  Valley. With the Judge\\'s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a  working partnership; with the Judge\\'s grandsons, a sort of pompous  guardianship; and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified  friendship. But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration,  that was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.    This man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was  the ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a  sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as  if they were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw  further. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to  sit down for a long talk with them (\"gas\" he called it) was as much his  delight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck\\'s head roughly between  his hands, and resting his own head upon Buck\\'s, of shaking him back  and forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love  names. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound  of murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his  heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. And  when, released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes  eloquent, his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion  remained without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim,  \"God! you can all but speak!\"    Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would  often seize Thornton\\'s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the  flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as  Buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this  feigned bite for a caress.    For the most part, however, Buck\\'s love was expressed in adoration.  While he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to  him, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove  her nose under Thornton\\'s hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,  who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton\\'s knee, Buck was  content to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert,  at Thornton\\'s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it,  studying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression,  every movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he  would lie farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of  the man and the occasional movements of his body. And often, such was  the communion in which they lived, the strength of Buck\\'s gaze would  draw John Thornton\\'s head around, and he would return the gaze, without  speech, his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck\\'s heart shone out.    For a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out  of his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it  again, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he  had come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could  be permanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as  Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in  the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times he  would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the  tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master\\'s  breathing.    But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed to  bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,  which the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.  Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet  he retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come  in from the wild to sit by John Thornton\\'s fire, rather than a dog of  the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of  civilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from  this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not  hesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him  to escape detection.    His face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he fought  as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too  good-natured for quarrelling,-besides, they belonged to John Thornton;  but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly  acknowledged Buck\\'s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with  a terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well the  law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back  from a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned from  Spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and  knew there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while  to show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial  life. It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made  for death. Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this  mandate, down out of the depths of Time, he obeyed.    He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He  linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed  through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and  seasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton\\'s fire, a broad-breasted dog,  white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all  manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,  tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,  scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the  sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,  directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,  and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff  of his dreams.    So peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and  the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a  call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously  thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire  and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on  and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the  call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he  gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John  Thornton drew him back to the fire again.    Thornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance  travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and  from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When  Thornton\\'s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,  Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to  Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way,  accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. They  were of the same large type as Thornton, living close to the earth,  thinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into  the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his  ways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet  and Nig.    For Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone  among men, could put a pack upon Buck\\'s back in the summer travelling.  Nothing was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day  (they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left  Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting  on the crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked  bed-rock three hundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the  edge, Buck at his shoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he  drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind.  \"Jump, Buck!\" he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm.  The next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while  Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety.    \"It\\'s uncanny,\" Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their  speech.    Thornton shook his head. \"No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.  Do you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.\"    \"I\\'m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he\\'s  around,\" Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.    \"Py Jingo!\" was Hans\\'s contribution. \"Not mineself either.\"    It was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete\\'s apprehensions  were realized. \"Black\" Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had  been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton  stepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a  corner, head on paws, watching his master\\'s every action. Burton struck  out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent  spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of  the bar.    Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a  something which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck\\'s body  rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton\\'s throat. The man  saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled  backward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth  from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time  the man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn  open. Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a  surgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling  furiously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of  hostile clubs. A \"miners\\' meeting,\" called on the spot, decided that  the dog had sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his  reputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every  camp in Alaska.    Later on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton\\'s life in  quite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow  poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans  and Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from  tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent  by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the  bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off  his master.    At a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks  jutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton  poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in  his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,  and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when  Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat  flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton,  flung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of  the rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.    Buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred  yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt  him grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his  splendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress  down-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where  the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the  rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck  of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was  frightful, and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped  furiously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with  crushing force. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing  Buck, and above the roar of the churning water shouted: \"Go, Buck! Go!\"    Buck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling  desperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton\\'s command  repeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as  though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam  powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point  where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.    They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the  face of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as  fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was  hanging on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing  the boat to Buck\\'s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should  neither strangle him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the  stream. He struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream.  He discovered the mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him  and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried  helplessly past.    Hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The  rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked  under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body  struck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and  Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him  and the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The  faint sound of Thornton\\'s voice came to them, and though they could not  make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His  master\\'s voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his  feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous  departure.    Again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck  out, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once,  but he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,  permitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on  till he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with  the speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him  coming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole  force of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both  arms around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and  Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,  sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the  jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the  bank.    Thornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back and  forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for  Buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a  howl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton  was himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over Buck\\'s  body, when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.    \"That settles it,\" he announced. \"We camp right here.\" And camp they  did, till Buck\\'s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.    That winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,  perhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the  totem-pole of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to  the three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished,  and were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East,  where miners had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a  conversation in the Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of  their favorite dogs. Buck, because of his record, was the target for  these men, and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of  half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five  hundred pounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for  his dog; and a third, seven hundred.    \"Pooh! pooh!\" said John Thornton; \"Buck can start a thousand pounds.\"    \"And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?\" demanded  Matthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.    \"And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,\" John  Thornton said coolly.    \"Well,\" Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could  hear, \"I\\'ve got a thousand dollars that says he can\\'t. And there it  is.\" So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna  sausage down upon the bar.    Nobody spoke. Thornton\\'s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He  could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had  tricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand  pounds. Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great  faith in Buck\\'s strength and had often thought him capable of starting  such a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the  eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had  no thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.    \"I\\'ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of  flour on it,\" Matthewson went on with brutal directness; \"so don\\'t let  that hinder you.\"    Thornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from  face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of  thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it  going again. The face of Jim O\\'Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time  comrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him  to do what he would never have dreamed of doing.    \"Can you lend me a thousand?\" he asked, almost in a whisper.    \"Sure,\" answered O\\'Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of  Matthewson\\'s. \"Though it\\'s little faith I\\'m having, John, that the  beast can do the trick.\"    The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The  tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see  the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred  and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson\\'s  sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a  couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the  runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of  two to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose  concerning the phrase \"break out.\" O\\'Brien contended it was Thornton\\'s  privilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to \"break it out\"  from a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included  breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of  the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,  whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.    There were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.  Thornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now  that he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular  team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible  the task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.    \"Three to one!\" he proclaimed. \"I\\'ll lay you another thousand at that  figure, Thornton. What d\\'ye say?\"    Thornton\\'s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was  aroused-the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize  the impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He  called Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own  the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the  ebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid  it unhesitatingly against Matthewson\\'s six hundred.    The team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was  put into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and  he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.  Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in  perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one  hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit  and virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the  neck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half  bristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of  vigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and  heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the  body, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men  felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went  down to two to one.    \"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king  of the Skookum Benches. \"I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before  the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.\"    Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck\\'s side.    \"You must stand off from him,\" Matthewson protested. \"Free play and  plenty of room.\"    The crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers  vainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent  animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their  eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.    Thornton knelt down by Buck\\'s side. He took his head in his two hands  and rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his  wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. \"As you  love me, Buck. As you love me,\" was what he whispered. Buck whined with  suppressed eagerness.    The crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It  seemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his  mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and  releasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of  speech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.    \"Now, Buck,\" he said.    Buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several  inches. It was the way he had learned.    \"Gee!\" Thornton\\'s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.    Buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up  the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty  pounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp  crackling.    \"Haw!\" Thornton commanded.    Buck duplicated the man\\\\xc5\\\\x93uvre, this time to the left. The crackling  turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and  grating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were  holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.    \"Now, MUSH!\"    Thornton\\'s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself  forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was  gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles  writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great  chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet  were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in  parallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.  One of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled  lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it  never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two  inches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained  momentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.    Men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they  had ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck  with short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he  neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,  a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed  the firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself  loose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men  were shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a  general incoherent babel.    But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and  he was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him  cursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and  lovingly.    \"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" spluttered the Skookum Bench king. \"I\\'ll give you  a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir-twelve hundred, sir.\"    Thornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming  frankly down his cheeks. \"Sir,\" he said to the Skookum Bench king, \"no,  sir. You can go to hell, sir. It\\'s the best I can do for you, sir.\"    Buck seized Thornton\\'s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and  forth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back  to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to  interrupt.        Chapter VII. The Sounding of the Call    When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John  Thornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts  and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost  mine, the history of which was as old as the history of the country.  Many men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there  were who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped  in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The  oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning  there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to  it, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their  testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the  Northland.    But no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were  dead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a  dozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve  where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded  seventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,  passed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart  itself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked  the backbone of the continent.    John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the  wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the  wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.  Being in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course  of the day\\'s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he  kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he  would come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight  meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the  load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless  future.    To Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite  wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold  on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp,  here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through  frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat  of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted  riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of  hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted  across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in  slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.    The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the  uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the  Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,  shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber  line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming  gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and  flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall  of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where  wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of  life-only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered  places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.    And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of  men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the  forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the  path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the  man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another  time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and  amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled  flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days  in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins  packed flat, And that was all-no hint as to the man who in an early day  had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.    Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they  found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where  the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the  washing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them  thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every  day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag,  and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like  giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as  they heaped the treasure up.    There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now  and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the  fire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more  frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,  blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which  he remembered.    The salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the  hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands  clasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and  awakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness  and fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,  where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it  was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs  prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the  forest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man\\'s heels; and they  were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving  and nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as  Buck. The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as  fast as on the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb,  sometimes a dozen feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling,  never missing his grip. In fact, he seemed as much at home among the  trees as on the ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent  beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he  slept.    And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still  sounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest  and strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and  he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.  Sometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though  it were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood  might dictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or  into the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the  fat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment,  behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared  to all that moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that  he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not  know why he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and  did not reason about them at all.    Irresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing  lazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and  his ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet  and dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and  across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run  down dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the  woods. For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he  could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But  especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights,  listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading  signs and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious  something that called-called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him  to come.    One night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils  quivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the  forest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),  distinct and definite as never before,-a long-drawn howl, like, yet  unlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old  familiar way, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping  camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer  to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he  came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on  haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.    He had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense  his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered  compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted  care. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of  friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild  beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with  wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind  channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The  wolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe  and of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his  teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.    Buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with  friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made  three of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck\\'s shoulder.  Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time  and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in  poor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He  would run till Buck\\'s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl  around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.    But in the end Buck\\'s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding  that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they  became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with  which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the  wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was  going somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they  ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek  bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide  where it took its rise.    On the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level  country where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and  through these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the  sun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He  knew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood  brother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories  were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he  stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done  this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,  and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked  earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.    They stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck  remembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the  place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing  noses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned  about and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an  hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat  down, pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and  as Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter  until it was lost in the distance.    John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang  upon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon  him, licking his face, biting his hand-\"playing the general tom-fool,\"  as John Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and  forth and cursed him lovingly.    For two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of  his sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,  saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But  after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously  than ever. Buck\\'s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by  recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the  divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once  again he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no  more; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was  never raised.    He began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a  time; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went  down into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a week,  seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as  he travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never  to tire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere  into the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded  by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest  helpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the  last latent remnants of Buck\\'s ferocity. And two days later, when he  returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the  spoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two  behind who would quarrel no more.    The blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a  thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by  virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a  hostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this  he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated  itself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself in  all his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke  plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious  furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his  muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran  midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic  wolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father  he had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who  had given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf  muzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his  head, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.    His cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,  shepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus  an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable  a creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous animal living on  a straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his  life, overspilling with vigor and virility. When Thornton passed a  caressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the  hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. Every  part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most  exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect  equilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which  required action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as  a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could  leap twice as quickly. He saw the movement, or heard sound, and  responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere  seeing or hearing. He perceived and determined and responded in the  same instant. In point of fact the three actions of perceiving,  determining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were  the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His  muscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply,  like steel springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad  and rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer  ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world.    \"Never was there such a dog,\" said John Thornton one day, as the  partners watched Buck marching out of camp.    \"When he was made, the mould was broke,\" said Pete.    \"Py jingo! I t\\'ink so mineself,\" Hans affirmed.    They saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and  terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the  secrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing  of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that  appeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take  advantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like  a snake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest,  kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks  fleeing a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not  too quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He  killed to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he  killed himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was  his delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them,  to let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.    As the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater  abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less  rigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown  calf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and  he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band  of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,  and chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and,  standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist  as even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great  palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet  within the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,  while he roared with fury at sight of Buck.    From the bull\\'s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered  arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct  which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck  proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He  would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of  the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have  stamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the  fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of  rage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring  him on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus  separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would  charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.    There is a patience of the wild-dogged, tireless, persistent as life  itself-that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,  the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience  belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it  belonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its  march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their  half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.  For half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from  all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out  his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the  patience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that  of creatures preying.    As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest  (the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),  the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the  aid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them on  to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this  tireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of  the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only  one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,  and in the end they were content to pay the toll.    As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his  mates-the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he  had mastered-as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading  light. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless  fanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than  half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight  and struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature  whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.    From then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a  moment\\'s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the  shoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull  opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling  streams they crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long  stretches of flight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him,  but loped easily at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was  played, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely  when he strove to eat or drink.    The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the  shambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long  periods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and  Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to  rest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes  fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming  over the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the  moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.  Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The  news of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but  by some other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet  knew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange  things were afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he  had finished the business in hand.    At last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.  For a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping,  turn and turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his  face toward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope,  and went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way,  heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of  direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame.    As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the  land. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had  been there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon  him in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the  squirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several  times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs,  reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed. He was  oppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity  already happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down  into the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.    Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair  rippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.  Buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and  tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story-all but  the end. His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the  life on the heels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant  silence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in  hiding. One only he saw,-a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray  dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the  wood itself.    As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose  was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped  and pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.  He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow  protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.    A hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs  Thornton had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a  death-struggle, directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him  without stopping. From the camp came the faint sound of many voices,  rising and falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge  of the clearing, he found Hans, lying on his face, feathered with  arrows like a porcupine. At the same instant Buck peered out where the  spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up  on his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him.  He did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible  ferocity. For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp  cunning and reason, and it was because of his great love for John  Thornton that he lost his head.    The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge  when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal  the like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live  hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He  sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping  the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.  He did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the  next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was no  withstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,  rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the  arrows they discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his  movements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they  shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear  at Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with  such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood  out beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to  the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.    And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and  dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was a  fateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the  country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the  survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.  As for Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated  camp. He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the  first moment of surprise. Thornton\\'s desperate struggle was  fresh-written on the earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to  the edge of a deep pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water,  lay Skeet, faithful to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored  from the sluice boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it  contained John Thornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water,  from which no trace led away.    All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.  Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the  lives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It  left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which  ached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he  paused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain  of it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,-a  pride greater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the  noblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club  and fang. He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It  was harder to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all,  were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he  would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their  arrows, spears, and clubs.    Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,  lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the  coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became  alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which  the Yeehats had made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far  away drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp  yelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again  Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in  his memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It  was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and  compellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to  obey. John Thornton was dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the  claims of man no longer bound him.    Hunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the  flanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over  from the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck\\'s valley. Into the  clearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood;  and in the centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue,  waiting their coming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and  a moment\\'s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him.  Like a flash Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without  movement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.  Three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they  drew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.    This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded  together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.  Buck\\'s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.  Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere  at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly  did he whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from  getting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the  creek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He worked  along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course  of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides  and with nothing to do but face the front.    And so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves  drew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the  white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying  down with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their  feet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool.  One wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly  manner, and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a  night and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they  touched noses.    Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed  his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,  Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke  out the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the  call came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down and  howled. This over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around  him, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted  the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung  in behind, yelping in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with  the wild brother, yelping as he ran.      And here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when  the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were  seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of  white centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the  Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are  afraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they,  stealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps,  slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.    Nay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the  camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with  throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the  snow greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats  follow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they  never enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over  the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an  abiding-place.    In the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which  the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,  and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling  timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a  yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the  ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould  overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses  for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.    But he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the  wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running  at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering  borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow  as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.

Into the Primitive    \"Old longings nomadic leap,  Chafing at custom\\'s chain;  Again from its brumal sleep  Wakens the ferine strain.\"      Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble  was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog,  strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San  Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow  metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming  the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men  wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong  muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the  frost.    Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge  Miller\\'s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden  among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide  cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached  by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns  and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things  were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great  stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad  servants\\' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long  grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there  was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank  where Judge Miller\\'s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in  the hot afternoon.    And over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he  had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other  dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they  did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or  lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of  Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,-strange  creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On  the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least,  who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the  windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with  brooms and mops.    But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.  He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge\\'s  sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge\\'s daughters, on long  twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the  Judge\\'s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge\\'s  grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their  footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable  yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.  Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he  utterly ignored, for he was king,-king over all creeping, crawling,  flying things of Judge Miller\\'s place, humans included.    His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge\\'s inseparable  companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was  not so large,-he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,-for his  mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred  and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good  living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right  royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived  the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was  even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become  because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not  becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor  delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as  to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a  health preserver.    And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the  Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.  But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel,  one of the gardener\\'s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel  had one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his  gambling, he had one besetting weakness-faith in a system; and this  made his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while  the wages of a gardener\\'s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife  and numerous progeny.    The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers\\' Association, and the  boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of  Manuel\\'s treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard  on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a  solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known  as College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between  them.    \"You might wrap up the goods before you deliver \\'m,\" the stranger said  gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck\\'s neck  under the collar.    \"Twist it, an\\' you\\'ll choke \\'m plentee,\" said Manuel, and the stranger  grunted a ready affirmative.    Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an  unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and  to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the  ends of the rope were placed in the stranger\\'s hands, he growled  menacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride  believing that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope  tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he  sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the  throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope  tightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue  lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in  all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life  had he been so angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he  knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into  the baggage car.    The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and  that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse  shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He  had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of  riding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the  unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but  Buck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they  relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.    \"Yep, has fits,\" the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the  baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. \"I\\'m  takin\\' \\'m up for the boss to \\'Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks  that he can cure \\'m.\"    Concerning that night\\'s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for  himself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water  front.    \"All I get is fifty for it,\" he grumbled; \"an\\' I wouldn\\'t do it over  for a thousand, cold cash.\"    His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser  leg was ripped from knee to ankle.    \"How much did the other mug get?\" the saloon-keeper demanded.    \"A hundred,\" was the reply. \"Wouldn\\'t take a sou less, so help me.\"    \"That makes a hundred and fifty,\" the saloon-keeper calculated; \"and  he\\'s worth it, or I\\'m a squarehead.\"    The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated  hand. \"If I don\\'t get the hydrophoby-\"    \"It\\'ll be because you was born to hang,\" laughed the saloon-keeper.  \"Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,\" he added.    Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life  half throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But  he was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing  the heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed,  and he was flung into a cagelike crate.    There he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath  and wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did  they want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent  up in this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by  the vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night  he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see  the Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face  of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a  tallow candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck\\'s  throat was twisted into a savage growl.    But the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men  entered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for  they were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed  and raged at them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks  at him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that  that was what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed  the crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he  was imprisoned, began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the  express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another  wagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels,  upon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great  railway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.    For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail  of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate  nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express  messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he  flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at  him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs,  mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he  knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger  waxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of  water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch.  For that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment  had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his  parched and swollen throat and tongue.    He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given  them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.  They would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was  resolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during  those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath  that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned  blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed  was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the  express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the  train at Seattle.    Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,  high-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged  generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.  That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled  himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a  hatchet and a club.    \"You ain\\'t going to take him out now?\" the driver asked.    \"Sure,\" the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.    There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried  it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the  performance.    Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging  and wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was  there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get  out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.    \"Now, you red-eyed devil,\" he said, when he had made an opening  sufficient for the passage of Buck\\'s body. At the same time he dropped  the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.    And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for  the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his  blood-shot eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and  forty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and  nights. In mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he  received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together  with an agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his  back and side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did  not understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was  again on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came  and he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware  that it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he  charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.    After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to  rush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth  and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.  Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on  the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the  exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its  ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the  club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the  same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete  circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on  his head and chest.    For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had  purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,  knocked utterly senseless.    \"He\\'s no slouch at dog-breakin\\', that\\'s wot I say,\" one of the men on  the wall cried enthusiastically.    \"Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,\" was the reply of  the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.    Buck\\'s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he  had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.    \"\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Answers to the name of Buck,\\'\" the man soliloquized, quoting from the  saloon-keeper\\'s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate  and contents. \"Well, Buck, my boy,\" he went on in a genial voice,  \"we\\'ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let  it go at that. You\\'ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good  dog and all \\'ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I\\'ll  whale the stuffin\\' outa you. Understand?\"    As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly  pounded, and though Buck\\'s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the  hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he  drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by  chunk, from the man\\'s hand.    He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for  all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned  the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was  a revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,  and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a  fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it  with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by,  other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and  some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched  them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and  again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven  home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed,  though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty,  though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged  their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would  neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for  mastery.    Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,  and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such  times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of  the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never  came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was  glad each time when he was not selected.    Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who  spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which  Buck could not understand.    \"Sacredam!\" he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. \"Dat one dam bully  dog! Eh? How moch?\"    \"Three hundred, and a present at that,\" was the prompt reply of the man  in the red sweater. \"And seem\\' it\\'s government money, you ain\\'t got no  kick coming, eh, Perrault?\"    Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed  skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an  animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its  despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at  Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand-\"One in ten t\\'ousand,\" he  commented mentally.    Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a  good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened  man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as  Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the _Narwhal_,  it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken  below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was  a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new  kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and  while he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew  honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice,  and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.    In the \\'tween-decks of the _Narwhal_, Buck and Curly joined two other  dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had  been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a  Geological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous  sort of way, smiling into one\\'s face the while he meditated some  underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck\\'s food at  the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s  whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing  remained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, he  decided, and the half-breed began his rise in Buck\\'s estimation.    The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not  attempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow,  and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone,  and further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone.  \"Dave\" he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times,  and took interest in nothing, not even when the _Narwhal_ crossed Queen  Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing  possessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he  raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious  glance, yawned, and went to sleep again.    Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,  and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that  the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the  propeller was quiet, and the _Narwhal_ was pervaded with an atmosphere  of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a  change was at hand. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois leashed them and brought them on deck. At  the first step upon the cold surface, Buck\\'s feet sank into a white  mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of  this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but  more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up  on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This  puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers  laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was  his first snow.        Chapter II. The Law of Club and Fang    Buck\\'s first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was  filled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the  heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. No  lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be  bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment\\'s safety. All was  confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.  There was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and  men were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who  knew no law but the law of club and fang.    He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his  first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was  a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.  Curly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she,  in her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a  full-grown wolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning,  only a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out  equally swift, and Curly\\'s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.    It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there  was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and  surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not  comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they  were licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again  and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar  fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This  was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her,  snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath  the bristling mass of bodies.    So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw  Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he  saw Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men  with clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two  minutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were  clubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody,  trampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed  standing over her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to  Buck to trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play.  Once down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he  never went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from  that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.    Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of  Curly, he received another shock. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois fastened upon him an  arrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had  seen the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses  work, so he was set to work, hauling Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois on a sled to the forest  that fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though  his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was  too wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though  it was all new and strange. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was stern, demanding instant  obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while  Dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck\\'s hind quarters  whenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,  and while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now  and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck  into the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined  tuition of his two mates and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois made remarkable progress. Ere  they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at \"ho,\" to go ahead at  \"mush,\" to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler  when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.    \"T\\'ree vair\\' good dogs,\" Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois told Perrault. \"Dat Buck, heem pool  lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt\\'ing.\"    By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his  despatches, returned with two more dogs. \"Billee\" and \"Joe\" he called  them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother  though they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee\\'s one  fault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite,  sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.  Buck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz  proceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his  tail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no  avail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz\\'s sharp teeth scored  his flank. But no matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his  heels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and  snarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes  diabolically gleaming-the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible  was his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him;  but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and  wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.    By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean  and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a  warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks,  which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing,  expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into  their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which  Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached  on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the  first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled  upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and  down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of  their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like  Dave\\'s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn,  each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.    That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent,  illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain;  and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he  recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer  cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with  especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and  attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet.  Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents,  only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there  savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled  (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.    Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own  team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared.  Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and  again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else  he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be?  With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he  aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore  legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang  back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a  friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A  whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under  the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed  and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured,  as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck\\'s face with his warm wet tongue.    Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently  selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a  hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined  space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he  slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and  wrestled with bad dreams.    Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.  At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night  and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side,  and a great surge of fear swept through him-the fear of the wild thing  for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own  life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an  unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so  could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted  spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders  stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into  the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he  landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and  knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he  went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the  night before.    A shout from Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois hailed his appearance. \"Wot I say?\" the  dog-driver cried to Perrault. \"Dat Buck for sure learn queek as  anyt\\'ing.\"    Perrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government,  bearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs,  and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.    Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a  total of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they  were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Ca\\\\xc3\\\\xb1on. Buck  was glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not  particularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which  animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still  more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were  new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and  unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious  that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by  delay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed  the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and  the only thing in which they took delight.    Dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then  came Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,  to the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.    Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he  might receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally  apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing  their teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He  never nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he  stood in need of it. As Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s whip backed him up, Buck found it to  be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief  halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both  Dave and Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The  resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the  traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he  mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s whip  snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up  his feet and carefully examining them.    It was a hard day\\'s run, up the Ca\\\\xc3\\\\xb1on, through Sheep Camp, past the  Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of  feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the  salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely  North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the  craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge  camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were  building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made  his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all  too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his  mates to the sled.    That day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next  day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked  harder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of  the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for  them. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged  places with him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided  himself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for  the fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was  no ice at all.    Day after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,  they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them  hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always  they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to  sleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of  sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go  nowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.  Yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the  life, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good  condition.    He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old  life. A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed  him of his unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was  fighting off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the  others. To remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did  hunger compel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him.  He watched and learned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever  malingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault\\'s back  was turned, he duplicated the performance the following day, getting  away with the whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was  unsuspected; while Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting  caught, was punished for Buck\\'s misdeed.    This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland  environment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself  to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and  terrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his  moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for  existence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of  love and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;  but in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such  things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he  would fail to prosper.    Not that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and  unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his  days, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But the  club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more  fundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a  moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller\\'s riding-whip; but  the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability  to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.  He did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his  stomach. He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out  of respect for club and fang. In short, the things he did were done  because it was easier to do them than not to do them.    His development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard  as iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an  internal as well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter  how loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his  stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood  carried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the  toughest and stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably  keen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he  heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril.  He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between  his toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice  over the water hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with  stiff fore legs. His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the  wind and forecast it a night in advance. No matter how breathless the  air when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew  inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.    And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became  alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways  he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs  ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as  they ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and  slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten  ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks  which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.  They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been  his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at  a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and  dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and  through him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which  voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and  the cold, and dark.    Thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged  through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had  found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener\\'s  helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers  small copies of himself.        Chapter III. The Dominant Primordial Beast    The dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce  conditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.  His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy  adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he  not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A certain  deliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to rashness  and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz  he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.    On the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous  rival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even  went out of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the  fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in  the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted  accident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp  on the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a  white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping  place. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a  perpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois were compelled to  make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake  itself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light. A  few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down  through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.    Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm  was it, that he was loath to leave it when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois distributed the  fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished  his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl  told him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided  trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared.  He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz  particularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him  that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own  only because of his great weight and size.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the  disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. \"A-a-ah!\" he  cried to Buck. \"Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty  t\\'eef!\"    Spitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness  as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no  less eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth  for the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the  thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future,  past many a weary mile of trail and toil.    An oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony  frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of  pandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking  furry forms,-starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had  scented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck  and Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with  stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed  by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the  grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box  was capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished  brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon  them unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but  struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.    In the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests  only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such  dogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.  They were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with  blazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them  terrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs  were swept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by  three huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and  slashed. The din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and  Sol-leks, dripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely  side by side. Joe was snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on  the fore leg of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike,  the malingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with  a quick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the  throat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the  jugular. The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater  fierceness. He flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt  teeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking  from the side.    Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,  hurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts  rolled back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only  for a moment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub,  upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee,  terrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away  over the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the  team behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of  the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident  intention of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of  huskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock  of Spitz\\'s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.    Later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the  forest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not  one who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded  grievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky  added to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an  eye; while Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to  ribbons, cried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they  limped warily back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men  in bad tempers. Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had  chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact,  nothing, no matter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had  eaten a pair of Perrault\\'s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the  leather traces, and even two feet of lash from the end of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s  whip. He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his  wounded dogs.    \"Ah, my frien\\'s,\" he said softly, \"mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many  bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t\\'ink, eh, Perrault?\"    The courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail  still between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break  out among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses  into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling  painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,  and for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.    The Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,  and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held  at all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty  terrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was  accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,  Perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by  the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time  across the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the  thermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke  through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his  garments.    Nothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had  been chosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks,  resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and  struggling on from dim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on  rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not  halt. Once, the sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were  half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The  usual fire was necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with  ice, and the two men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and  thawing, so close that they were singed by the flames.    At another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him  up to Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws  on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But  behind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled  was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, pulling till his tendons cracked.    Again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no  escape except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled  lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs  were hoisted, one by one, to the cliff crest. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois came up last,  after the sled and load. Then came the search for a place to descend,  which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night  found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day\\'s  credit.    By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played  out. The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make  up lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they covered  thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to  the Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well  up toward the Five Fingers.    Buck\\'s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.  His had softened during the many generations since the day his last  wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he  limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry  as he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois had to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck\\'s feet  for half an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of  his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great  relief, and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist  itself into a grin one morning, when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois forgot the moccasins and  Buck lay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and  refused to budge without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail,  and the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away.    At the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had  never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced  her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog  bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a  dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew  that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away  he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could  she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so  great was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the  island, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with  rough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the  main river, and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time,  though he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap  behind. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled  back, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all  his faith in that Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois would save him. The dog-driver held the axe  poised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon  mad Dolly\\'s head.    Buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,  helpless. This was Spitz\\'s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice  his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh  to the bone. Then Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s lash descended, and Buck had the  satisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet  administered to any of the teams.    \"One devil, dat Spitz,\" remarked Perrault. \"Some dam day heem keel dat  Buck.\"    \"Dat Buck two devils,\" was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s rejoinder. \"All de tam I watch  dat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak  hell an\\' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an\\' spit heem out on de snow.  Sure. I know.\"    From then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and  acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this  strange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many  Southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and  on trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and  starvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered,  matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a  masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club  of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness  out of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could  bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.    It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck  wanted it. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been  gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and  trace-that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which  lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if  they are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as  wheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride  that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour  and sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride  that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at  night, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This  was the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who  blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in  the morning. Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a  possible lead-dog. And this was Buck\\'s pride, too.    He openly threatened the other\\'s leadership. He came between him and  the shirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One  night there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the  malingerer, did not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a  foot of snow. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was  wild with wrath. He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in  every likely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and  shivered in his hiding-place.    But when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him,  Buck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so  shrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.  Pike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,  and sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a  forgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, chuckling at  the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought  his lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck  from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into  play. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash  laid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many  times offending Pike.    In the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still  continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it  craftily, when Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,  a general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks  were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.  Things no longer went right. There was continual bickering and  jangling. Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck.  He kept Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension  of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take  place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of  quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his  sleeping robe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.    But the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson  one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many  men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the  ordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up  and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling  bells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up  to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa  Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main  they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine,  at twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie  chant, in which it was Buck\\'s delight to join.    With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping  in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of  snow, this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life,  only it was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and  half-sobs, and was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of  existence. It was an old song, old as the breed itself-one of the first  songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was  invested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which  Buck was so strangely stirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with  the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and  the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and  mystery. And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness  with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw  beginnings of life in the howling ages.    Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the  steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and  Salt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent  than those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,  and he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things  favored him in this. The week\\'s rest had recuperated the dogs and put  them in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was  packed hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged  in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was  travelling light.    They made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and  the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to  Pelly. But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble  and vexation on the part of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois. The insidious revolt led by Buck  had destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog  leaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them  into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader  greatly to be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to  challenging his authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night,  and gulped it down under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and  Joe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. And  even Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not  half so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz  without snarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct  approached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down  before Spitz\\'s very nose.    The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their  relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever  among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and  Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the  unending squabbling. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois swore strange barbarous oaths, and  stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always  singing among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back  was turned they were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip,  while Buck backed up the remainder of the team. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois knew he was  behind all the trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever  ever again to be caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the  harness, for the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater  delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the  traces.    At the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a  snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team  was in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest  Police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit  sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed  of which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow,  while the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack,  sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay  down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing  forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap,  like some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.    All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men  out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by  chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to  kill-all this was Buck\\'s, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was  ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the  living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes  in warm blood.    There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which  life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes  when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that  one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the  artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to  the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it  came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining  after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through  the moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the  parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb  of Time. He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave  of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in  that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and  rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the  stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.    But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the  pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long  bend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the  frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and  larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate  path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the  white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a  stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging  down from Life\\'s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck\\'s  heels raised a hell\\'s chorus of delight.    Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon  Spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They  rolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost  as though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder  and leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel  jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and  lifting lips that writhed and snarled.    In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As  they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the  advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He  seemed to remember it all,-the white woods, and earth, and moonlight,  and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a  ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air-nothing moved,  not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and  lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe  rabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn  up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only  gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was  nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had  always been, the wonted way of things.    Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and  across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of  dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never  blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his  enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he  was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first  defended that attack.    In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.  Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by  the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,  but Buck could not penetrate his enemy\\'s guard. Then he warmed up and  enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried  for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and  each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took  to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his  head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the  shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead,  Buck\\'s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly  away.    Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting  hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and  wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck  grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for  footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs  started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle  sank down again and waited.    But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness-imagination. He  fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as  though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept  low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz\\'s left fore leg.  There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on  three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick  and broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz  struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming  eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in  upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten  antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.    There was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing  reserved for gentler climes. He man\\\\xc5\\\\x93uvred for the final rush. The  circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on  his flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half  crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to  fall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz  quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with  horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck  sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely  met shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as  Spitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful  champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found  it good.        Chapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership    \"Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w\\'en I say dat Buck two devils.\" This was  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and  Buck covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light  pointed them out.    \"Dat Spitz fight lak hell,\" said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping  rips and cuts.    \"An\\' dat Buck fight lak two hells,\" was Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s answer. \"An\\' now we  make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.\"    While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the  dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place  Spitz would have occupied as leader; but Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, not noticing him,  brought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was  the best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving  him back and standing in his place.    \"Eh? eh?\" Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. \"Look at dat  Buck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t\\'ink to take de job.\"    \"Go \\'way, Chook!\" he cried, but Buck refused to budge.    He took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled  threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old  dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced  Sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois was angry. \"Now, by Gar, I feex you!\" he cried, coming back  with a heavy club in his hand.    Buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor  did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought  forward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling  with bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so  as to dodge it if thrown by Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois, for he was become wise in the way  of clubs. The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he  was ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated  two or three steps. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois followed him up, whereupon he again  retreated. After some time of this, Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois threw down the club,  thinking that Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He  wanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was  his by right. He had earned it, and he would not be content with less.    Perrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better  part of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him,  and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after  him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and  drop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept  out of their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around  and around the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met,  he would come in and be good.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch  and swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an  hour gone. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned  sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they  were beaten. Then Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called  to Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois  unfastened Sol-leks\\'s traces and put him back in his old place. The  team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the  trail. There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.    \"T\\'row down de club,\" Perrault commanded.    Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,  and swung around into position at the head of the team. His traces were  fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed  out on to the river trail.    Highly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he  found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound  Buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,  and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior  even of Spitz, of whom Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois had never seen an equal.    But it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that  Buck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.  It was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil  mightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they  did not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for  all they cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team,  however, had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their  surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.    Pike, who pulled at Buck\\'s heels, and who never put an ounce more of  his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was  swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was  done he was pulling more than ever before in his life. The first night  in camp, Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly-a thing that Spitz had  never succeeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of  superior weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to  whine for mercy.    The general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its  old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the  traces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were  added; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois\\'s breath.    \"Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!\" he cried. \"No, nevaire! Heem worth  one t\\'ousan\\' dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?\"    And Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day  by day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and  there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too  cold. The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there  the whole trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on  the jump, with but infrequent stoppages.    The Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they  covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In  one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to  the White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy  miles of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to  run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night  of the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea  slope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.    It was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty  miles. For three days Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois threw chests up and down  the main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink,  while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of  dog-busters and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to  clean out the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and  public interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders.  Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him.  And that was the last of Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and Perrault. Like other men, they  passed out of Buck\\'s life for good.    A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company  with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to  Dawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil  each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,  carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the  shadow of the Pole.    Buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in  it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,  whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a  monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was  very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,  fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,  others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before  the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.  Some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the  beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the  dogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it  was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so  with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were  fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought  Buck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got  out of his way.    Best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched  under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes  blinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller\\'s  big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement  swimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the  Japanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the  death of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had  eaten or would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very  dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more  potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never  seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the  memories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later  days, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again.    Sometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it  seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by  this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed  cook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,  with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and  swelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head  slanted back under it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and  seemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered  continually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and  foot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but  naked, a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back,  but on his body there was much hair. In some places, across the chest  and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs, it was  matted into almost a thick fur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk  inclined forward from the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About  his body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost  catlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of  things seen and unseen.    At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between  his legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his  hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.  And beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many  gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the  eyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their  bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.  And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the  fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to  rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his  neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and  the half-breed cook shouted at him, \"Hey, you Buck, wake up!\" Whereupon  the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and  he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.    It was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore  them down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they  made Dawson, and should have had a ten days\\' or a week\\'s rest at least.  But in two days\\' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the  Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the  drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This  meant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier  pulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did  their best for the animals.    Each night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers  ate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet  of the dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the  beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles,  dragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles  will tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates  up to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very  tired. Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.  Joe was sourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side  or other side.    But it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with  him. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at  once made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness  and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the  morning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of  the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The  driver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became  interested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over  their last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a  consultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed  and prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside,  but they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.    By the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling  repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took  him out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.  His intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled.  Sick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling  while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when  he saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the  pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not  bear that another dog should do his work.    When the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the  beaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him  and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side,  striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled,  and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain.  The half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no  heed to the stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike  harder. Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where  the going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft  snow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell,  and lay where he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds  churned by.    With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along  behind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the  sleds to his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver  lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then  he returned and started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with  remarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped  in surprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He  called his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both  of Sol-leks\\'s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in  his proper place.    He pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His  comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied  the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where  dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut  out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die  anyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he  was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more  than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.  Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the  sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.    But he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for  him by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up  time he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on  his feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly  toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would  advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching  movement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for  a few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of  him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could  hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt  of river timber.    Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his  steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A  revolver-shot rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped,  the bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck  knew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river  trees.        Chapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail    Thirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with  Buck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a  wretched state, worn out and worn down. Buck\\'s one hundred and forty  pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates,  though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the  malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully  feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,  and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.    They were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.  Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling  the fatigue of a day\\'s travel. There was nothing the matter with them  except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that  comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a  matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the  slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no  power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had  been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,  every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less  than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during  the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days\\' rest.  When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.  They could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just  managed to keep out of the way of the sled.    \"Mush on, poor sore feets,\" the driver encouraged them as they tottered  down the main street of Skaguay. \"Dis is de las\\'. Den we get one long  res\\'. Eh? For sure. One bully long res\\'.\"    The drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had  covered twelve hundred miles with two days\\' rest, and in the nature of  reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so  many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were  the sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the  congested mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were  official orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the  places of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be  got rid of, and, since dogs count for little again'"

              "'st dollars, they were  to be sold.    Three days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really  tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two  men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a  song. The men addressed each other as \"Hal\" and \"Charles.\" Charles was  a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a  mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the  limply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or  twenty, with a big Colt\\'s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about  him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the  most salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness-a callowness  sheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why  such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of  things that passes understanding.    Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the  Government agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the  mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of  Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and the others who had gone before. When driven  with his mates to the new owners\\' camp, Buck saw a slipshod and  slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in  disorder; also, he saw a woman. \"Mercedes\" the men called her. She was  Charles\\'s wife and Hal\\'s sister-a nice family party.    Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the  tent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their  manner, but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward  bundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were  packed away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her  men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When  they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it  should go on the back; and when they had put it on the back, and  covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered  overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very  sack, and they unloaded again.    Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and  winking at one another.    \"You\\'ve got a right smart load as it is,\" said one of them; \"and it\\'s  not me should tell you your business, but I wouldn\\'t tote that tent  along if I was you.\"    \"Undreamed of!\" cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.  \"However in the world could I manage without a tent?\"    \"It\\'s springtime, and you won\\'t get any more cold weather,\" the man  replied.    She shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and  ends on top the mountainous load.    \"Think it\\'ll ride?\" one of the men asked.    \"Why shouldn\\'t it?\" Charles demanded rather shortly.    \"Oh, that\\'s all right, that\\'s all right,\" the man hastened meekly to  say. \"I was just a-wonderin\\', that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.\"    Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,  which was not in the least well.    \"An\\' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption  behind them,\" affirmed a second of the men.    \"Certainly,\" said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the  gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. \"Mush!\" he  shouted. \"Mush on there!\"    The dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few  moments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.    \"The lazy brutes, I\\'ll show them,\" he cried, preparing to lash out at  them with the whip.    But Mercedes interfered, crying, \"Oh, Hal, you mustn\\'t,\" as she caught  hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. \"The poor dears! Now you  must promise you won\\'t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or  I won\\'t go a step.\"    \"Precious lot you know about dogs,\" her brother sneered; \"and I wish  you\\'d leave me alone. They\\'re lazy, I tell you, and you\\'ve got to whip  them to get anything out of them. That\\'s their way. You ask any one.  Ask one of those men.\"    Mercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain  written in her pretty face.    \"They\\'re weak as water, if you want to know,\" came the reply from one  of the men. \"Plum tuckered out, that\\'s what\\'s the matter. They need a  rest.\"    \"Rest be blanked,\" said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes  said, \"Oh!\" in pain and sorrow at the oath.    But she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of  her brother. \"Never mind that man,\" she said pointedly. \"You\\'re driving  our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.\"    Again Hal\\'s whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the  breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,  and put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an  anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was  whistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on  her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around  his neck.    \"You poor, poor dears,\" she cried sympathetically, \"why don\\'t you pull  hard?-then you wouldn\\'t be whipped.\" Buck did not like her, but he was  feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day\\'s  miserable work.    One of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot  speech, now spoke up:-    \"It\\'s not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs\\'  sakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by  breaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight  against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.\"    A third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,  Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The  overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates  struggling frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead  the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have  required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal  was not such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over,  spilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never  stopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were  angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust  load. Buck was raging. He broke into a run, the team following his  lead. Hal cried \"Whoa! whoa!\" but they gave no heed. He tripped and was  pulled off his feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs  dashed on up the street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they  scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.    Kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered  belongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,  if they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his  sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and  overhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men  laugh, for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about.  \"Blankets for a hotel\" quoth one of the men who laughed and helped.  \"Half as many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and  all those dishes,-who\\'s going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you  think you\\'re travelling on a Pullman?\"    And so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes  cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after  article was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in  particular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees,  rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go  an inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to  everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even  articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal,  when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her  men and went through them like a tornado.    This accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a  formidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six  Outside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek  and Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip,  brought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though  practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much.  Three were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other  two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know  anything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with  disgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not  to do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly to  trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were  bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which  they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The  two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things  breakable about them.    With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by  twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything  but bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were  proud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs.  They had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in  from Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen  dogs. In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen  dogs should not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not  carry the food for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know  this. They had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so  many dogs, so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders  and nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.    Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was  nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They  were starting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance  between Salt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired,  he was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was  not in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid  and frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.    Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and  the woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went  by it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all  things, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to  pitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get  the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day  they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they  did not make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started  at all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the  distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.    It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they  hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding  would commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained  by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.  And when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal  decided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to  cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver  in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more,  she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food  that Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making  poor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.    Then came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his  dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,  that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he  cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day\\'s  travel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were  frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a  simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make  the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way  earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not  only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to  work themselves.    The first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always  getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful  worker. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from  bad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt\\'s revolver.  It is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on  the ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no  less than die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went  first, followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels  hanging more grittily on to life, but going in the end.    By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had  fallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,  Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and  womanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied  with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and  brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.  Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it,  doubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail  which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of  speech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They  had no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their  muscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because  of this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their  lips in the morning and last at night.    Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was  the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the  work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.  Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.  The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from a  dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute  which concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be lugged in the  rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands  of miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal\\'s views on art, or the  sort of society plays his mother\\'s brother wrote, should have anything  to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes  comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that  direction as in the direction of Charles\\'s political prejudices. And  that Charles\\'s sister\\'s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the  building of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who  disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and  incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her  husband\\'s family. In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp  half pitched, and the dogs unfed.    Mercedes nursed a special grievance-the grievance of sex. She was  pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But  the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save  chivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon  which impeachment of what to her was her most essential  sex-prerogative, she made their lives unendurable. She no longer  considered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted  in riding on the sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed one  hundred and twenty pounds-a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the  weak and starving animals. She rode for days, till they fell in the  traces and the sled stood still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off  and walk, pleaded with her, entreated, the while she wept and  importuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality.    On one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never  did it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat  down on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After  they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for  her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.    In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of  their animals. Hal\\'s theory, which he practised on others, was that one  must get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and  brother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a  club. At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old  squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the  Colt\\'s revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal\\'s hip. A  poor substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped  from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen  state it was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog  wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious  leathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and  indigestible.    And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a  nightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he  fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to  his feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his  beautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted  with dried blood where Hal\\'s club had bruised him. His muscles had  wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so  that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through  the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was  heartbreaking, only Buck\\'s heart was unbreakable. The man in the red  sweater had proved that.    As it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating  skeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very  great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the  bruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant, just  as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and  distant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply  so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a  halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the  spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip  fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to  their feet and staggered on.    There came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not  rise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked  Billee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of  the harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw,  and they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day  Koona went, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be  malignant; Pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not  conscious enough longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still  faithful to the toil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so  little strength with which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far  that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was  fresher; and Buck, still at the head of the team, but no longer  enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it, blind with weakness  half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim  feel of his feet.    It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware  of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by  three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The  whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had  given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur  arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from  the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead  and which had not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was  rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young  buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets  sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling  things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were  booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds  singing, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in  cunning wedges that split the air.    From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of  unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon  was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away  from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang  and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into  the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening  life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like  wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.    With the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing  innocuously, and Charles\\'s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into  John Thornton\\'s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the  dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes  dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log  to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great  stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last  touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled  and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse  advice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that  it would not be followed.    \"They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail  and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,\" Hal said in  response to Thornton\\'s warning to take no more chances on the rotten  ice. \"They told us we couldn\\'t make White River, and here we are.\" This  last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.    \"And they told you true,\" John Thornton answered. \"The bottom\\'s likely  to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,  could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn\\'t risk my carcass on  that ice for all the gold in Alaska.\"    \"That\\'s because you\\'re not a fool, I suppose,\" said Hal. \"All the same,  we\\'ll go on to Dawson.\" He uncoiled his whip. \"Get up there, Buck! Hi!  Get up there! Mush on!\"    Thornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool  and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter  the scheme of things.    But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed  into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed  out, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed  his lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed.  Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he  fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck  made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into  him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times  Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture  came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked  irresolutely up and down.    This was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason  to drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club.  Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell  upon him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike  them, he had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of  impending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the  bank, and it had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten ice  he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster  close at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying  to drive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so  far gone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they  continued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went  down. It was nearly out. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great  distance, he was aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of  pain left him. He no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could  hear the impact of the club upon his body. But it was no longer his  body, it seemed so far away.    And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was  inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang  upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though  struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on  wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his  stiffness.    John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too  convulsed with rage to speak.    \"If you strike that dog again, I\\'ll kill you,\" he at last managed to  say in a choking voice.    \"It\\'s my dog,\" Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came  back. \"Get out of my way, or I\\'ll fix you. I\\'m going to Dawson.\"    Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of  getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes  screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of  hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal\\'s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking  the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to  pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes  cut Buck\\'s traces.    Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his  sister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of  further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out  from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his  head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between  were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was  riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles  stumbled along in the rear.    As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly  hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed  nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the  sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling  along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into  a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air.  Mercedes\\'s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make  one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs  and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The  bottom had dropped out of the trail.    John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.    \"You poor devil,\" said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.        Chapter VI. For the Love of a Man    When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners  had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves  up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still  limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued  warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the  river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water,  listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck  slowly won back his strength.    A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,  and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his  muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For  that matter, they were all loafing,-Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and  Nig,-waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to  Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with  Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first  advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a  mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck\\'s  wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,  she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her  ministrations as much as he did for Thornton\\'s. Nig, equally friendly,  though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and  half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.    To Buck\\'s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They  seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck  grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in  which Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion  Buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love,  genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never  experienced at Judge Miller\\'s down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara  Valley. With the Judge\\'s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a  working partnership; with the Judge\\'s grandsons, a sort of pompous  guardianship; and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified  friendship. But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration,  that was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.    This man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was  the ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a  sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as  if they were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw  further. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to  sit down for a long talk with them (\"gas\" he called it) was as much his  delight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck\\'s head roughly between  his hands, and resting his own head upon Buck\\'s, of shaking him back  and forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love  names. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound  of murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his  heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. And  when, released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes  eloquent, his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion  remained without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim,  \"God! you can all but speak!\"    Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would  often seize Thornton\\'s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the  flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as  Buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this  feigned bite for a caress.    For the most part, however, Buck\\'s love was expressed in adoration.  While he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to  him, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove  her nose under Thornton\\'s hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,  who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton\\'s knee, Buck was  content to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert,  at Thornton\\'s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it,  studying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression,  every movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he  would lie farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of  the man and the occasional movements of his body. And often, such was  the communion in which they lived, the strength of Buck\\'s gaze would  draw John Thornton\\'s head around, and he would return the gaze, without  speech, his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck\\'s heart shone out.    For a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out  of his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it  again, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he  had come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could  be permanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as  Perrault and Fran\\\\xc3\\\\xa7ois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in  the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times he  would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the  tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master\\'s  breathing.    But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed to  bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,  which the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.  Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet  he retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come  in from the wild to sit by John Thornton\\'s fire, rather than a dog of  the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of  civilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from  this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not  hesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him  to escape detection.    His face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he fought  as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too  good-natured for quarrelling,-besides, they belonged to John Thornton;  but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly  acknowledged Buck\\'s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with  a terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well the  law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back  from a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned from  Spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and  knew there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while  to show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial  life. It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made  for death. Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this  mandate, down out of the depths of Time, he obeyed.    He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He  linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed  through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and  seasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton\\'s fire, a broad-breasted dog,  white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all  manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,  tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,  scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the  sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,  directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,  and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff  of his dreams.    So peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and  the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a  call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously  thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire  and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on  and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the  call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he  gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John  Thornton drew him back to the fire again.    Thornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance  travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and  from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When  Thornton\\'s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,  Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to  Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way,  accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. They  were of the same large type as Thornton, living close to the earth,  thinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into  the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his  ways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet  and Nig.    For Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone  among men, could put a pack upon Buck\\'s back in the summer travelling.  Nothing was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day  (they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left  Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting  on the crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked  bed-rock three hundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the  edge, Buck at his shoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he  drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind.  \"Jump, Buck!\" he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm.  The next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while  Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety.    \"It\\'s uncanny,\" Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their  speech.    Thornton shook his head. \"No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.  Do you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.\"    \"I\\'m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he\\'s  around,\" Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.    \"Py Jingo!\" was Hans\\'s contribution. \"Not mineself either.\"    It was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete\\'s apprehensions  were realized. \"Black\" Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had  been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton  stepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a  corner, head on paws, watching his master\\'s every action. Burton struck  out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent  spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of  the bar.    Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a  something which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck\\'s body  rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton\\'s throat. The man  saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled  backward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth  from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time  the man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn  open. Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a  surgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling  furiously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of  hostile clubs. A \"miners\\' meeting,\" called on the spot, decided that  the dog had sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his  reputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every  camp in Alaska.    Later on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton\\'s life in  quite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow  poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans  and Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from  tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent  by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the  bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off  his master.    At a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks  jutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton  poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in  his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,  and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when  Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat  flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton,  flung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of  the rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.    Buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred  yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt  him grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his  splendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress  down-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where  the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the  rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck  of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was  frightful, and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped  furiously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with  crushing force. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing  Buck, and above the roar of the churning water shouted: \"Go, Buck! Go!\"    Buck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling  desperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton\\'s command  repeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as  though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam  powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point  where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.    They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the  face of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as  fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was  hanging on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing  the boat to Buck\\'s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should  neither strangle him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the  stream. He struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream.  He discovered the mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him  and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried  helplessly past.    Hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The  rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked  under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body  struck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and  Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him  and the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The  faint sound of Thornton\\'s voice came to them, and though they could not  make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His  master\\'s voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his  feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous  departure.    Again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck  out, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once,  but he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,  permitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on  till he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with  the speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him  coming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole  force of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both  arms around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and  Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,  sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the  jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the  bank.    Thornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back and  forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for  Buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a  howl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton  was himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over Buck\\'s  body, when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.    \"That settles it,\" he announced. \"We camp right here.\" And camp they  did, till Buck\\'s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.    That winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,  perhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the  totem-pole of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to  the three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished,  and were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East,  where miners had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a  conversation in the Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of  their favorite dogs. Buck, because of his record, was the target for  these men, and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of  half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five  hundred pounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for  his dog; and a third, seven hundred.    \"Pooh! pooh!\" said John Thornton; \"Buck can start a thousand pounds.\"    \"And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?\" demanded  Matthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.    \"And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,\" John  Thornton said coolly.    \"Well,\" Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could  hear, \"I\\'ve got a thousand dollars that says he can\\'t. And there it  is.\" So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna  sausage down upon the bar.    Nobody spoke. Thornton\\'s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He  could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had  tricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand  pounds. Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great  faith in Buck\\'s strength and had often thought him capable of starting  such a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the  eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had  no thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.    \"I\\'ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of  flour on it,\" Matthewson went on with brutal directness; \"so don\\'t let  that hinder you.\"    Thornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from  face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of  thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it  going again. The face of Jim O\\'Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time  comrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him  to do what he would never have dreamed of doing.    \"Can you lend me a thousand?\" he asked, almost in a whisper.    \"Sure,\" answered O\\'Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of  Matthewson\\'s. \"Though it\\'s little faith I\\'m having, John, that the  beast can do the trick.\"    The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The  tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see  the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred  and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson\\'s  sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a  couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the  runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of  two to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose  concerning the phrase \"break out.\" O\\'Brien contended it was Thornton\\'s  privilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to \"break it out\"  from a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included  breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of  the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,  whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.    There were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.  Thornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now  that he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular  team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible  the task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.    \"Three to one!\" he proclaimed. \"I\\'ll lay you another thousand at that  figure, Thornton. What d\\'ye say?\"    Thornton\\'s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was  aroused-the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize  the impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He  called Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own  the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the  ebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid  it unhesitatingly against Matthewson\\'s six hundred.    The team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was  put into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and  he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.  Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in  perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one  hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit  and virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the  neck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half  bristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of  vigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and  heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the  body, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men  felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went  down to two to one.    \"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king  of the Skookum Benches. \"I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before  the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.\"    Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck\\'s side.    \"You must stand off from him,\" Matthewson protested. \"Free play and  plenty of room.\"    The crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers  vainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent  animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their  eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.    Thornton knelt down by Buck\\'s side. He took his head in his two hands  and rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his  wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. \"As you  love me, Buck. As you love me,\" was what he whispered. Buck whined with  suppressed eagerness.    The crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It  seemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his  mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and  releasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of  speech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.    \"Now, Buck,\" he said.    Buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several  inches. It was the way he had learned.    \"Gee!\" Thornton\\'s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.    Buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up  the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty  pounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp  crackling.    \"Haw!\" Thornton commanded.    Buck duplicated the man\\\\xc5\\\\x93uvre, this time to the left. The crackling  turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and  grating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were  holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.    \"Now, MUSH!\"    Thornton\\'s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself  forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was  gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles  writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great  chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet  were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in  parallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.  One of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled  lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it  never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two  inches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained  momentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.    Men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they  had ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck  with short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he  neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,  a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed  the firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself  loose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men  were shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a  general incoherent babel.    But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and  he was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him  cursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and  lovingly.    \"Gad, sir! Gad, sir!\" spluttered the Skookum Bench king. \"I\\'ll give you  a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir-twelve hundred, sir.\"    Thornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming  frankly down his cheeks. \"Sir,\" he said to the Skookum Bench king, \"no,  sir. You can go to hell, sir. It\\'s the best I can do for you, sir.\"    Buck seized Thornton\\'s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and  forth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back  to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to  interrupt.        Chapter VII. The Sounding of the Call    When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John  Thornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts  and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost  mine, the history of which was as old as the history of the country.  Many men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there  were who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped  in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The  oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning  there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to  it, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their  testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the  Northland.    But no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were  dead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a  dozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve  where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded  seventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,  passed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart  itself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked  the backbone of the continent.    John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the  wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the  wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.  Being in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course  of the day\\'s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he  kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he  would come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight  meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the  load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless  future.    To Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite  wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold  on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp,  here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through  frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat  of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted  riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of  hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted  across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in  slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.    The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the  uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the  Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,  shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber  line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming  gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and  flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall  of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where  wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of  life-only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered  places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.    And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of  men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the  forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the  path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the  man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another  time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and  amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled  flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days  in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins  packed flat, And that was all-no hint as to the man who in an early day  had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.    Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they  found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where  the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the  washing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them  thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every  day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag,  and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like  giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as  they heaped the treasure up.    There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now  and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the  fire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more  frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,  blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which  he remembered.    The salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the  hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands  clasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and  awakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness  and fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,  where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it  was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs  prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the  forest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man\\'s heels; and they  were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving  and nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as  Buck. The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as  fast as on the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb,  sometimes a dozen feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling,  never missing his grip. In fact, he seemed as much at home among the  trees as on the ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent  beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he  slept.    And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still  sounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest  and strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and  he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.  Sometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though  it were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood  might dictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or  into the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the  fat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment,  behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared  to all that moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that  he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not  know why he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and  did not reason about them at all.    Irresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing  lazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and  his ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet  and dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and  across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run  down dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the  woods. For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he  could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But  especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights,  listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading  signs and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious  something that called-called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him  to come.    One night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils  quivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the  forest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),  distinct and definite as never before,-a long-drawn howl, like, yet  unlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old  familiar way, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping  camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer  to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he  came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on  haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.    He had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense  his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered  compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted  care. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of  friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild  beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with  wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind  channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The  wolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe  and of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his  teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.    Buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with  friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made  three of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck\\'s shoulder.  Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time  and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in  poor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He  would run till Buck\\'s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl  around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.    But in the end Buck\\'s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding  that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they  became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with  which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the  wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was  going somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they  ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek  bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide  where it took its rise.    On the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level  country where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and  through these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the  sun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He  knew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood  brother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories  were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he  stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done  this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,  and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked  earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.    They stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck  remembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the  place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing  noses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned  about and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an  hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat  down, pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and  as Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter  until it was lost in the distance.    John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang  upon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon  him, licking his face, biting his hand-\"playing the general tom-fool,\"  as John Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and  forth and cursed him lovingly.    For two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of  his sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,  saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But  after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously  than ever. Buck\\'s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by  recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the  divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once  again he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no  more; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was  never raised.    He began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a  time; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went  down into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a week,  seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as  he travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never  to tire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere  into the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded  by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest  helpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the  last latent remnants of Buck\\'s ferocity. And two days later, when he  returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the  spoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two  behind who would quarrel no more.    The blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a  thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by  virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a  hostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this  he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated  itself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself in  all his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke  plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious  furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his  muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran  midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic  wolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father  he had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who  had given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf  muzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his  head, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.    His cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,  shepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus  an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable  a creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous animal living on  a straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his  life, overspilling with vigor and virility. When Thornton passed a  caressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the  hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. Every  part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most  exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect  equilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which  required action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as  a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could  leap twice as quickly. He saw the movement, or heard sound, and  responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere  seeing or hearing. He perceived and determined and responded in the  same instant. In point of fact the three actions of perceiving,  determining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were  the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His  muscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply,  like steel springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad  and rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer  ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world.    \"Never was there such a dog,\" said John Thornton one day, as the  partners watched Buck marching out of camp.    \"When he was made, the mould was broke,\" said Pete.    \"Py jingo! I t\\'ink so mineself,\" Hans affirmed.    They saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and  terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the  secrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing  of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that  appeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take  advantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like  a snake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest,  kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks  fleeing a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not  too quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He  killed to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he  killed himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was  his delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them,  to let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.    As the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater  abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less  rigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown  calf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and  he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band  of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,  and chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and,  standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist  as even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great  palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet  within the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,  while he roared with fury at sight of Buck.    From the bull\\'s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered  arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct  which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck  proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He  would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of  the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have  stamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the  fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of  rage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring  him on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus  separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would  charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.    There is a patience of the wild-dogged, tireless, persistent as life  itself-that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,  the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience  belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it  belonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its  march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their  half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.  For half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from  all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out  his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the  patience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that  of creatures preying.    As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest  (the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),  the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the  aid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them on  to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this  tireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of  the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only  one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,  and in the end they were content to pay the toll.    As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his  mates-the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he  had mastered-as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading  light. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless  fanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than  half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight  and struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature  whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.    From then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a  moment\\'s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the  shoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull  opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling  streams they crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long  stretches of flight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him,  but loped easily at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was  played, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely  when he strove to eat or drink.    The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the  shambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long  periods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and  Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to  rest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes  fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming  over the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the  moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.  Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The  news of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but  by some other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet  knew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange  things were afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he  had finished the business in hand.    At last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.  For a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping,  turn and turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his  face toward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope,  and went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way,  heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of  direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame.    As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the  land. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had  been there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon  him in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the  squirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several  times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs,  reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed. He was  oppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity  already happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down  into the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.    Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair  rippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.  Buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and  tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story-all but  the end. His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the  life on the heels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant  silence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in  hiding. One only he saw,-a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray  dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the  wood itself.    As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose  was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped  and pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.  He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow  protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.    A hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs  Thornton had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a  death-struggle, directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him  without stopping. From the camp came the faint sound of many voices,  rising and falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge  of the clearing, he found Hans, lying on his face, feathered with  arrows like a porcupine. At the same instant Buck peered out where the  spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up  on his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him.  He did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible  ferocity. For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp  cunning and reason, and it was because of his great love for John  Thornton that he lost his head.    The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge  when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal  the like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live  hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He  sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping  the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.  He did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the  next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was no  withstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,  rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the  arrows they discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his  movements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they  shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear  at Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with  such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood  out beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to  the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.    And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and  dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was a  fateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the  country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the  survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.  As for Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated  camp. He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the  first moment of surprise. Thornton\\'s desperate struggle was  fresh-written on the earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to  the edge of a deep pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water,  lay Skeet, faithful to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored  from the sluice boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it  contained John Thornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water,  from which no trace led away.    All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.  Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the  lives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It  left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which  ached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he  paused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain  of it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,-a  pride greater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the  noblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club  and fang. He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It  was harder to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all,  were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he  would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their  arrows, spears, and clubs.    Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,  lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the  coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became  alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which  the Yeehats had made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far  away drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp  yelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again  Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in  his memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It  was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and  compellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to  obey. John Thornton was dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the  claims of man no longer bound him.    Hunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the  flanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over  from the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck\\'s valley. Into the  clearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood;  and in the centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue,  waiting their coming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and  a moment\\'s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him.  Like a flash Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without  movement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.  Three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they  drew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.    This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded  together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.  Buck\\'s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.  Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere  at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly  did he whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from  getting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the  creek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He worked  along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course  of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides  and with nothing to do but face the front.    And so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves  drew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the  white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying  down with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their  feet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool.  One wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly  manner, and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a  night and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they  touched noses.    Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed  his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,  Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke  out the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the  call came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down and  howled. This over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around  him, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted  the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung  in behind, yelping in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with  the wild brother, yelping as he ran.      And here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when  the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were  seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of  white centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the  Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are  afraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they,  stealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps,  slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.    Nay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the  camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with  throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the  snow greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats  follow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they  never enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over  the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an  abiding-place.    In the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which  the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,  and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling  timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a  yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the  ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould  overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses  for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.    But he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the  wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running  at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering  borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow  as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.
