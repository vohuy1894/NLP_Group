I was approaching\r\nfifteen, Mary was about a year younger, and Eliza between twelve and\r\nthirteen years of age. Mamma treated us all as children, and was blind\r\nto the fact that I was no longer what I had been. Although not tall for\r\nmy age, nor outwardly presenting a manly appearance, my passions were\r\nawakening, and the distinctive feature of my sex, although in repose it\r\nlooked magnificent enough, was very sufficiently developed when under\r\nthe influence of feminine excitement.\r\n\r\nAs yet, I had absolutely no knowledge of the uses of the different\r\norgans of sex. My sisters and I all slept in the same room. They\r\ntogether in one bed, I alone in another. When no one was present, we had\r\noften mutually examined the different formations of our sexes.\r\n\r\nWe had discovered that mutual handlings gave a certain amount of\r\npleasing sensation; and, latterly, my eldest sister had discovered that\r\nthe hooding and unhooding of my doodle, as she called it, instantly\r\ncaused it to swell up and stiffen as hard as a piece of wood. My feeling\r\nof her little pinky slit gave rise in her to nice sensations, but on the\r\nslightest attempt to insert even my finger, the pain was too great. We\r\nhad made so little progress in the _attouchements_ that not the\r\nslightest inkling of what could be done in that way dawned upon us. I\r\nhad begun to develop a slight growth of moss-like curls round the root\r\nof my cock; and then, to our surprise, Mary began to show a similar\r\ntendency. As yet, Eliza was as bald as her hand, but both were prettily\r\nformed, with wonderfully full and fat mounts of Venus. We were perfectly\r\ninnocent of guile and quite habituated to let each other look at all our\r\nnaked bodies without the slightest hesitation; and when playing in the\r\ngarden, if one wanted to relieve the pressure on the bladder, we all\r\nsquatted down together, and crossed waters, each trying who could piddle\r\nfastest. Notwithstanding these symptoms of passion when excited, in a\r\nstate of calm I might have passed for a boy of ten or eleven.\r\n\r\nMy father had left us but moderately provided for, and mamma, wishing to\r\nlive comfortably, preferred giving me lessons along with my sisters at\r\nhome to sending me to school; but her health beginning to fail, she\r\ninserted an advertisement in the _Times_ for a governess. Out of a large\r\nnumber of applicants, a young lady, of the name of Evelyn, was selected.\r\nSome ten days afterwards she arrived, and became one of the family.\r\n\r\nWe did not see much of her the first evening, but after breakfast the\r\nfollowing morning, mamma accompanied her to what was considered our\r\nschoolroom, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dears, I place you under Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncare; you must obey her in all things; she will teach you your lessons,\r\nas I am unable to do so any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning to our new governess,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear you will find them somewhat spoiled, and unruly; but there is a\r\nhorse, and Susan will make you excellent birch rods whenever you require\r\nthem. If you spare their bottoms when they deserve whipping, you will\r\nseriously offend me.\xe2\x80\x9d As mamma said this, I observed Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nappeared to dilate with a sort of joy, and I felt certain that, severely\r\nas mamma had often whipped us, if we should now deserve it, Miss Evelyn\r\nwould administer it much more severely. She looked amiability itself,\r\nand was truly beautiful in face and person, twenty-two years of age,\r\nfull and finely formed, and dressed always with the most studied\r\nneatness. She was, in truth, a seductive creature. She made an\r\ninstantaneous impression on my senses. There was, however, somewhat of a\r\nsternness of expression, and a dignity of carriage, which caused at once\r\nto fear and respect her. Of course, at first, all went smoothly enough,\r\nand seeing that mamma treated me precisely as she did my sisters, I came\r\nto be regarded as quite a child by Miss Evelyn. She found that she had\r\nto sleep in the same room with my sisters and myself. I fancied that on\r\nthe first night Miss Evelyn did not approve of this arrangement, but\r\ngradually became familiarized with it, and seemed to think no more about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen bedtime came, we all kissed mamma and retired early, as usual. Miss\r\nEvelyn followed some hours later. When she came in, she carefully locked\r\nthe door, then looked at me to see if I was asleep. Why, I know not, but\r\nI was instinctively prompted to feign sleep. I did so successfully,\r\nnotwithstanding the passing of the candle before my eyes. So she at once\r\ncommenced undressing. When her back was turned, I opened my eyes, and\r\ngreedily devoured her naked charms as they were gradually exhibited\r\nbefore me. The moment she turned round, I was again as if asleep. I have\r\nsaid that my passions had begun to develop themselves, but as yet I did\r\nnot understand their force or direction. I well remember this first\r\nnight, when a fine ripe woman gradually removed every particle of dress\r\nwithin a couple of yards of me\xe2\x80\x94the effect of each succeeding charm, from\r\nher lovely and beautifully formed bubbies to the taking off her shoes\r\nand stockings from her well-formed legs and small feet and ankles,\r\ncaused my prick to swell and stiffen to a painful extent. When all but\r\nher chemise was removed, she stopped to pick up her petticoats that she\r\nhad allowed to fall to her feet, and in lifting them, raised also her\r\nchemise, and exposed to my view a most glorious bottom\xe2\x80\x94dazzlingly white\r\nand shining like satin. As the light was full upon it, and she was still\r\nin a stooping position, I could see that below her slit she was well\r\ncovered with dark hair. Turning round, to put her petticoats on a chair,\r\nand to take up her nightgown, she slipped her chemise from her arm, and\r\nletting it fall to the ground while she lifted the nightgown over her\r\nhead, I had for some seconds a view of her beautiful belly, thickly\r\ncovered with dark curly hair over the mount of Venus. So voluptuous was\r\nthe sight, I almost shuddered, so intense was my excitement. She now sat\r\ndown on the bed to take off her shoes and stockings. Oh! what beautiful\r\nthighs, legs, ankles, and feet she had!\r\n\r\nI am now advanced in life, and have had many handsome and well-formed\r\nwomen, but I never saw limbs more voluptuously formed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the light was extinguished, and a rushing rill flowed\r\ninto the night vase; very different from the gentle tricklings from\r\nmyself and sisters as we often squatted down opposite each other and\r\ncrossed water, laughing at the different sources from which they flowed.\r\nMy sisters often envied me the power of directing the spurt where I\r\npleased, so little were we from dreaming of the real intent of that\r\nprojecting little instrument.\r\n\r\nI heard the charming creature get into bed, and shortly breathe hard. As\r\nfor me, I could not sleep. I lay awake the greater part of the night,\r\nafraid to be restless, lest I should disturb Miss Evelyn and give her\r\nreason to think I had been observant of her undressing. When at last I\r\ndozed off, it was but to dream of all the charms I had seen.\r\n\r\nAbout a month passed thus. Every night Miss Evelyn became more and more\r\nat her ease, and confident of my mere childishness, often gave me\r\nglorious and lengthened glimpses of her beautifully developed charms:\r\nalthough it was only about every other night that I could enjoy them,\r\nfor, as they always produced sleeplessness afterwards, the following\r\nnight nature assured her rights, and I usually slept profoundly when I\r\nwould have preferred continued gazing on the charms of my lovely\r\ngoverness. But, doubtless, those exhausting sleeps helped to throw her\r\noff her guard, and gave me better opportunities than I should otherwise\r\nhave had. Once or twice she used the night ware before putting on her\r\nnightgown, and I could see the rosy-lipped opening embosomed in\r\nexquisite dark curls, pouring out its full measure of water; showing a\r\nfine force of nature, and driving me wild with excitement. Yet it is\r\nsingular that I never once thought of applying to my fingers for relief\r\nfrom the painful stiffness that nearly burst my prick asunder.\r\n\r\nWhether mamma had observed my very frequent projection of my trousers,\r\nor began to think it better I should not sleep in the same room as Miss\r\nEvelyn, I cannot say, but she had my bed removed into her own. However,\r\nI was so thoroughly treated as a mere boy by everyone in the house, that\r\nMiss Evelyn seemed to forget my sex; and there was at all times a\r\nfreedom of carriage and an _abandon_ in her attitudes that she certainly\r\nwould not have indulged in if she had felt any restraint from\r\nconsidering herself in the presence of a youth of the age of puberty.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather I used to sit on a low stool by the fire\xe2\x80\x94Miss Evelyn was\r\nseated in front, I had my lesson book on my knee, and she herself would\r\nplace her beautiful feet on the high school fender, with her work in her\r\nlap, while she heard my sisters repeat their lesson, totally unconscious\r\nthat for half an hour at a time she was exposing her beautiful legs and\r\nthighs to my ardent gaze; for sitting much below her, and bending my\r\nhead as if intent on my lesson, my eyes were below her raised\r\npetticoats. Her close and tight-fitting white stockings displayed her\r\nwell-formed legs, for while confined to the house during our morning\r\nlessons she did not wear drawers; so that in the position she sat in,\r\nwith her knees higher than her feet on the already high fender, and her\r\nlegs somewhat apart to hold her work in her lap more easily, the whole\r\nglorious underswell of both thighs, and the lower part of her fine large\r\nbottom, with the pinky slit quite visible, nestled in a rich profusion\r\nof dark curls, were fully exposed to my view. The light from the fire\r\nglancing under her raised petticoats tinged the whole with a glow, and\r\nset me equally in a blaze of desire until I was almost ready to faint. I\r\ncould have rushed headlong under her petticoats, and kissed and fondled\r\nthat delicious opening and all its surroundings. Oh, how little she\r\nthought of the passion she was raising. Oh! dear Miss Evelyn, how I did\r\nlove you from the dainty kid slipper and tight glossy silk stocking, up\r\nto the glorious swell of the beautiful bubbies, that were so fully\r\nexposed to me nearly every night, and the lovely lips of all that I\r\nlonged to lovingly embrace.\r\n\r\nThus day after day passed away, and Miss Evelyn became to me a goddess,\r\na creature whom, in my heart of hearts, I literally worshiped. When she\r\nleft the schoolroom, and I was alone, I kissed that part of the fender\r\nher feet had pressed, and the seat on which she sat, and even the air an\r\ninch above, imagination placing there her lovely cunt. I craved for\r\nsomething beyond this without knowing exactly what I wanted; for, as\r\nyet, I really was utterly ignorant of anything appertaining to the\r\nconjunction of the sexes.\r\n\r\nOne day I had gone up to my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 bedroom where the governess slept,\r\nthat I might throw myself on her bed, and in imagination embrace her\r\nbeautiful body. I heard someone approaching, and knowing that I had no\r\nbusiness there, I hid myself under the bed. The next moment Miss Evelyn\r\nherself entered, and locked the door. It was about an hour before\r\ndinner. Taking off her dress, and hanging it on the wardrobe, she drew\r\nout a piece of furniture, which had been bought for her, the use of\r\nwhich had often puzzled me; she took off the lid, poured water into its\r\nbasin, and placed a sponge near it. She then took off her gown, drew her\r\npetticoats and chemise up to her waist and fastened them there,\r\nstraddled across it, and seated herself upon it.\r\n\r\nI thus had the intoxicating delight of gazing on all her beautiful\r\ncharms, for when she tucked up her clothes she stood before her glass,\r\npresenting to my devouring glance her glorious white bottom in all its\r\nfullness, turning to approach the bidet, she equally exposed her lower\r\nbelly and beautiful mount, with all its wealth of hair. While straddling\r\nover the bidet before she sat down, the whole of her pinky-lipped cunt\r\nbroke on my enraptured sight. Never shall I forget the wild excitement\r\nof the moment. It was almost too much for my excited senses;\r\nfortunately, when seated, the immediate cause of my almost madness\r\nvanished. She sponged herself well between the thighs for about five\r\nminutes. She then raised herself off the bidet, and for a moment again\r\ndisplayed the pouting lips of her cunt\xe2\x80\x94then stood fronting me for two or\r\nthree minutes while she removed, with the rinsed sponge, the trickling\r\ndrops of water which still gathered on the rich bush of curls around her\r\nquim. Thus her belly, mount and thighs, whose massy-fleshed and most\r\nvoluptuous shape were more fully seen by me than they had heretofore\r\nbeen, and it may easily be conceived into what a state such a deliberate\r\nview threw me.\r\n\r\nOh, Miss Evelyn, dear, delicious Miss Evelyn! what would you have\r\nthought had you known that I was gazing on all your angelic charms, and\r\nthat my eager eyes had been straining themselves to penetrate the\r\nrichness of those charming pouting lips which lay so snugly in that rich\r\nmass of dark curling hair. Oh! how I do long to kiss them; for at that\r\ntime I had no other idea of embracing and still less of penetrating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen her ablutions were completed, she sat down and drew off her\r\nstockings, displaying her beautiful white calves and charming little\r\nfeet. I believe it was this first admiration of really exquisitely\r\nformed legs, ankles and feet, which were extraordinarily perfect in\r\nmake, that first awakened my passion for those objects, which have since\r\nalways exercised a peculiar charm over me. She was also so particularly\r\nneat in her shoes\xe2\x80\x94little dark ones\xe2\x80\x94that were _bijoux_ to look at, I\r\noften took them up and kissed them, when left in the room. Then her silk\r\nstockings, always drawn up tight and fitting like a glove, set off to\r\nthe greatest advantage the remarkable fine shape of her legs.\r\n\r\nPutting on silk for cotton stockings, she took down a low-bodiced dress,\r\nfinished her toilet, and left the room. I crawled out from under the\r\nbed, washed my face and hands in the water of the bidet, and even drank\r\nsome in my excitement.\r\n\r\nSome six weeks had now elapsed since the arrival of Miss Evelyn. The\r\npassion that had seized me for her had so far kept me most obedient to\r\nher slightest command, or even wish, and, from the same cause, attentive\r\nto my lessons, when not distracted by the circumstances already\r\ndetailed. My example had also had the effect of keeping my sisters much\r\nin the same groove, but it was impossible this could last\xe2\x80\x94it was not\r\nnature. As long as all went smoothly, Miss Evelyn seemed to be all\r\namiability. We fancied we could do as we liked, and we grew more\r\ncareless.\r\n\r\nMiss Evelyn became more reserved, and cautioned us at first, and then\r\nthreatened us with the rod. We did not think she would make use of it.\r\nMary grew impertinent, and one afternoon turned sulky over her lessons,\r\nand set our teacher at defiance. Miss Evelyn, who had been growing more\r\nand more angry, had her rise from her seat. She obeyed with an impudent\r\nleer. Seizing her by the arm, Miss Evelyn dragged the struggling girl to\r\nthe horse. My sister was strong and fought hard, using both teeth and\r\nnails, but it was to no purpose. The anger of our governess was fully\r\nroused, and raising her in her arms, she carried her forcibly to the\r\nhorse, placed her on it, held her firmly with one hand while she put the\r\nnoose round her with the other, which, when drawn, secured her body;\r\nother nooses secured each ankle to rings in the floor, keeping her legs\r\napart by the projection of the horse, and also forcing the knees to bend\r\na little, by which the most complete exposure of the bottom, and, in\r\nfact, of all her private parts too, was obtained.\r\n\r\nMiss Evelyn then left her, and went to mamma for a rod. In a few minutes\r\nshe returned, evidently flushed with passion, and proceded to tie Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npetticoats well up to her waist, leaving her bottom and her pinky slit\r\nquite bare and exposed directly before my eyes. It was quite two months\r\nsince I had seen her private parts, and I was well surprised to observe\r\nthe lips more pouting and swelled out, as well as the symptoms of a\r\nmossy covering of the mount much more developed. Indeed, it was in\r\nitself more exciting than I had expected, for my thoughts had so long\r\ndwelt only on the riper beauties of Miss Evelyn that I had quite ceased\r\nto have any toying with Mary.\r\n\r\nThis full view of all her private parts reawakened former sensations and\r\nstrengthened them. Miss Evelyn first removed her own scarf, laying bare\r\nher plump ivory shoulders, and showing the upper halves of her beautiful\r\nbubbies, which were heaving with the excitement of her anger. She bared\r\nher fine right arm, and grasping the rod, stepped back and raised her\r\narm; her eyes glistened in a peculiar way. She was indeed beautiful to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that moment\xe2\x80\x94it was but a moment. The rod whistled\r\nthrough the air and fell with a cruel cut on poor Mary\xe2\x80\x99s plump little\r\nbottom. The flesh quivered again, and Mary, who had resolved not to cry,\r\nflushed in her face, and bit the damask with which the horse was\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\nAgain the arm was raised, and again, with a sharp whistle, it fell on\r\nthe palpating buttocks below it. Still her stubborn temper bore her up,\r\nand although we saw how she winced, not a sound escaped her lips.\r\nDrawing back a step, Miss Evelyn again raised her hand and arm, and this\r\ntime her aim was so true that the longer points of the rod doubled\r\nbetween the buttocks and concentrated themselves between the lips of\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s privates. So agonising was the pain that she screamed out\r\ndreadfully. Again the rod fell precisely on the same spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! oh! Dear Miss Evelyn. I will never, no, never, do so again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer shrieks were of no avail. Cut succeeded cut, yell succeeded\r\nyell\xe2\x80\x94until the rod was worn to a stump, and poor Mary\xe2\x80\x99s bottom was one\r\nmass of weals and red as raw beef. It was fearful to see, and yet such\r\nis our nature that to see it was, at the same time, exciting. I could\r\nnot keep my eyes from her pouting quim, the swelling lips of which,\r\nunder the severity of the punishment it was undergoing, not only seemed\r\nto thicken, but actually opened and shut, and evidently throbbed with\r\nagony. But all this was highly exciting for me to witness. I then and\r\nthere resolved to have a closer inspection at a more convenient\r\nopportunity, which did not fail me in the end.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her spirit was completely cowed, or rather, crushed. Indeed,\r\nwe were all fully frightened, and now knew what we had to expect, if we\r\ndid not behave ourselves. There was now no fear of any manifestation of\r\ntemper, and we felt we must indeed obey implicitly whatever our\r\ngoverness chose to order. We instinctively learned to fear her.\r\n\r\nA very few days after this memorable whipping, some visitors arrived\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngentleman and lady. The gentleman was an old friend of mamma\xe2\x80\x99s, who had\r\nlately married, and mamma had asked them to visit her on their wedding\r\ntour and spent a short time with us.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was a fine-looking man, tall and powerfully built; the\r\nlady rather delicate looking, but well shaped, with good breasts and\r\nshoulders, small waist, and spreading haunches, well-formed arms, small\r\nhands and feet, and very brilliant eyes.\r\n\r\nI think it was about three days after their arrival that one afternoon I\r\nwent into the spare room, which was occupied by these visitors; while\r\nthere, I heard them coming upstairs. The lady entered first, and I had\r\njust time to slip into a closet and draw the door to; it was not quite\r\nclosed, but nearly so. In a minute the gentleman followed, and gently\r\nshutting the door, locked it. Mrs. Benson smiled, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my love, you are a sad teaser; you let me have no rest. Surely,\r\nyou had enough last night and this morning without wanting it again so\r\nsoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I had not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never can have enough of your delicious\r\nperson. So come, we must not be long about it, or our absence will be\r\nobserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her round the waist, and drew her lips to his, and gave her a\r\nlong, long kiss; squeezing her to him, and moving himself against her.\r\nThen seating himself, he pulled her on his knee, and thrust his hand up\r\nher petticoats, their mouths being glued together for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be quick, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nHe got up, and lifted her on the edge of the bed, threw her back, and\r\ntaking her legs under his arms, exposed everything to my view. She had\r\nnot so much hair on her mount of Venus as Miss Evelyn, but her slit\r\nshowed more pouting lips, and appeared more open. Judge of my excitement\r\nwhen I saw Mr. Benson unbutton his trousers and pull out an immense\r\ncock. Oh, dear, how large it looked; it almost frightened me. With his\r\nfingers he placed the head between the lips of Mrs. Benson\xe2\x80\x99s sheath, and\r\nthen letting go his hold, and placing both arms so as to support her\r\nlegs, he pushed it all right into her to the hilt at once. I was\r\nthunderstruck that Mrs. Benson did not shriek with agony, it did seem\r\nsuch a large thing to thrust right into her belly. However, far from\r\nscreaming with pain, she appeared to enjoy it. Her eyes glistened, her\r\nface flushed, and she smiled most graciously on Mr. B. The two appeared\r\nvery happy. His large cock slipped in and out quite smoothly, and his\r\nhands pressed the large glossy buttocks and pulled them to him at each\r\nhome thrust. This lasted nearly five minutes, when all at once Mr. B.\r\nstopped short, and then followed one or two convulsive shoves\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ngrinning in a very absurd way at her. He remained quiet for a few\r\nminutes, and then drew out his cock, all soft, with slimy drops falling\r\nfrom it onto the carpet. Taking a towel, he wiped up the carpet, and\r\nwrapping it round his cock, went to the basin and washed it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Benson lay for a few minutes longer all exposed, her quim more open\r\nthan before, and I could see a white slime oozing from it.\r\n\r\nYou can hardly imagine the wild excitement this scene occasioned me.\r\nFirst, the grand mystery was at once explained to me, and my ignorant\r\nlongings now knew to what they tended. After giving me plenty of time to\r\nrealise all the beauties of her private parts, she slipped down on the\r\nfloor, adjusted her petticoats, and smoothed the disordered counterpane,\r\nand then went to the glass to arrange her hair. This done, she quietly\r\nunlocked the door, and Mr. Benson went out. The door was then relocked,\r\nand Mrs. B. went to the basin, emptied and filled it, then raised up her\r\npetticoats, and bathed the parts between her legs with a sponge, and\r\nthen rubbed all dry with a towel; all this time exposing everything to\r\nmy ardent gaze. But, horror of horrors! she after this came straight to\r\nthe closet and gave a slight scream on discovering me there. I blushed\r\nup to the ears, and tried to stammer out an excuse. She stared at me at\r\nfirst in silent amazement; but at last said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came you here, sir, tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was here when you came up; I wanted my football, which was in this\r\ncloset, and when I heard you coming, I hid myself, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some minutes she seemed to consider and examine me attentively. She\r\nthen said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you be discreet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never tell anyone what you have seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, keep this promise, and I shall try what I can do to reward you.\r\nNow, go downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went to the schoolroom, but I was greatly agitated, I scarcely knew\r\nwhat I was doing. The scene I had witnessed had complete possession of\r\nmy thoughts. In years but a boy, the mystery now practically explained\r\nto me had awakened all the passions of a man. Instead of studying my\r\nlessons, my thoughts wandered to Mrs. B., thrown back on the bed with\r\nher fine legs and thighs fully exposed; above all, the sight of the\r\npinky gash, with its fleecy hair at the bottom of her belly, which I had\r\nseen for some minutes all open and oozing out the slimy juice that\r\nfollowed the amorous encounter they had been indulging in. It seemed so\r\nmuch more developed than Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s. I felt sure that Miss Evelyn\r\ncould never take in such a thick long thing as Mr. B. had thrust into\r\nhis wife, and yet it appeared to go in so easily, and moved about so\r\nsmoothly, and so evidently to the satisfaction and utmost delight of\r\nboth, as was proved by their ardent embracings, fond murmurs, and\r\nvoluptuous movements, especially just before they both ceased together\r\nall movement whatever.\r\n\r\nThen I thought, how delicious it would be to treat Miss Evelyn in the\r\nsame way, and to revel with my stiff-standing prick in her delicious\r\nquim, which in my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye I saw before me as I had viewed it on her\r\nrising from the bidet, when I lay hid under the bed. Then I thought of\r\nmy sister Mary\xe2\x80\x99s smaller, although attractive little quim, and I\r\nresolved, as that was the easiest to get hold of, to initiate her in all\r\nthe newly discovered mysteries. I fully determined that my own first\r\nlesson, as well as hers, should be taken on her little fat chubby cunt.\r\nThen the recollection of its pouting and throbbing lips under the\r\nfearful flagellation she had undergone, began to excite me, and made my\r\ncock stand stiff and throb again. All the weeks of excitement I had now\r\nconstantly been under had produced a wonderful effect on my pego, which\r\nhad become considerably more developed when in a state of erection. As\r\nyou may suppose, with such distracting thoughts, I did not get on with\r\nmy lessons. Miss Evelyn, for some reason or other, was out of humour\r\nthat morning, and more than once spoke crossly to me for my evident\r\ninattention. At length she called me to her, and finding that I had\r\nscarcely done anything, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Charles, I give you ten minutes longer to finish that sum, if not\r\ndone in that time I shall whip you; you are exhibiting the mere spirit\r\nof idleness. I do not know what has come over you, but if persisted in,\r\nyou shall certainly be punished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea of the beautiful Miss Evelyn whipping my bare bottom did not\r\ntend to calm my excitement, on the contrary, it turned my lewd thoughts\r\nupon the beauties of her person, which I had so often furtively gazed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at which hour we always broke up for a\r\nrun in the garden for an hour, and during this period I had resolved to\r\nbegin instructing Mary in the secret mysteries I had so lately been a\r\nwitness to. But fate had ordered it otherwise, and I was to receive my\r\nfirst practical lesson and be initiated on the person of a riper and\r\nmore beautiful woman; but of this hereafter. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock I had done\r\nnothing with my task\xe2\x80\x94Miss Evelyn looked grave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary and Eliza, you may go out, Charles will remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sisters, simply imagining that I was kept to finish my lessons, ran\r\ninto the garden. Miss Evelyn turned the key in the door, opened a\r\ncupboard, and withdrew a birch rod neatly tied up with blue ribbons. Now\r\nmy blood coursed through my veins, and my fingers trembled so that I\r\ncould hardly hold my pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut down your slate, Charles, and come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and stood before my beautiful governess, with a strange\r\ncommixture of fear and desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfasten your braces, and pull down your trousers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI commenced doing this, though but very slowly. Angry at my delay her\r\ndelicate fingers speedily accomplished the work. My trousers fell to my\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace yourself across my knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTremblingly, with the same commixture of feeling, I obeyed. Her silk\r\ndress was drawn up to prevent its being creased\xe2\x80\x94my naked flesh pressed\r\nagainst her snowy white petticoats. A delicate perfume of violet and\r\nvervain assailed my nerves. As I felt her soft and delicate fingers\r\ndrawing up my shirt, and passing over my bare posteriors, while the\r\nwarmth of her pulpy form beneath me penetrated my flesh, nature exerted\r\nher power, and my prick began to swell out to a most painful extent. I\r\nhad but little time, however, to notice this before a rapid succession\r\nof the most cruel cuts lacerated my bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, Miss Evelyn. I will do the sum if you\r\nwill only forgive me. Oh, oh, oh, &amp;c.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolding me firmly with her left arm, Miss Evelyn used the rod most\r\nunmercifully. At first, the pain was excruciating, and I roared out as\r\nloud as I could, but gradually the pain ceased to be so acute, and was\r\nsucceeded by the most delicious tickling sensation. My struggles at\r\nfirst had been so violent as to greatly disorder Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npetticoats, and to raise them up so as to expose to my delighted eyes\r\nher beautifully formed silk-clad legs up to the knees, and even an inch\r\nor two of naked thigh above.\r\n\r\nThis, together with the intense tickling irritation communicated to my\r\nbottom, as well as to the friction of my cock against the person of Miss\r\nEvelyn in my struggles, rendered me almost delirious, and I tossed and\r\npushed myself about on her knees in a state of perfect frenzy as the\r\nblows continued to be showered down upon my poor bottom. At last the rod\r\nwas worn to a stump, and I was pushed off her knees. As I rose before\r\nher, with my cheeks streaming with tears, my shirt was jutting out\r\nconsiderably in front in an unmistakable and most prominent manner, and\r\nmy prick was at the same time throbbing beneath it with convulsive\r\njerks, which I could by no means restrain.\r\n\r\nMiss Evelyn glared at the projection in marked astonishment, and her\r\nopen eyes were fixed upon it as I stood rubbing my bottom and crying,\r\nwithout attempting to move or button up my trousers. She continued for\r\na minute or two to stare at the object of attraction, flushing scarlet\r\nup to the forehead, and then she suddenly seemed to recollect herself,\r\ndrew a heavy breath, and rapidly left the room. She did not return\r\nuntil after my sisters came back from the garden, and seemed still\r\nconfused, and avoided fixing her eye upon me.\r\n\r\nIn two days afterwards, all disagreeable marks of this very severe\r\nwhipping had disappeared. On the following day we were invited to pass\r\nthe afternoon at the grange, a beautiful place about two miles from us.\r\nThe afternoon was fine and warm; we walked there, and arrived about four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson were in the drawing room, but at once\r\ndesired us to go in the garden and amuse ourselves with their three\r\ndaughters, whom we would find there. We went at once, and found them\r\namusing themselves on a swing. Sophia, the eldest, about nineteen, was\r\nswinging a sister about two years younger, a very fine, fully developed\r\nyoung woman. Indeed, all three sisters were finer women and more\r\nbeautiful than the average of young ladies.\r\n\r\nAnother sister, Agnes, was not seated, but standing on the board between\r\nthe ropes. Sophia was making both mount as high as possible. They were\r\nlaughing loudly, when we found them, at the exposure each made\xe2\x80\x94one in\r\nadvancing, the other retiring. Agnes\xe2\x80\x99s light dress of muslin and single\r\npetticoat, as she retired and the wind came up from behind, was bulged\r\nout in front, and exposed her limbs up to her belly, so that one could\r\nsee that her mount was already well furnished. The other, in advancing,\r\nthrew her legs up, and exposed all the underside of her thighs and a\r\npart of her bottom, and you could just discern that there was dark hair\r\nbetween the lower thighs and bottom.\r\n\r\nAs they considered me but a child, I was no check to their mirth and\r\nsport. On the contrary, they gave me a long rope to pull down the swing\r\nwhen at its highest, and I sat down on the grass in front for greater\r\nconvenience. The fine limbs and hairy quims exposed freely before me\r\nfrom moment to moment excited my passions. None of them wore more than\r\none petticoat, and they had no drawers, so that when they mounted to the\r\nhighest point from me, I had the fullest possible view of all. My cock\r\nsoon rose to a painful extent, which I really believe was noticed and\r\nenjoyed by them, I observed, too, that I was an object of attention to\r\nMiss Evelyn, who shortly seated herself in the swing, and allowed me to\r\nswing her with the end of the rope. I even fancied that she threw up her\r\nlegs more than was at all necessary; at all events, she naturally, with\r\nthe strong feelings I had towards her, excited me more than all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWe were as merry as could be, and we passed a delightful evening until\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when it began to rain. As it continued, and became very\r\nheavy, Mr. Robinson ordered out the closed carriage to take us home. It\r\nwas a brougham, only seated for two. Mary took Eliza on her knee, Miss\r\nEvelyn took me upon hers. I know not how it happened, but her lovely arm\r\nsoon passed round my body as if to hold me on her knee, and her hand\r\nfell, apparently by accident, exactly on my cock\xe2\x80\x94the touch was electric.\r\nIn an instant, my member stood stiff and strong beneath her hand. Still\r\nMiss Evelyn, who must have felt the movement going on beneath her\r\nfingers, did not remove her hand, but rather seemed to press more upon\r\nit. In my boyish ignorance, I imagined she was not aware of what was\r\nhappening. The motion and jolting of the carriage over rough road caused\r\nher hand to rub up and down upon my erected and throbbing member. I was\r\nalmost beside myself, and to conceal my condition I feigned sleep. I let\r\nmy head fall on Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and neck\xe2\x80\x94she allowed this.\r\n\r\nWhether she thought I had really fallen asleep I know not, but I was\r\nquite sensible that her fingers pressed my swollen and throbbing cock,\r\nand I fancied she was measuring its size.\r\n\r\nThe tight grasp she managed to gain, and the continued jolting of the\r\ncarriage, brought me up at last to such a pitch state that a greater\r\njolt than usual, repeated two or three times in succession, each\r\nfollowed by a firmer pressure of her charming fingers, caused me such an\r\nexcess of excitement that I actually swooned away with the most\r\ndelicious sensation I had ever experienced in my life. I was some time\r\nbefore I knew where I was, or what I was about, and was only made\r\nconscious of our arrival at home by Miss Evelyn shaking me to rouse me\r\nup. I stumbled up, but though partially stupefied, I fancied Miss\r\nEvelyn\xe2\x80\x99s eyes shone with a brilliancy I had never before observed, and\r\nthat there was a bright hectic flush on her cheek. She refused to go\r\ninto the parlour, but hurried to bed on pretence of a headache.\r\n\r\nWhen I retired to bed, and took off my shirt, I found it all sticky and\r\nwet in front.\r\n\r\nIt was thus I paid down my first tribute to Venus. I thought long over\r\nthis evident approach to familiarity on the part of Miss Evelyn, and\r\nwent to sleep with a lively hope of a more private interview with her,\r\nwhen I trusted that her evident passion would initiate me in the\r\npleasures to be derived from her beauteous body.\r\n\r\nBut again fate intervened, and another, not less beautiful, more\r\nexperienced, and more inclined for the sport, was to be my charming\r\nmistress in love\xe2\x80\x99s revels.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, Mr. Benson was unexpectedly called away on pressing\r\naffairs, which he feared might detain him three weeks. He left Mrs. B.\r\nwith us. As he had to be driven about nine miles to the town where the\r\ncoach passed, mamma took the opportunity of going to the town with him.\r\nMrs. B. complained of not being equal to the fatigue, and mamma told\r\nMiss Evelyn she would like her company, and as the two girls wanted new\r\nshoes, they could go also; I was to remain at home, and mamma desired me\r\nto be quiet and attentive to Mrs. Benson, who, observing no one, said to\r\nme, with a peculiar look:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall want you to hold my skeins, Charlie, so don\xe2\x80\x99t go out of the\r\nway, but be ready for me as soon as they are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then went up to her bedroom, where Mr. B. immediately joined her, no\r\ndoubt to re-enact the scene I had already witnessed from the closet on a\r\nprevious day. They were fully half an hour occupied together. At length,\r\nall was ready, and off they went, leaving me to a fate I had little\r\ndreamt of.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. proposed we should go up to the drawing room, which looked out\r\nto the garden, and was nowhere overlooked. I followed her, and could not\r\nhelp admiring her fine figure as she preceded me in going upstairs.\r\nAlthough pale in complexion, she was well made, and very elegant in her\r\ncarriage, and sat down on a low easy chair, throwing herself completely\r\nback, and crossing one leg over the other, apparently without being\r\naware that she carried her petticoats up with the action, and exhibited\r\nthe beautiful underleg up to the garter.\r\n\r\nI had never forgotten the day, when secreted in the closet, I had seen\r\nthem completely exposed, and how charming they were. Her present\r\nnegligent attitude, although far from the same exposure I speak of, was\r\nstill, with the former recollection running in my head, enough to set my\r\nwhole blood on fire. I have before remarked what a power beautiful and\r\nwell-stockinged legs, and ankles and small feet, had upon my nervous\r\nsystem, and so it was now. As I gazed upon her handsome legs, ankles,\r\nand feet, I felt my prick swell and throb in a manner that could not\r\nfail to be perceptible to Mrs. B, especially as her head lay on a level\r\nwith that part of my person as I stood before her.\r\n\r\nAlthough she continued knitting, I could see that her eyes were directed\r\nto that part of my person, and fixed upon the increasing distention of\r\nmy trousers. In a few minutes she gave me a skein of worsted to hold,\r\nand desired me to kneel in front of her, so as to bring my hands down to\r\nthe level of the low chair on which she was seated.\r\n\r\nI knelt close to the footstool on which her foot rested; it was raised\r\nup, and a very slight movement brought it against my person, at first\r\nrather below where my throbbing prick was distending my trousers. As she\r\ncommenced to wind her ball, she gradually pushed her foot further\r\nforward, until the toe actually touched the knob of my cock, and\r\noccasionally moved it right and left, exciting me beyond measure.\r\n\r\nI flushed up to the very ears, and trembled so violently that I thought\r\nI should have dropped the skein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, what is the matter with you, that you blush and tremble\r\nso, are you unwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not answer, blushed more than ever. The skein at length was\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cget up, and come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose and stood by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got in your trousers that is moving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here her busy fingers commenced unbuttoning them. Released from\r\nconfinement, out started my prick\xe2\x80\x94stiff as iron, and as large as that of\r\na youth of eighteen. Indeed, I was better hung than one boy selected out\r\nof five hundred of that age. Mrs. B., who had pretended to be perfectly\r\nastonished, exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, what a pego! Why Charles, my darling, you are a man not\r\na boy. What a size to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d and she gently handled it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it often\r\nin this state?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since Miss Evelyn came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray, sir, what has Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s coming had to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, Charles, be candid with me; what is it you mean where you say\r\nMiss Evelyn has caused you to be in such a state, have you shown her\r\nthis, and has she handled it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear no; never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it her face, her bosom, or her legs that have captivated you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was her feet and ankles, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, with her beautiful legs, which she\r\nsometimes exhibited without knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do all ladies\xe2\x80\x99 legs and ankles produce this effect upon you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if they are neat and pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what make you so excited now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the sight of your beautiful legs just now, and the recollection\r\nof what I saw the other day, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered out, blushing more than\r\never.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, her soft hand grasped my distended\r\nprick, and had commenced slowly slipping the loose skin over the swollen\r\nhead, and allowing it to slip back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, Charles, after what you saw in the closet, you know what\r\nthis is meant to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI muttered out an indistinct reply that I did, and I hung down my\r\nblushing face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never put it into a lady, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not answer, but sheepishly held down my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see what I had in the same place, when you were in the closet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it afford you any pleasure to see it again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. B. rose, went to the window, drew down the blind, then gently\r\nturned the key in the door. Returning to the chair, and drawing well up\r\nher dress, petticoats and chemise, she exposed all her person up to the\r\nmiddle of her belly; and sat down stretching herself backwards, and\r\nopening her thighs well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear boy, look at it if you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was no longer shy. Nature prompted me to an act of gallantry that\r\ngratified the lady immensely. Falling on my knees, I glued my lips to\r\nthe delicious spot, pushing my tongue in as far as I could, and sucked\r\nit. It was quite spunky; I had no doubt but that Mr. B. had fucked her\r\ntwo or three times just before leaving. This, however, made no\r\ndifference to me. The attack was as unexpected as it was delightful to\r\nthe lady. She placed both hands on my head and pressed my face against\r\nher throbbing cunt. She was evidently hotly excited, not only by what I\r\nwas then doing, but by the scene, the conversation, and the handling of\r\nmy prick, which she had been indulging in. She wriggled her bottom\r\nnervously below me, I continued to greedily lick her moist and juicy\r\ncunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! dear Charles, what exquisite delight you are giving me. Oh!\r\noh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she pressed my face more fully into the gaping sheath, and thrusting\r\nher bottom up at the same time, spent right into my mouth, over my\r\ncheeks, chin, and neck. Her thighs closed convulsively round my head,\r\nand for some moments she remained still. I continued to lick away, and\r\nswallowed the delicious spunk that still flowed from her. At last she\r\nspoke again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you darling Charles, I love you for ever; but get up, it is now my\r\nturn to give you a taste of the exquisite pleasure you have given me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI raised myself, and she drew me to her, and gave me a long kiss,\r\nlicking her own sperm from off my lips and cheek; and desiring me to\r\nthrust my tongue into her mouth, she sucked it deliciously, while her\r\nsoft hand and gentle fingers had again sought, found, and caressed my\r\nstiff-standing prick. She then desired me to lay myself on the floor,\r\nwith three pillows to raise my head, and lifting up all her petticoats,\r\nand striding across me, with her back to my face, she knelt down, then\r\nstooping forward, she took my standing prick in her mouth, and at the\r\nsame time lowering her buttocks, brought her beautiful cunt right over\r\nand down upon my mouth, the pillows exactly supporting my head at the\r\nproper level, to command a thorough enjoyment of the whole, which now I\r\nhad completely before my eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the former sucking my own position hid everything from view beyond\r\nthe rich mass of hair adorning her splendid mount of Venus, which I\r\nfound to be much more abundant than it had appeared to me when I had\r\nseen it from the closet. When I applied my lips to the delicious gap, I\r\nfound that she had the most beautiful silky light curls running up to\r\nand around her charming pink bottom-hole, and losing themselves in the\r\nchink between the buttocks. I applied myself furiously to the delicious\r\ngash, and sucked and thrust my tongue in alternately. I could see by the\r\nnervous twitching of her buttocks, and the bearing down of her whole\r\nbottom on my face, how much she was enjoying it. I, too, was in an\r\nextasy of delight. One hand gently frigged the lower portion of my\r\nprick, while the other played with my balls, and her beautiful mouth,\r\nlips, and tongue sucked, pressed, and tickled the head of my excited\r\nprick. The more furiously I sucked her cunt, the more her lips\r\ncompressed the head of my pego, and her tongue sought to enter the\r\nurethra, giving me almost overpowering delight. Such reciprocal efforts\r\nsoon brought on the extatic crisis, I cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lady! oh, dear lady! let me go; I am dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew well enough what was coming, but she had her own way, and at\r\nthe instant that she again poured down upon my mouth and face a\r\nplenteous discharge, her own rosy mouth received a torrent of my sperm.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes we lay mutually breathless and exhausted. Then Mrs. B.\r\nrose, shook down her clothes, assisted me to rise, and taking me in her\r\narms, and pressing me lovingly to her bosom, told me I was a dear\r\ncharming fellow, and had enraptured her beyond measure. She then\r\nembraced me fondly, kissing my mouth and eyes, and desiring me to give\r\nher my tongue, sucked it so sweetly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, fasten up your trousers, my darling boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I had done so, the blind was drawn up, and the door unlocked.\r\n\r\nWe sat down, I by her side with one arm round her lovely neck, and the\r\nother clasped in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I can depend upon your prudence, my dear Charles, to keep all\r\nthis a profound secret from everyone. Your mamma thinks you a child, and\r\nwill suspect nothing. I shall take an opportunity of suggesting that you\r\nshall sleep in the small room adjoining my bedroom, and with which there\r\nis a door of communication. When everyone is gone to bed, I shall open\r\nthe door, and you shall come and sleep with me, and I will let you enjoy\r\nme as you saw Mr. B. do the other day. Will you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! above all things, oh, yes. But you must also allow me to kiss that\r\ndelicious spot again that has just given me such pleasure. Will you not,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my darling boy, whenever we can do so safely, and unobserved;\r\nbut I must impress upon you never to seem very familiar with me before\r\nanyone, or to take the slightest liberty unless I invite you to do so.\r\nAnything of the sort would certainly draw attention, and lead to our\r\ndetection, and at once put an end to what I mean shall be a delightful\r\nconnection for you as well as myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI, of course, promised the most perfect obedience to her very prudent\r\ndirections. The ice was broken, and we allowed no ceremony to stand\r\nbetween us. I grew again very excited, and would fain have proceeded at\r\nonce to try again to fuck her as well as suck her, but she was\r\ninexorable, and told me I should only spoil the pleasure we should\r\nafterwards have in bed. The day passed like an hour in her charming\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe carriage brought mamma and party to dinner. Mamma hoped I had\r\nbehaved well, and been attentive to Mrs. B. in her absence. She answered\r\nnothing could be better, and that I was quite a model youth\xe2\x80\x94so gentle\r\nand so obedient.\r\n\r\nMy mother found that she had caught cold, and had febrile symptoms after\r\ndinner. Mrs. B. persuaded her to retire to bed, and accompanied her.\r\nWhen in her room, she apparently noticed, for the first time, my little\r\nbed. She took the opportunity of suggesting that it would be much better\r\nto remove it to the small room, so as to leave my mother in perfect\r\nquiet, which my coming to bed might disturb.\r\n\r\nThis was said in such an innocent natural manner, that no suspicion was\r\nexcited on the part of mamma or anybody else. Mamma only making the\r\nobjection that my early rising might by my noise disturb Mrs. B. in the\r\nnext room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; I am not so easily disturbed, besides he has been so well\r\nbehaved all day, that I am sure, if I tell him to be quiet in the\r\nmorning, he will not fail to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it was settled, and my bed was at once removed to the little room.\r\n\r\nI know not what Miss Evelyn thought of this; at any rate, she made no\r\nremark, and I went to bed early. It will easily be conceived that I did\r\nnot go to sleep. The hours struck one after the other, and no appearance\r\nof my amiable instructress. The remembrance of all her charms was ever\r\npresent to my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and I longed once more to dart my tongue into\r\nher moist and juicy cunt, as well as to try the new method that was to\r\ninitiate me into the real secrets of Venus.\r\n\r\nThe long delay of her coming put me in a perfect fever. I tossed and\r\ntumbled in bed; my prick throbbed almost to bursting. Fortunately, I had\r\nnever frigged myself, and that resource never occured to me, or I might\r\nhave rendered myself quite incapable of enjoying the raptures my\r\nbeautiful benefactress afterwards entranced me with. At last I heard\r\nvoices and footsteps on the stairs. Mrs. B. bid Miss Evelyn good night,\r\nand the next minute her door was opened, closed again, and the key\r\nturned in the lock. I had taken the precaution to do so with my door. I\r\nheard her use the night vase, and then she opened my door, at once\r\ncoming to my bedside. Seeing me awake and quite flushed, she kissed me,\r\nand whispered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not been to sleep, Charles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, in the same subdued tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was going to sleep with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lips pressed mine, and her soft hand, thrust under the clothes;\r\nsought for and caressed my stiff-standing prick\xe2\x80\x94it was as hard as iron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor boy, I am afraid you have been suffering. How long has it been in\r\nthis state?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the evening, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and I did think you were such a long time in\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Charles, I could not come sooner without causing suspicion\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthought Miss Evelyn was suspicious, so I pretended to have no desire to\r\ngo to bed; and even when she showed evident symptoms of drowsiness after\r\nher long ride, I rallied her upon it, and begged her to sit up with me\r\nyet a little; until at last she could hold out no longer, and begged me\r\nto let her retire. I grumblingly complied, and she is thrown completely\r\noff any scent on our account, as she could never suppose I was impatient\r\nas you to come here. I shall undress as fast as possible, and then do my\r\nbest to relieve you of this painful stiffness. Get up, shut this door,\r\nand come to my bed. My room has an inner baize door, and we shall there\r\nbe certain of not being overheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI instantly complied, and she commenced undressing. Every detail of her\r\ncharming toilet was devoured by my greedy eyes. Her smooth, glossy, and\r\nabundant hair, arranged in braids, was neatly fastened in under a\r\ncoquettish lace cap with pretty blue ribbons. Her _chemise de nuit_ of\r\nthe finest, almost transparent cambric was edged with fine openwork. She\r\nlooked devine. The drawers of the commode contained scent bags of that\r\npeculiar odour which is generally found to perfume the persons of the\r\nmost seductive women. In another moment she was in bed, clasping me in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Charles, you must be a good boy, and make no noise, and allow me\r\nto teach you your first love lesson, see I will lay myself down on my\r\nback, thus\xe2\x80\x94do you place yourself on your knees between my out-spread\r\nthighs\xe2\x80\x94there, that is a darling\xe2\x80\x94now let me lay hold of your dear\r\ninstrument. Now lay yourself down on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI placed myself on her beautiful smooth and white belly and pressed\r\nagainst the hair of her mount. With her long taper fingers she guided my\r\nprick\xe2\x80\x94I trembled in every limb and almost felt sick with excitement\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwhen I felt the delicious sensation caused by the insertion of my\r\nskinned pintle between the smooth warm oily folds of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s cunt\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ngave but one shove which carried me up so that I swooned away on her\r\nbelly and milk-white bosom.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself I still lay on her belly, enfolded in her lovely\r\narms, my prick sheathed up to the cods in her delicious cunt, which was\r\nthrobbing in the most extatic way and pressing and closing with every\r\nfold on my prick\xe2\x80\x94which had hardly lost any of its pristine stiffness; as\r\nmy eyes began to discern her features, an exquisite smile played upon my\r\ndarling companion\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sad rogue,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have given me a baby; what have you\r\nbeen doing to make you spend so soon, and in such a quantity. Did you\r\nlike it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dearest madam, I have been in heaven\xe2\x80\x94surely no joy can be greater\r\nthan you have given me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not know as yet everything that is to be done, and to how\r\nmuch greater an extent the pleasure may be enhanced by mutual efforts;\r\nmove your instrument gently in and out\xe2\x80\x94there, that is delicious, but not\r\nso fast. Good, is it not nice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she moved in unison with me, meeting each slow thrust down by an\r\nequal movement upwards, and squeezing my prick in the most delicious\r\nmanner internally, as she retired again to meet succeeding thrusts in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nOh! it was extatic\xe2\x80\x94my prick, swollen to its utmost size, seemed to fill\r\nher exquisite vagina, which although capable of easily accommodating the\r\nlarger prick of Mr. B., appeared to be sufficiently contracted to\r\nembrace tightly with its smooth and slippery folds my stiff throbbing\r\nprick. So we continued, I shoving myself into her, and she upheaving her\r\nbeautiful bottom to meet me. My hands removed everywhere, and my mouth\r\nsucked her lips and tongue, or wandered over her pulpy breasts sucking\r\ntheir tiny nipples. It was a long bout indeed, prolonged by Mrs.\r\nBenson\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, and she enjoyed it thoroughly, encouraged me by\r\nevery endearing epithet, and by the most voluptuous manoeuvres. I was\r\nquite beside myself. The consciousness that I was thrusting my most\r\nprivate part into that part of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s person which is regarded with\r\nsuch sacred delicacy caused me to experience the most enraptured\r\npleasure. Maddened by the intensity of my feeling I at length quickened\r\nmy pace. My charming companion did the same, and we together yielded\r\ndown a most copious and delicious discharge.\r\n\r\nAlthough I retained sufficient rigidity to keep him in his place, Mrs.\r\nB. would not allow any further connection with her, and she made me\r\nwithdraw, and bade me go to sleep like a good boy, and she would give me\r\na further lesson in the morning.\r\n\r\nFinding that she was determined on this point, and that she disposed\r\nherself to slumber, I felt I was obliged to follow her example, and at\r\nlast fell fast asleep. It might be about five in the morning, quite\r\nlight at that time of year, when I awoke, and instead of finding myself,\r\nas usual, in my own little bed\xe2\x80\x94I found my arms round the person of a\r\ncharming woman, whose large plump smooth bottom lay in my lap, pressing\r\nagainst my belly and thigh. I found my prick already in a rampant state,\r\nand it at once began throbbing and forcing its way between the delicious\r\ncheeks of her immense bottom, seeking the delightful sheath it had so\r\nenjoyed the previous part of the night. Whether Mrs. B, was asleep or\r\nnot, I do not know, but am inclined to think she really was so, from the\r\nmuttered mistake she made in waking. She was probably dreaming, for she\r\nmechanically raised her thighs. I pressed my prick stoutly forward\r\nagainst her luxurious body, knowing that the entrance to the temple of\r\npleasure which had so entranced me the night before lay in that\r\ndirection. I found more difficulties than I expected, but at length\r\nbegan to penetrate, although the orifice appeared much tighter than on\r\nthe previous evening. Excited by the difficulties of entrance, I clasped\r\nthe lady firmly round the waist and pushed forcibly and steadily\r\nforward. I felt the folds give way to the iron stiffness of my prick,\r\nand one-half of it was fairly embedded in my extremely tight sheath. I\r\nput down my hand to press my prick a little downwards to facilitate the\r\nfurther entrance; you may imagine my astonishment when on so doing I\r\nfound myself in the lady\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole, instead of her cunt. This at\r\nonce explained the difficulty of entrance. I was about to withdraw and\r\nplace it in the proper orifice when a convulsive pressure of the\r\nsphincter caused me such exquisite satisfaction by the pressure of the\r\nfolds on the more sensitive upper half of my prick, which was so\r\ndelicious, and so much tighter, and more exciting than my previous\r\nexperience of the cunt that I could not resist the temptation of\r\ncarrying the experiment to the end. Therefore, thrusting my two fingers\r\ninto her cunt, I pressed my belly forwards with all my might, and\r\nsheathed my prick in her bottom-hole to its full extent. Mrs. B at this\r\nawoke, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! Fred, you hurt me cruelly. I wish\r\nyou would be content with my cunt, I shall be unable to walk tomorrow.\r\nYou know it always has that effect. It is downright cruel of you\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nsince you are in, stay quiet a little, and then continue to frig me with\r\nyour fingers, as you know that eventually gives me great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe calls me Fred, what can she mean? I was, however, too agreeably\r\nsituated to speculate on anything, but as I was now buried within her\r\nbottom-hole, I lay quiet for a few minutes as she had requested; and as\r\nher complaints subsided, and I felt a slight reciprocating movement, I,\r\ntoo, moved within her, working at the same time my two fingers in her\r\ncunt. By this time she was wide awake, and became conscious of who was\r\nher bedfellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about, Charles?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know where you\r\nare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know I was doing anything wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoing wrong, indeed! My, a lady\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole was never intended for a\r\npego. How came you to put it in there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell; I did not do it on purpose. I thought I was going into\r\nthe same delightful place I was in last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this time I was moving my prick in and out of one aperture, and my\r\nfingers were working away in the other. The tightness of the sheath\r\nround my prick was delicious beyond anything I could conceive, and I\r\nthink, from the way the lady conducted herself, she liked it as much as\r\nI did. At any rate, she permitted me to go on until I had a delicious\r\ndischarge; and she herself spent all over my hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the bout was over, she jumped out of bed, went to the basin, and\r\nwith a sponge purified herself. After which, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, you had better come and wash yourself, too; and take care\r\nnot to make a mistake of this kind again, as it is sometimes attended\r\nwith disagreeable consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now perfect sunny daylight, and my enchanting mistress looked so\r\nlovely in her almost transparent cambric nightshirt that I was\r\nemboldened to ask her to let me see her perfectly naked in all her\r\nglorious beauty of form. She gratified me at once; but laughingly,\r\npulled off my nightshirt, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, must have the pleasure not only of contemplating your promising\r\nyouthful charms, but of embracing your dear form disencumbered of all\r\nthe superfluities of dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe clasped each other in a most enrapturing embrace, and then my lovely\r\nand engaging companion allowed me to turn her in every direction so as\r\nto see, admire, and devour every charm of her exquisitely formed body.\r\nOh! she was indeed beautiful\xe2\x80\x94shoulders broad, bosom, or rather upper\r\nneck, flat, not showing any projection of the collar bone; bubbies firm,\r\nwell separated and round, with most exquisite rosy nipples not much\r\ndeveloped; a perfect waist, small naturally, with charming swelling\r\nhips, and an immense bottom\xe2\x80\x94it was almost out of proportion, large, but\r\noh, how beautiful. Then her belly, undulating so enticingly, and\r\nswelling out, the lowest part into a very fine and prominent mons\r\nVeneris, covered with a thick crop of silky and curly light hair; then\r\nthe entrance to the grotto of Venus had such delicious pouting lips,\r\nrosy, but with hair still thick on each side, which is often not the\r\ncase even with women who have a sufficient tuft above, how beautiful\r\nwhere it exists as it did in this charming and perfect woman, continuing\r\nin beautiful little curls not only down to but around her lovely pinky\r\nand puckered little bottom-hole, the delights of which I had already, in\r\nthis infancy of my love education, tasted and enjoyed. Her two alabaster\r\nthighs, worthily supporting by their large well-rounded fleshy forms,\r\nthe exquisite perfections of the upper body, I have already described.\r\nHow beautiful, elegant, and elongated her legs were, rising from\r\nwell-turned ankles and most tiny beautiful feet. Her skin was white as\r\nmilk, and dazzlingly fair and smooth. To my young eyes she was a perfect\r\ngoddess of beauty. Even now, in advanced life, I can remember nothing\r\nthat, as a whole surpassed her, although I have met many with points\r\nunsurpassingly beautiful\xe2\x80\x94some carry it in the bosom, some in the general\r\ncarriage, some in the mount of Venus and bottom together, and some in\r\nlegs and thighs; but this devine creature, without having the appearance\r\nof it when dressed, was, when stripped, perfect in all her parts as well\r\nas beautiful in face\xe2\x80\x94caressing and voluptuous by nature, and lending\r\nherself, with the most enchanting graces to instruct me in all the\r\nmysteries of love, and let me say, of _lust_ also.\r\n\r\nWe caressed each other with such mutual satisfaction that nature soon\r\ndrove us to a closer and more active union of the bodies. Fondly\r\nembracing one another, we approached the bed, and being equally excited\r\nthrew ourselves upon it, and, in the exquisite contact of our naked\r\nflesh, enjoyed a long, long bout of love, in which my most charming\r\ncompanion exhibited all the resources of amorous enjoyment. Never shall\r\nI forget the luxury of that embrace. She checked my natural tendency to\r\nrush at once to a completion. I think we must have enjoyed the raptures\r\nof that embrace fully half an hour before bringing on the grand finale,\r\nin which my active companion showed the extraordinary suppleness of her\r\ndelicious body by throwing her legs over my back, pushing my bottom\r\nforward with her heels, and raising and sinking her bottom in unison\r\nwith each thrust of my terribly stiff prick, which seemed to swell and\r\nbecome thicker and harder than ever. In retiring from each thrust, her\r\ncunt seemed to close upon my prick with the force of a pair of pincers.\r\nWe both came to the extatic moment at the same time, and both actually\r\nscreamed with delight; my ardent mistress in her fury of excitement\r\nactually bit my shoulder and drew blood; but I felt it not\xe2\x80\x94I was in the\r\nseventh heaven of delight, and lay for long almost insensible on her\r\nbeauteous body, clasped in her loving arms. On coming to our senses:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my beloved boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cnever, never, have I experienced such\r\npleasure. You are a perfect angel. I only fear I shall come to love you\r\ntoo much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned on our sides without dislodging the dear instrument of our\r\nenjoyment, and my lovely friend prattled on and delighted me with her\r\ntoying, embracing, and gaiety. My prick had once more swelled up, and I\r\nwished to quietly enjoy a fuck in the luxurious position in which we\r\nlay; but my lovely friend said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must not be, my dear Charles, I must consider your health. You\r\nhave already done more than your age warrants, and you must rise and go\r\nto your bed to recover, by a sound sleep, your strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut feel how strong I am,\xe2\x80\x9d and I gave a forcible thrust into her\r\nglowing and well-moistened sheath. But, though she certainly was greatly\r\nexcited, she suddenly turned round and unseated me, and drew away from\r\nme, refusing to take it again. As she was quite naked, the movements of\r\nher beauteous form were most graceful and enchanting, and one leg being\r\nthrown backwards left her lovely cunt full in view, and actually gaping\r\nopen before me. Seized with the strongest desire to suck and kiss it, as\r\nI had done the night before, I begged that at least she would grant me\r\nthat last favour, as it could not in any way do me harm. To this she\r\nreadily consented, and lay down on her back, opening her glorious\r\nthighs, and with a pillow under her bottom so as to raise up her cunt\r\ninto a better position for me to gamahuche her, as she called it. Before\r\nletting me begin, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Charles, do you see that little projection at the upper part of\r\nmy quim, that is my clitoris, and is the site of the most exquisite\r\nsensation; you see it is rather hard, even now, but you will find as you\r\ntitillate it with your tongue or suck it, that it will become harder and\r\nmore projecting, so apply your lips there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as my lovely mistress desired, and soon found it stiffen and stand\r\nup nearly an inch into my mouth.\r\n\r\nThe convulsive twitches of her buttocks, the pressure forward of her\r\nhand on my head, all proved the exquisite felicity my lovely friend was\r\nenjoying. I slipped my hand under my chin\xe2\x80\x94the position was awkward, but\r\nI managed to thrust my thumb into her cunt. My forefinger was somewhat\r\nin the way\xe2\x80\x94but finding it exactly opposite the rosy hole of her bottom,\r\nand all being very moist there, I pushed it forward and it easily\r\nentered. I could not move my hand very actively, but I continued to\r\ngently draw my finger and thumb a little back together, and then thrust\r\nforward again. It seemed to add immensely to the pleasure I was giving\r\nher; her whole body quivered with excessive excitement. My head was\r\npressed so firmly against her cunt that I had difficulty in breathing,\r\nbut I managed to keep up the action of tongue and fingers until I\r\nbrought on the exquisite crisis\xe2\x80\x94her buttocks rose, her hand pressed hard\r\non my head and her two powerful and fleshy thighs closed on my cheeks on\r\neach side and fixed me as if in a vice, while she poured down into my\r\nmouth and all over my chin, neck, and hand a perfect rush of sperm, and\r\nthen lay in convulsive movements of enjoyment, hardly knowing what she\r\nwas doing. As she held me so fast in every way, I continued to lick up\r\nthe delicious discharge, and continued at the same time to pass my\r\ntongue over her clitoris. This, by producing a new excitement, brought\r\nher senses round. So relaxing her hold of me with her thighs she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling Charles, come up to my arms that I may kiss you for the\r\nexquisite delight you have given me.\xe2\x80\x9d I did so, but took care, in\r\ndrawing myself up, to engroove my stiff-standing prick in the\r\nwell-moistened open cunt that lay raised on a pillow so conveniently in\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you sad traitor,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sweet companion. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I cannot, I must\r\nnot allow it,\xe2\x80\x9d but I held her tight round the waist, and her position\r\nwas too favourable for me to be easily unhorsed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you must not, my dear boy. If you will not consider yourself,\r\nconsider me. I shall be quite exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d I shut her mouth with my\r\nkisses and tongue, and soon the active movements I was making within her\r\ncharming vagina exercised their usual influence on her lubricity, so as\r\nto make her as eager for the fray as myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, my dear Charles, and you shall have it in a new position, which\r\nwill give you as much more pleasure as it will me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to cheat me, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! my darling, I am now as much on fire as you are\xe2\x80\x94withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed, half in fear. My fair mistress turned herself round, and\r\ngetting on her hands and knees, presented to my ardent gaze her\r\nmagnificent bottom. I thought she meant me to once more put it into the\r\nrosy little orifice, and said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cnot there\xe2\x80\x9d; but putting her hand under her\r\nbelly, and projecting it backwards between her thighs, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it me and I will guide it into the proper place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore doing so I stooped forward and pushing my face between the\r\nglorious cheeks of her bottom, sought and found the lovely little\r\norifice, kissed it, and thrust my tongue in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t Charles, dear, you tickle me so,\xe2\x80\x9d then flinching, and\r\nsqueezing her buttocks together, I had nothing for it but to put my\r\nprick in her hand. She immediately guided it to and engulphed it in her\r\nburning cunt up to the very hair. I found I apparently got in fully an\r\ninch further this way\xe2\x80\x94the position also gave my beautiful instructress\r\nmore power of pressure on my prick\xe2\x80\x94then her glorious buttocks, heaving\r\nunder my movements, and exposed in all their immensity, was most\r\nexciting and beautiful. I seized her below the waist with a hand upon\r\neach hip, pressing her magnificent backside against me each time that I\r\nthrust forward. Oh! it was indeed glorious to see. I was beside myself,\r\nand furious with the excitement the view of all these charms produced\r\nupon me. My charming mistress seemed equally to enjoy it, as was evinced\r\nby the splendid movements of her body; till at last overcome by the\r\ngrand finale, she sank forward on her belly, and I followed on her back,\r\nwithout losing the position of my throbbing prick within her. We both\r\nlay for some time incapable of movement, but the internal squeezing and\r\nconvulsive pressure of her cunt on my softened, but still enlarged\r\nprick, were exquisite beyond imagining. At last she begged me to relieve\r\nher. Getting out of bed, she sighed deeply, kissed me tenderly, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Charles, we must not be so extravagant in future, it will\r\ndestroy us both\xe2\x80\x94come, let me see you to your bed.\xe2\x80\x9d The sight of my\r\nlovely mistress standing naked in all the glory of her beauty and\r\nperfection of form began to have its usual effect upon my prick, which\r\nshowed symptoms of raising his head again; she gave it a pat, stooped\r\ndown, and for a moment plunged its head into her beautiful mouth, then\r\nseizing my nightshirt, she threw it over my head and conducted me to my\r\nown bed, put me in, tucked me up, and tenderly kissing me, left the\r\nroom, first unlocking my door and then locking the door of communication\r\nbetween the two rooms. Thus passed the first glorious night of my\r\ninitiation into all the rites of Venus, and at the hands of a lovely,\r\nfresh and beautiful woman, who had only been married long enough to make\r\nher a perfect adept in the art. Never, oh never! have I passed such a\r\nnight. Many and many a fine woman, perfect too in the art of fucking,\r\nhave I enjoyed, but the novelty and the charm, the variety and the\r\nsuperiority of the teacher, all combined to make this night the _ne plus\r\nultra_ of erotic pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt need not be said that, exhausted by the numerous encounters I had in\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s battlefield, I fell into a deep and sound sleep, until aroused by\r\nbeing rudely shaked up. I opened my eyes in astonishment. It was my\r\nsister Mary. She threw her arms round my neck, and kissing me, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lazy boy, do you know they are _all_ down at breakfast, and you\r\nstill asleep. What has come over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI got frightened with a horrible dream, and lay awake so\r\nlong afterwards that when I did sleep, I overslept myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, get up at once,\xe2\x80\x9d and pulling the clothes quite off me, she laid\r\nbare my whole private parts, with my cock, as usual in youth on waking,\r\nat full stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, fixing her eyes upon it in astonishment at its\r\nthickness and length. \xe2\x80\x9cHow your doodle has grown,\xe2\x80\x9d and she laid hold of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it is as hard as wood, and see how red its head is.\xe2\x80\x9d Without\r\nher knowing why, it evidently had its natural effect on her sense, and\r\nshe flushed as she squeezed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear Mary, I have learnt a great secret about that thing, which\r\nI will tell you the first time we can be quite alone and secure from\r\ninterruption. Just now there is no time, but before you go downstairs,\r\nlet me see how your poor little Fanny is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had been used to these infantile expressions when in our ignorance\r\nand innocence we had mutual examinations of the difference of our sexes,\r\nand my sister was still as ignorant and innocent as ever. So when I said\r\nthat I had not seen it since it was so ill-treated in the terrible\r\nwhipping she had received from Miss Evelyn, she at once pulled up all\r\nher petticoats for me to look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie back for a moment on the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe complied. I was delighted. The prominence her mons Veneris had\r\nassumed, the increased growth of moss-like little curls, and the pouting\r\nlips of her tiny slit\xe2\x80\x94all was most promising and charming. I stooped and\r\nkissed it, licking her little prominent clitoris with my tongue; it\r\ninstantly hardened, and she gave a convulsive twitch of her loins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie, how nice it is! What is it you are doing? Oh, how nice!\r\nOh, pray go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I stopped, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at present, my darling sister, but when we can get away together I\r\nwill do that and something much better, all connected with the great\r\nsecret I have got to tell you. So run downstairs, and tell them why I\r\nhad overslept myself, but not a word to anyone about what I have told\r\nyou. I will be down in a trice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went away, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charlie, dear, what you did just now was so nice, and has made me\r\nfeel so queer; do find an early opportunity of telling me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery few minutes sufficed to finish my toilet and bring me to the\r\nbreakfast table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d broke out my mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this horrid dream?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly tell you, my dear mother, it was so confused; but I was\r\nthreatened to be murdered by horrid-looking men, and at last taken to\r\nhigh rocks and thrown down. The agony and fright awoke me, screaming,\r\nand all over perspiration. I could not sleep for hours after, even\r\nthough I hid my head under the clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Benson, who was quietly eating her breakfast.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fright you must have had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and at the same time, as I awoke with a scream, I was\r\nafraid I might have disturbed you, for all at once I remembered I was no\r\nlonger in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s room, but next door to you. I hope I did not wake\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, my dear boy; I never heard you, or I should have got up to see\r\nwhat was the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it passed off, and no further observation was made about it, but I\r\nonce caught Mrs. Benson\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and the expression and a slight nod was a\r\nsign of approval of my story. After breakfast we went as usual to the\r\nschoolroom. I thought Miss Evelyn was kinder in her manner to me than\r\nusual. She made me stand close to her when saying my lessons,\r\noccasionally letting her left arm fall round my neck, while she pointed\r\nto my book with the finger of the right, and there was always a certain\r\npressure before raising her arm again. These little caresses were\r\nfrequently repeated, as if she were wishing either to accustom me or\r\nherself to a habit of it, so as, doubtless, gradually to increase them\r\nto something more definite. I could not help feeling what a different\r\neffect these endearments would have had twenty-four hours earlier; but\r\nnow, momentarily satisfied passions, and the new love that had seized me\r\nfor Mrs. B., prevented at first the inevitable cockstand that would\r\notherwise have been produced by these approaches of Miss Evelyn. Not\r\nthat I had given up all desire to possess her. On the contrary, my last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s instruction only made me more anxious to have Miss Evelyn too.\r\nTherefore, I by no means repulsed her present caresses, but looked up\r\ninnocently in her face, and smiled affectionately. In the afternoon she\r\nwas more expansive, and drew me to her by her arm round my waist, and\r\npressed me gently to her person, saying how well I was attending to my\r\nlessons, and how sorry she was to have been obliged to punish me so\r\nseverely the week before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be a good boy in future, will you not, dear Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; as long as you are so kind to me. I love you so much, and you\r\nare so beautiful when you speak so kindly to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you little flatterer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she drew me to her lips and gave me a sweet kiss, which I returned\r\nwith eagerness. I felt my prick had raised itself up to its full extent\r\nas these caresses were exchanged, and as Miss Evelyn held me tight\r\npressed against her thigh, she must have felt it throbbing against her.\r\nThat she did so, I have no doubt, as her face flushed, and she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, that will do, go to your seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed; she rose in an agitated manner, left the room, and was absent\r\nfor a quarter of an hour. I had no doubt but that she was overcome by\r\nher feelings, and I thought to myself she will manage to have me some of\r\nthese days. I could afford to leave it to her own discretion, as my\r\ncharming mistress of last night was there to keep me in exercise and\r\ncool the effervescence of passion under which I should otherwise have\r\nlaboured. Nothing particular occured during the day; Mrs. B. was\r\napparently indifferent about me, and never sought to approach or be in\r\nany way familiar; I studied her looks and followed her example. Mamma\r\nsent me early to bed, as she feared I had not had sleep enough the\r\nprevious night by reason of my bad dream, and hoped I should have no\r\nmore of the kind. This time my beautiful mistress found me sound asleep\r\nwhen she came to bed. She did not awake me until she had completed her\r\nnight toilet, and was all ready to receive me in her arms. I sprung up,\r\nand in an instant, without a word being said, had her on her back, and\r\nwas into her delicious cunt as far as I could drive my stiff-standing\r\nprick. My energy and fury seemed to please and stimulate the lady, for\r\nshe replied to every eager thrust with as eager a spring forward. In\r\nsuch haste matters were very speedily brought to a crisis\xe2\x80\x94with mutual\r\nsighs, and \xe2\x80\x9coh\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cah\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d we sank exhausted, and lay for a very\r\nshort time, when charming Mrs. B. said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Charles, you are quite wild to me; what a hurry you have been in,\r\nbut it was very nice, and I forgive you, but you must be more rational\r\nin future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my beloved mistress, how can I help it; you are so beautiful, and\r\nso good to me; I quite adore and love every part of your charming body.\r\nI know I was too impetuous, but I must make it up by kissing and\r\nfondling the dear source of all my joys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not resist, but let me do as I liked. Pushing myself down the\r\nbed, I applied my lips and tongue to her lovely cunt, all wet with our\r\nmutual discharge, which was so sweet to the taste that I first began\r\nlicking between the lips, and then applied myself to her excited\r\nclitoris, and with my finger and thumb working as on the previous\r\nmorning I threw her into an extasy of delight, until again she had a\r\ndelicious discharge. Then creeping up, I thrust my prick into her\r\nwell-moistened and velvety cunt\xe2\x80\x94as you may imagine it was rampant as\r\never after my mouth contact with the exquisite quim I had been sucking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Charles, darling, I will show you another position, where you can\r\nlie easily with your dear delightful prick up to the hilt in the sheath\r\nyou have so charmingly excited. Here, lie down by my right side\xe2\x80\x94on your\r\nside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay down on her back, and throwing her right leg over my hips, told\r\nme to bend my knees forward and open my legs, or rather lift up my right\r\nleg. She placed her left thigh between my thighs, then slightly twisting\r\nher bottom up towards me brought the lips of her cunt directly before my\r\nprick, which she seized with her delicate fingers, and guided safely\r\ninto Venus\xe2\x80\x99s grotto. I gave one or two shoves, and she a heave or two,\r\nto house him comfortably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will take it reasonably in this way; we can go\r\non, or stay occasionally; embrace, cuddle, or talk, just as we please.\r\nAre you quite comfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! deliciously so!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, as my hand wandered all over her\r\nbeautiful belly and bubbies, and then my mouth sucked the last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, darling, that will do for the moment; I want to have some talk\r\nwith you. First, let me thank you for your very discreet behaviour this\r\nday, it quite justifies the confidence I had in you. Your story of the\r\ndream was capital, and just suited the purpose. I hope, my dear Charlie,\r\nthat under my auspices you will become a model lover\xe2\x80\x94your aptitude has\r\nalready proved in several ways. First and best, with all the appearance\r\nof a boy, you are quite a man, and even superior to many. You have\r\nalready shown great discretion and ready wit, and there is no reason to\r\nfear that you will become a general favourite with our sex, who soon\r\nfind out who is discreet and who is otherwise\xe2\x80\x94discretion is the trump\r\ncard of success with us. Alas! few of your sex understand this. Let me\r\nimpress one lesson on you, my dear Charles. You and I cannot continue\r\nlong on our present footing. My husband will return and carry me away,\r\nand although circumstances will throw us at intervals into each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms\xe2\x80\x94for you may be sure you will be always welcome to me\xe2\x80\x94yet my very\r\nabsence will force you to seek other outlets to the passions I have\r\nawakened and taught their power. I have one piece of advice to give you\r\nas to your conduct to newer lovers\xe2\x80\x94for have them you must, my dear\r\nCharles, however much you may fancy yourself now attached to me; with\r\nthese, let them all for some time imagine that each possesses you for\r\nthe first time. First of all, it doubles their satisfaction, and so\r\nincreases your pleasure. Your early discretion causes me to think that\r\nyou will see all the advantages of this conduct. I may add that if they\r\nsuppose you have had previous instruction, they, if they are women, will\r\nnever rest until they have drawn from you the secret of your first\r\ninstructress. You might, of course, tell some tale of a \xe2\x80\x98cock and a\r\nbull,\xe2\x80\x99 but in searching for the truth and cross-questioning you when you\r\nare least aware of it, they will lead you into contradictions, and the\r\ntruth will at last be ferreted out. Now this would be unjust to me, who\r\nhave risked a good deal to give you the delightful instructions of last\r\nnight, and, as I hope, of many more. So you see, my dear Charles, in all\r\nearly cases you must enact the part of an ignoramus _seeking_ for\r\ninstruction, with vague ideas of how to set about it. I hope, while I am\r\nnear you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cno such occasion will arise, but I feel certain,\r\nwith your passions and your power, dear, darling fellow\xe2\x80\x94push\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94I!\xe2\x80\x94I!\xe2\x80\x94I feel for cer\xe2\x80\x94certain they will ar\xe2\x80\x94arise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus ended the very wise and excellent advice this charming woman was\r\ngiving me. Do not imagine that I did not pay great attention, and,\r\nindeed, her very reasonable maxims became the guide of my after-life,\r\nand I owe to them a success with women rarely otherwise obtained. Her\r\nsensible remark had been drawn out to such a length, that my prick had\r\nso far rebelled that he had throbbed inside of her delicious cunt so\r\nforcibly as to produce a happy movement of her body that interrupted and\r\ncut short her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, my darling, pass your middle finger down and rub it on my\r\nclitoris, and then suck the nipple of my bubby next you, and work away\r\nwith your glorious prick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as desired. She seconded me with an art quite peculiar to herself,\r\nand at last we both died away in that love\xe2\x80\x99s death which is so\r\noverpowering and so delicious. The glorious position we were in rendered\r\nit almost impossible to lose ground, spend as often as you please; but\r\nif my prick had been one that would have shrunk to nothing, the\r\nwonderful power of retaining it within her possessed by my delicious\r\nmistress would have prevented the possibility of exit.\r\n\r\nIn after-nights I have often fallen sound asleep with it entirely\r\nengulphed within her, and awoke hours afterwards to find her\r\nextraordinary power of retention had held him firm, notwithstanding his\r\nhaving shrunk up to a mere piece of doughy flesh. In this instance,\r\nafter recovering our senses, I still retained my place, and we\r\nrecommenced our conversation; my lovely instructress giving me many and\r\nmost useful hints for my after-life. I have often since dwelt on the\r\nwisdom of all she so charmingly taught me, and wondered how so young a\r\nwoman could have so thorough a knowledge of her sex and the world. I\r\nsuppose love is a great master and inspired her on this occasion. I may\r\nhere remark that for forty years afterwards this charming woman and I\r\nremained the fastest of friends after being the most ardent of lovers.\r\nShe was the depository of all my erotic extravagancies, and never showed\r\nany jealousy, but really enjoyed the recital of my wildest love combats\r\nwith others.\r\n\r\nAlas! death at last took her from me, and I lost the mainstay of my\r\nexistence. Forgive this digression, but I am writing long after these\r\nevents, and sorrows will have their vent. Woe is me!\r\n\r\nTo return to present joys. We continued talking and toying, until I was\r\nagain anxious to commence love\xe2\x80\x99s combat. My prudent mistress wished me\r\nto finish for the time, and to sleep and refresh ourselves for renewed\r\nefforts; but youth and strength nerved me for the fight, and being\r\nsecurely fixed, I held her as in a vice, with my thighs around only one\r\nof hers that could have allowed her to escape. Passing my finger down on\r\nher stiffened clitoris I so excited her that she had no wish but to\r\nbring matters to a crisis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will renew our pleasure in another\r\nattitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo withdrawing her leg off my loins, she turned on her side, so as to\r\npresent her glorious buttocks before me, and pressed them into my belly\r\nand against my thighs, which seemed to introduce my prick even further\r\nthan he was within before. Besides, in all these positions, where a\r\nwoman presents her splendid backside to you, it is always more exciting,\r\nand has a greater hold of you than any other way. We did most thoroughly\r\nenjoy this splendid fuck, and without withdrawing, both fell into the\r\nsweetest imaginable slumber. This was one of those occasions in which,\r\nhaving fallen asleep engulphed, I awoke some five hours later, to find\r\nmy prick still lightly held within the velvety folds of one of the most\r\ndelicious cunts ever created for the felicity of man, or, I may say,\r\nwoman either. You may easily imagine how soon my prick swelled to his\r\nwonted size on finding himself still in such charming quarters. I let\r\nhim lay quite still, barring the involuntary throbs he could not avoid\r\nmaking, and bending my body away from my lovely mistress, I admired her\r\nbreadth of shoulders, the beauty of her upper arm, the exquisite _chute_\r\nof her loins, the swell of her hips, and the glorious projection and\r\nrotundity of her immense buttocks. I slowly and gently pushed in and out\r\nof her juicy sheath, until, awakened by the exquisite sensations of my\r\nslow movements, all her lubricity was excited, and we ended one of our\r\nmost delicious encounters, finishing, as usual, with a death-like\r\nexhaustion. She declared I had done enough for one night, and jumping\r\nout of bed, compelled me to betake myself to my own room, where, I must\r\nconfess, I very shortly slept as sound as could be, without at the same\r\ntime oversleeping myself.\r\n\r\nThus passed several successive nights, until the full of the moon, when\r\none day Mrs. B. complained of headache and feeling unwell. I was very\r\nmuch alarmed, but she took occasion to tell me it was quite natural, and\r\nshe would explain to me how it was so at night. I was obliged to be\r\ncontent with this. At night, she came and sat on my bed, and told me all\r\nthe mysteries of the case. How women, not with child, had these\r\nbleedings monthly, which, so far from being hurtful, were a relief to\r\nthe system, and that they happened at the full or the new moon,\r\ngenerally at the former. Further, that all connection with men must\r\ncease at such a time. I was in despair, for my prick was stiff enough to\r\nburst. However, my kind and darling mistress, to relieve me from the\r\npain of distention, took my prick in her mouth, and performed a new\r\nmanoeuvre. Wetting her middle finger with her saliva, she thrust it up\r\nmy bottom-hole, and worked in unison with the suction of the knob, and\r\nthe frigging of the root of my prick with the other hand. I had a most\r\nexquisite and copious discharge, the pleasure being greatly enhanced by\r\nthe action of the finger up my fundament. My charming mistress swallowed\r\nall I could give her, and did not cease sucking until the last drop had\r\nexuded from my throbbing prick.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to be satisfied with this, and my mistress informed me I\r\ncould have no more enjoyment for four or five days; which, to my\r\nimpatience, was like condemning me to as many ages of hope deferred. I\r\nobserved, while she was kissing me, that her breath had a peculiar\r\nodour, and I asked her what she had been eating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask, my dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the difference of your breath, generally so sweet and\r\nfragrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled and said it was all from the same cause she had just been\r\nexplaining to me, and was very generally so with women at that period. I\r\nmention this because it was the means of my discovering that Miss Evelyn\r\nwas exactly in the same state. She had continued her endearing caresses\r\nwithout proceeding much further than I have already described, except\r\nmore frequently kissing me. She now always did so on first entering the\r\nschoolroom, and also when we were dismissed. I suppose to prevent an\r\nobservation or inference, she had adopted the same habit with my\r\nsisters. On this day, having drawn me with her arm round my waist close\r\nto her, when she kissed me I felt the very same odour of breath that I\r\nhad observed in Mrs. Benson. She too was languid that day and complained\r\nof headache. I also observed a dark line under her eyes, and on\r\nafterwards observing Mrs. B., saw precisely the same\xe2\x80\x94so I became\r\nconvinced they were unwell from the same cause. Mrs. B. had told me that\r\nmost women were so at the full of the moon\xe2\x80\x94which was then the case.\r\n\r\nThe next day my mother proposed to drive to town, and probably knowing\r\nthe state of the case, asked Mrs. B. and Miss Evelyn to accompany her,\r\nas she thought the airing would be beneficial. They at once accepted\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nyounger sister cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mamma, let me go with you also.\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\r\ninterposed, and thought she had the best right\xe2\x80\x94but Lizzie said she had\r\nspoken first. I managed to give Mary a wink and a shake of the head,\r\nwhich she instantly comprehended, so gracefully giving way, although\r\nwith apparent reluctance, it was arranged that Eliza should accompany\r\nthe ladies. I now felt my opportunity was at hand to initiate my darling\r\nsister into the delightful mysteries that I had just been myself\r\ninstructed in.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the carriage drove up, and we stood looking after them\r\nuntil they were lost to sight. Then returning into the parlour, Mary\r\nthrew her arms round my neck, and kissing me, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am glad, Charlie, you winked to me, for now you know we can do as\r\nwe like, and you can tell me all about this secret, and you must kiss my\r\nlittle Fanny as you did before, it was so nice. I have thought of\r\nnothing else, but how to have it done again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my darling, I shall do all that, and more, but we cannot do so\r\nhere. I tell you what we will do\xe2\x80\x94we will pretend to go for a long walk\r\nin the country, but instead of that, we will pass through the shrubbery\r\ninto the orchard and hazelwood, and so gain the little remote summer\r\nhouse, of which I have secured the key; there we shall be safe from all\r\nobservation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis little summer house was at some distance from the house, and in a\r\nlonely corner of the orchard, raised on an artificial mount, so that its\r\nwindows should command a lovely view beyond the walls of the grounds. It\r\nwas about ten feet square\xe2\x80\x94was beautifully sheltered, and the ladies in\r\nsummer took their work there, and occupied it for hours every fine day;\r\nso it was furnished with tables and chairs, and on one side a long couch\r\nwithout a back. It had already entered into my idea that this was the\r\nspot I should contrive to get to with Mary\xe2\x80\x94little thinking how chance\r\nwould throw so glorious an opportunity in my way so soon. It was always\r\nkept locked to prevent it being used by the servants, gardeners, or\r\nothers. I knew where the key was kept, and secured it when the ladies\r\nwere dressing for their drive\xe2\x80\x94so after staying sufficiently long to\r\nprevent any suspicion, and saying then we were going for a long walk in\r\nthe country, so as to prevent them seeking for us at the summer house if\r\nany visitors should chance to call, we sallied out, but re-entered the\r\ngrounds where we could not be observed, and speedily gained the spot we\r\nhad in view\xe2\x80\x94entered and locked the door. Then I drew down the blinds,\r\nthrew off my coat and waistcoat, and told Mary to take off her shawl and\r\nbonnet, and outer gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why all this, Charlie, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, my darling\xe2\x80\x94all those are in the way of kissing and toying with\r\nyour charming little Fanny, and next, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything to appear\r\ntumbled when we go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was enough, and she did everything as I desired, indeed, more, for\r\nshe took off her petticoat and little corset, saying she would be cooler\r\nthus. So, following her example, I took off my trousers, saying she\r\nwould be better able to see and play with my doodle. When these\r\npreliminaries were accomplished, I drew her on my knees\xe2\x80\x94first pulling up\r\nher shift and my own shirt, so that our naked flesh should be in\r\ncontact. Seeing that her chemise fell off from her bosom, I first felt\r\nher little bubbies, which were beginning to develop themselves, and had\r\nthe tiniest little pink nipples that even my lips could hardly get hold\r\nof. She had pulled up my shirt to look again at the great change that\r\nhad occured to my prick\xe2\x80\x94of course, our preliminaries had already excited\r\nit to a stiff-standing position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charlie, what a size it is to be sure; and how nice to pull this\r\nskin over its head; look how it runs back again. Oh! how funny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was time to stop this, or she would have soon made me discharge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what is this great secret, and what has it to do with your\r\ndoodle and my Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you, but you must never say a word to a soul\xe2\x80\x94not even to\r\nEliza, she is too young yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was one day seeking something in the closet in Mrs. Benson\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nwhen I heard them coming, and had only the time to slip into the closet.\r\nThey entered, locked the door, and Mr. B. laid her on the bed, and\r\nlifted up all her petticoats so that I saw her Fanny quite surrounded\r\nwith hairs, as yours will be by and by. Mr. B, stooped down, and applied\r\nhis tongue as I did to you the other morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; and it was so nice, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what Mrs. B. said when he had done. Then he pulled out\r\nhis doodle, such a size, much bigger than mine, and whipped it into her\r\nFanny. I was quite frightened, and thought he must have killed her. But\r\nno, it went in quite easy; and she hugged and kissed him while he pushed\r\nit up and down for some time, till they both stopped all at once. He\r\nthen drew it out, hanging down all wet, and asked if it had not given\r\nher great pleasure. \xe2\x80\x98Delightful,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I have now got used to it,\r\nbut you know you hurt me, and made me so sore the first time you did\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 After this they left the room, and I got away without being\r\ndiscovered. But I found out what our two things were made for, we will\r\ndo as they did, so lie down on the couch whilst I kneel at the end, and\r\nbegin in the way I kissed it the other morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charlie, if it is all like that, I shall be so pleased with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDown she squatted, drawing up her chemise. My hand wandered all over her\r\ncharming belly and mount. Then kneeling down, and putting her legs over\r\nmy shoulders, and my hands under her thighs and bottoms, I applied my\r\ntongue at once to her little clitoris, which I found was already stiff,\r\nand showing its head at the upper part of her pinky slit. The action of\r\nmy agile tongue produced an instantaneous effect\xe2\x80\x94her loins and thighs\r\nheaved up her bottom to press her little pouting cunt against my face.\r\nMechanically she put her hand on my head, and muttered terms of\r\nendearment\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, darling Charlie, how delicious! Oh! do go on! it is so nice, &amp;c.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wanted no stimulant, but licked away until, with shortened breath; and\r\ngreater heavings of her body, she began to stammer\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! I feel so queer\xe2\x80\x94ah, stop; I am going to faint\xe2\x80\x94I, I, I,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it any longer\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Her limbs relaxed, and she died\r\naway in her first discharge, which was very glutinous and nice, but only\r\nscanty in quantity. I let her quiet until she came to; then looking in\r\nher face, and smiling, I asked her how she liked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I was in heaven, dear Charlie, but I thought it was killing me\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas almost too much to bear\xe2\x80\x94nothing could be more delicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something more delicious still, but, I\r\nmust kiss you in this way again before we try the other; the more moist\r\nthe inside is the easier I shall get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Charlie, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you will ever get in your doodle,\r\nnow that it has grown so big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will try, and if it hurts you too much we can stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I began again to gamahuche her; this time it took a longer effort to\r\nproduce the ultimate result; but apparently with still greater effect,\r\nand a more copious discharge. Her little cunt being now relaxed, and\r\nwell moistened with her own discharge and my saliva, and well inclined\r\nto receive my prick, I spat upon it and lubricated it from head to root.\r\nThen rising from my knees, I stretched myself over Mary\xe2\x80\x99s belly, and\r\ngently directing my prick, and rubbing it up and down first between the\r\nlips, and exciting her clitoris by the same action, I gently and\r\ngradually inserted its head between the lips of her charming little\r\ncunt. There was less difficulty than might have been expected, the\r\ngamahuching and double spending had relaxed the muscles, and her\r\npassions being excited also acted on her organs of generation; at all\r\nevents, I got in the head, and about two inches of its length without\r\nher murmuring anything beyond\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow big it feels\xe2\x80\x94it seems to stretch me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was exciting me dreadfully, and it was only by the greatest\r\neffort that I did not thrust rudely forward. I now felt I was pushing\r\nagainst some obstacle, I thrust hard and hurt her. She cried out, begged\r\nme to stop. I was so near the finale that I felt I must go on. So,\r\nplunging forward, I rushed, at the impediment, and made her cry out most\r\nlustily. Probably another push would have decided my position, but\r\nnature could hold out no longer, and I yielded down my erotic tribute to\r\nher virginal charms, without having actually deflowered her. So far,\r\nperhaps, it was fortunate, because I poured into her a torrent of sperm\r\nwhich was not only balm to her partially wounded hymen, but so relaxed\r\nand lubricated the interior of her cunt as greatly to facilitate my\r\nafter-efforts.\r\n\r\nI lay quiet still for some time, and the gradual swelling out and\r\nthrobbing of my prick reawakened her young passions. She said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, my dear, you said that it would prove delicious in the end,\r\nand I can feel it is becoming so. I have no more pain, and you shall go\r\non just as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs my prick stiffened at her endearing words and involuntary pressures,\r\nand as I had it completely under control, since I had taken the edge off\r\nits immediate appetite by the last discharge, I held it literally well\r\nin hand; and as I had lost no ground by withdrawing, I started with the\r\nadvantage of possession. First I slipped my hand down between our two\r\nbellies and began frigging her clitoris, which immediately excited her\r\npassions to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie, dear, now push it all in\xe2\x80\x94I do so long for it\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare how it hurts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been giving short thrusts more to stimulate her passions than to\r\nalleviate my own; and as she was totally unaware of what was going to\r\nhappen, she widened her thighs and heaved up her bottom, expanding her\r\nvagina in the act. I gathered my strength together, and as my cock was\r\nstanding as stiff as iron, I suddenly drove it forward, and felt that I\r\nbroke through something, and gained two inches more insertion at least.\r\nThe effect on my poor sister was most painful, she shrieked out lustily;\r\nstrove hard to unsheath me, wriggled her body in all directions to\r\neffect this; but I was too securely engulphed for that, and all her\r\nstruggles only enabled me the more easily to sheathe him up to the very\r\nhairs. So excited was I by her tears and screams, that I was no sooner\r\nthere than a torrent of sperm burst from me, and I lay like a corpse on\r\nher body, but perfectly maintaining the ground I possessed. This\r\ndeath-like quiet lasted some minutes, and, to a certain extent, assuaged\r\nthe violence of the pain I put poor Mary to. Doubtless, also, the balmy\r\nnature of the ample quantity of sperm I had shot up to her womb helped\r\nto soothe her suffering. At all events, when we were both able again to\r\nconverse, she unbraided me with the agony I had caused her, and wished\r\nme to get off her at once; but retaining the advantageous possession of\r\nher very tight and delicious sheath, I told her all was now over, and we\r\nmight look forward to nothing but enrapturing pleasure.\r\n\r\nSome minutes had elapsed in these remonstrances on one side; and\r\ncoaxings on the other, when I suddenly felt her charming little cunt\r\nactually throb upon and give an involuntary squeeze to my prick, which\r\nwas still throbbing her. He was far too ready to stand at any time,\r\nstill more when engulphed in the exquisite young cunt he had just\r\ninitiated into love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries\xe2\x80\x94_bref_\xe2\x80\x94he stood stiff as ever, and Mary,\r\nat first with a shudder of fright, then with all the energy of awakened\r\npassion, began to move her body under me. I held off from any\r\ninterference, feeling certain that if the desire came naturally to her\r\nit would doubly enhance my own pleasure. My foresight did not fail me.\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s passions became fully aroused, and when so, the trifling soreness\r\npassed out of mind, and we actually had a most delicious fuck, in which\r\nmy prick appeared as if in a vice, and Mary wriggled her backside almost\r\nas well as the more artistic movements of Mrs. Benson. All things must\r\ncome to an end, but this did so amid screams of delight on both sides.\r\nThis single bout began and finished the education of my darling sister.\r\nShe hugged and fondled me afterwards, declaring I was quite right in\r\ntelling her pleasure followed pain; for nothing could exceed the\r\nenrapturing nature of the sensation my prick had produced. She thought\r\nnow that it was not a bit too big, but just made to give the utmost\r\nsatisfaction. We remained locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, my prick still\r\nengulphed in its tight and exciting sheath. We fondled and prattled,\r\nuntil it became again in a state of violent erection, equally\r\nstimulating her tight little cunt, so that we were forced to recommence\r\nour love encounter. I found that my dear little sister possessed\r\nnaturally the power of throbbing on or nipping a prick, which the French\r\ncall _casse-noisette_. It is a great gift and adds immensely to the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, and I should think to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s too. In my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncase it began from the very first complete insertion of my prick and the\r\nyears that I afterwards continued to fuck her added nothing to this\r\ndelicious accomplishment, except in the variety of positions in which it\r\ncould be exercised.\r\n\r\nThe dear girl was in extasies at the pleasure she had received, and at\r\nthe pain which seemed to be past. Oh! she was so sweetly caressing that\r\nI could not withdraw from her, and we fondled and toyed until again my\r\ncock rose to his first vigour, and she nothing loath, began her new and\r\nnaturally taught gift of bottom upheavings and cunt pressures until\r\nagain we sank exhausted in the death-like ending of love\xe2\x80\x99s battles. On\r\nrecovering our senses, I was obliged to withdraw and relieve my sister\r\nof the dead weight of my body on her person.\r\n\r\nIt has always struck me as extraordinary how the most delicate women\r\nwill support a heavy man on their persons, not only without flinching,\r\nbut even with ease and pleasure\xe2\x80\x94but so it is. On rising and withdrawing,\r\nwe were both alarmed to see that my prick was all bloody, and that blood\r\nand semen were oozing from her cunt. We had no idea this would be the\r\ncase, and at first I was as frightened as she was. A moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection\r\nshowed me that it was only the natural result of forcing my way in, and\r\nthat the pleasure since enjoyed proved it to be of no consequence. I\r\nsoon convinced and calmed my sister on the point\xe2\x80\x94fortunately the sofa\r\ncovering was red, and applying my handkerchief, I wiped up all the semen\r\nmixture, and, in fact, no marks remained; the same handkerchief wiped\r\nall results from Mary\xe2\x80\x99s dear little cunt, and as her shift had been kept\r\nwell up, fortunately no stains appeared upon that.\r\n\r\nWe now ate some luncheon and drank some wine that we had prudently\r\nbrought with us. We then began playing and romping together\xe2\x80\x94she wanting\r\nalways to get hold of my prick, and I to pull her about in every way. It\r\nwas gloriously warm weather, so I proposed we should off with\r\neverything. In a trice we were as naked as we were born, and flew into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms in a frenzy of delight, then we had a mutual thorough\r\ninspection. My darling sister gave every promise of becoming a\r\nmagnificent woman\xe2\x80\x94her shoulders were already wide\xe2\x80\x94her arms well shaped,\r\nalthough still thin\xe2\x80\x94her waist small\xe2\x80\x94the swell of the hips already well\r\ndeveloped\xe2\x80\x94as to her bottom, it stuck out well and hard behind, quite\r\ncharming to see, and giving promise of very ample dimensions hereafter.\r\n\r\nI made her kneel on the low couch, with her head well up and her thighs\r\nopen; kneeling behind, I gamahuched her until she spent; then rising,\r\nshoved my prick into her cunt, in her then position, and had a downright\r\ngood poke, which she, too, found was a way that gave her extra\r\nexcitement. We passed thus some hours in mutual delights. I taught her\r\nthe side fuck which had so charmed me with my delightful instructress,\r\nand I found dear Mary even an apter scholar than myself had proved. The\r\nafternoon advancing, we dressed, and eradicating all signs of what we\r\nhad been doing, returned to the house, mutually promising to keep\r\nthoroughly secret all that had passed and agreeing that no sign of\r\nunusual familiarity should escape us. I strongly advised Mary to get\r\nsome warm water and bathe her cunt well, for, as may be supposed, I had\r\ntaken the opportunity of teaching her the true erotic language as\r\napplied to the organs of generation of both sexes, and the name of the\r\nconnection itself, \xe2\x80\x9cfucking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus delightfully ended the first lesson in love taught to my sister,\r\nand such was my first triumph over a maidenhead, double enhanced by the\r\nidea of the close ties of parentage between us. In after-life, I have\r\nalways found the nearer we are related, the more this idea of incest\r\nstimulates our passions and stiffens our pricks, so that if even we be\r\nin the wane of life, fresh vigour is imparted by reason of the very fact\r\nof our evasion of conventional laws.\r\n\r\nWe had both returned to the drawing room for more than an hour before\r\nthe arrival of the ladies. Dear Mary complained of feeling sore and\r\nstiff in every limb. I had advised her to lie down on the sofa and try\r\nto sleep. I did the same, and happily we both dozed off, and never awoke\r\nuntil the loud rat-tat of arrival at the house door roused us up. I told\r\nMary to hide all appearance of pain, and only to say, as an excuse for\r\ngoing early to bed, that we had gone further afield than we at first\r\nintended, and that she was very tired. We were both sent early to bed,\r\nfor I was still treated as quite a boy, and I was sound asleep when my\r\ncharming Mrs. B. woke me up by her warm caresses. I could well have\r\nspared them that night, but when did one of my years not respond to the\r\nendearments of the woman he loved, and who yielded all to him. She\r\nsucked me dry as usual, and I slept soundly till morning.\r\n\r\nThe next three days passed without anything to record. Mary did not\r\nallow her real soreness to appear, but heroically went through her\r\nsufferings, for she told me afterwards she felt very severe pains all\r\nover, doubtless her whole nervous system had been overexcited, and this\r\nwas the natural reaction; it was so far fortunate that not a shadow of a\r\nchance of our having fresh connection occurred, so she had time to\r\nperfectly recover from the ill effects of her first initiation into the\r\nerotic raptures. I continued to have the relief each night of the\r\ncharming mouth of my loved and beautiful instructress. At last, the\r\nabominable _menses_, as she called them, were past and gone. For a full\r\ntwenty-four hours after, she would not allow me to reassume all the\r\nprivileges she had previously granted, and admit me to share her bed.\r\nShe told me this was necessary to prevent any recurrence, and also that\r\nin some cases a virulent white discharge occasionally followed for some\r\nhours, sufficiently acrid to affect my local health, and \xe2\x80\x9cthat,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cwas now too precious in her estimation to risk it in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nthought it hard at the time, but it was only another proof of the\r\nthoughtful wisdom of this estimable woman. At last, I was again in full\r\npossession of her charming person. Oh! how we did revel in all the\r\nluxuries and lubricity; almost every night my enchanting friend found\r\nsome new position to vary and enhance our erotic raptures. One new dose\r\nwas laying me down flat on my back, then straddling over me, she sank on\r\nher knees, and with body erect, lifted up or rather bent back my\r\nstiff-standing prick, until he was fairly below her open cunt, then\r\nguiding it exactly to the proper entrance, she sank her body slowly down\r\nupon it until fully engulphed, hair crushed hair, then as slowly raising\r\nagain, she drew off until all but the nut was uncovered, to again sink\r\ndown. In this position we could both see the whole process. At length,\r\nbecoming too excited, she sank on my bosom, then one arm and hand\r\npressed her splendid buttocks down on my throbbing prick after every\r\nelevation of her magnificent backside while my other hand, doubling\r\nround behind her, introduced the middle finger up her charming\r\nbottom-hole, and worked in and out in unison with both our heaving\r\nmovements, until stopped by the grand crisis, when death-like languor\r\novercame us both almost at the same moment. I must not forget to mention\r\nthat from time to time I paid a visit to the small and rosy orifice that\r\nlay so near to the more legitimate altar of Venus. It was a variety of\r\nenjoyment that my lovely mistress acknowledged to me she at times felt\r\nmuch inclined to enjoy, but only after having the front path of pleasure\r\nwell fucked and lubricated with sperm, which alone caused the other\r\nmucous membrane to feel inclined that way.\r\n\r\nI will here insert a characteristic letter from my loved mistress to her\r\nintimate and bosom school friend, with the reply thereto. It was several\r\nyears before they were shown to me, and some time after I had possessed\r\n_both_ the charming writers, for we all three became fast friends;\r\nindeed, I may call myself or rather my prick, the pivot on which their\r\nfriendship turned, yet there never was the shade of jealousy on either\r\npart, but in these remarks I am anticipating what I may, perhaps, be\r\nhereafter tempted to describe more fully. I give these letters now,\r\nbecause they immediately refer to the events I am at present relating.\r\nThey show the secret working of my loved mistress\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and the\r\nvoluptuous nature of her temperament, and the satisfaction that my\r\ndelicious initiation had given. Her affectionate and flattering remarks,\r\nrelating to myself, are greater than I deserved. The following is the\r\nfirst letter addressed to her friend:\r\n\r\nMRS. BENSON TO THE HON. MRS. EGERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Carry,\r\n\r\nI am about to keep my promise, and give you an account of our honeymoon.\r\nYou, my dear, must be equally faithful, and reply as frankly as I am now\r\nabout to write to you.\r\n\r\nTwo giddier girls than you and I never entered the bonds of matrimony,\r\nor more earnestly longed for the sights connected with it. Well, after\r\nthe usual breakfast, we left by rail for Leamington, where we were to\r\npass our first night. We had a _coup\xc3\xa9_ to ourselves; and beyond seating\r\nme on his knee, and kissing me, Fred behaved with much decency and\r\npropriety. We arrived and dined. The hour between tea and bedtime was\r\nsufficiently tedious, as both of us were naturally much preoccupied. My\r\nhusband wrote a letter to mamma, telling her of our safe arrival, and of\r\nhis intense happiness. After which he asked me if I would go to bed, in\r\nthe most matter-of-fact way imaginable. I murmured an affirmative,\r\nscarcely knowing what to say. He rang for a candle, and told me he would\r\nfollow shortly. It seemed like a dream to me. The maid showed me to a\r\nroom containing a large four-post bedstead, heavily hung with curtains,\r\nand provided with old-fashioned furniture.\r\n\r\nI seated myself on the edge of the bed and began to meditate. I sat\r\nthus, for, I dare say, ten minutes, and then commenced undressing. I had\r\nput on my nightgown, and removed everything but my stockings, when I\r\nheard footsteps approach the door. I opened, and my husband entered,\r\nclosed it, and turned the key. Oh! Carry, I did feel so funny. I was\r\nundressed in a bedroom with a man, and that man had a right to my\r\nperson. He seated himself in an armchair, and drew me on his knee.\r\nNothing but my thin nightgown separated my bottom from his bare knee,\r\nfor he had quite undressed in an adjoining room and had nothing on but\r\nhis shirt under his dressing-gown, which flew open as he sat down. He\r\ndrew my lips to his, and kissing me, thrust his tongue between them,\r\nwhile his hand first caressed and squeezed my bosom, which, you know, is\r\npretty full and well-developed; it then wandered down upon my thigh,\r\npressed and felt the fleshy form. Little by little he approached my\r\nbelly, and for a moment pressed my mount. These preliminaries are at all\r\ntimes exciting, but now they made me almost ill, so great was my\r\nconfusion. Seeing this, he drew up my nightgown, and placed his hand,\r\nfirst on my naked thigh, then on my mount, and you know, Carry dear,\r\nwhat a forest I have got there. He seemed delighted with it. His fingers\r\nplayed with the silky curls, drawing them out to their full length, so\r\nlong that it appeared to surprise him, and his eyes sparkled, and his\r\nface showed much excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen your thighs, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\nI obeyed mechanically, and his middle finger forced itself between the\r\nlips of my cunt, and commenced rubbing my clitoris. You know, by\r\nexperience, what an excitable one it is and to what a size it developes\r\nitself when excited. Again Fred seemed delighted with his discovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that please you, my darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I faltered out.\r\n\r\nHe thrust his finger up my cunt, then rose up, threw off his\r\ndressing-gown, took me in his arms, and lifted me on the bed, placing a\r\npillow under my head. Then letting my legs fall over the sides, he knelt\r\non the floor, and separating my thighs with his arms, stooped and kissed\r\nmy quim. He did more, he sucked and then licked with his tongue my\r\nalready excited clitoris. It set me on fire, and I could not avoid\r\nshowing it by the convulsive twitchings of my loins and buttocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like that, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes; so much!\xe2\x80\x94so very much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was nearly mad with the excitement he was putting me into. He again\r\nstood up, and lifting my legs, his hands pressed them again and again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat delicious legs,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI could see his shirt bulging out. He leant forward, and with his arms\r\nunder my legs, lifted them well up, and I felt a stiff thick thing\r\npressing against my cunt. His left hand opened the lips, his right hand\r\nguided it between them, and a cruel push lodged its great head\r\ncompletely within. Neither you, or I, Carry, were strictly virgins, our\r\nfingers and other means had opened our vaginas to a certain extent. We\r\nhad played too many tricks together to have left our maidenheads quite\r\nintact, so that the passage was less difficult than it might have been.\r\nNevertheless, it had never been penetrated by the male organ, and that\r\nof my husband was of the largest. I experienced, therefore, a great deal\r\nof pain, and cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear Fred, you hurt me dreadfully, what are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoing, my darling! why, I am getting into you. Have a little patience,\r\nand I will make you mad with pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother determined thrust sent him halfway, and then with another, still\r\nmore violent, he lodged himself up to the hilt within. I screamed with\r\nreal pain, and struggled to free myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, sir, you are killing me; I will not endure such\r\ntreatment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heeded me not, but holding me fast by the thighs commenced shoving in\r\nand out furiously. A sensitive woman never receives an insertion of this\r\nkind with impunity. The friction began to excite feelings that first\r\ndeadened the pain of entrance, and then began to awaken the delicious\r\nsensations of lubricity. The enjoyment I began to experience was\r\ndelicious, and I could not refrain from heaving up to meet his thrusts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right, my angel; was I not correct in saying it would soon turn\r\nfrom pain to pleasure? Do you not enjoy it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you make me feel so funny. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x94is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis increased and rapid movement filled me with delight; I bounded up\r\nand down in response to his thrusts, and felt so queer when, all of a\r\nsudden, he gasped for breath, stopped, and I felt a greater and stiffer\r\nswelling of his instrument, and then a gush of hot liquid dashed against\r\nmy womb, which continued running for some seconds. This, Carry, was my\r\nfirst experience of what a man can do for us.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing his huge affair\xe2\x80\x94for he since admits he is larger than most\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94letting go my thighs\xe2\x80\x94he pressed down upon me, and tenderly embraced\r\nme, and said that I had behaved admirably; in future there would be no\r\nmore pain, and from what he had already experienced he felt sure I was\r\nmade for the fullest enjoyment that husband and wife could indulge in.\r\nAfter a little fondling, he rose, drew off my stockings, and helped me\r\ninto bed, immediately following me. On throwing back the clothes to\r\nenter the bed, he said he must kiss the dear little hairy thing that had\r\ngiven him such pleasure. He kissed and toyed with it admiring the\r\nprofusion of hair on my mount, the whiteness and beauty of my belly, and\r\nthen, baring my breasts, admired, kissed, and sucked them. All this not\r\nonly excited me, but I could see very well it had again caused his\r\naffair to stick out. Seeing that I was timidly glancing at it, he seized\r\nmy hand, and made me lay hold of it, showed me how the skin covered and\r\nuncovered its head; then becoming rampageous, he got on my belly and\r\nbetween my thighs, and again introduced his cock to where it had already\r\ngiven such pleasure. He still rather hurt me, and made me smart for a\r\nlittle while, but as the interior was well lubricated by his former\r\ndischarge, the penetration was easily accomplished. When up to the hilt,\r\nand the two hairs were closely joined, he paused and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will take it less impatiently this time, that my darling Bessie may\r\nenter into all the joys of fucking, for that is what we call it my dear;\r\nso I shall go slowly to work until my darling\xe2\x80\x99s passions awake and\r\nurgently call for more rapid movements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did so, and gradually produced the most lascivious excitement in my\r\nwhole body. I writhed beneath him in the utmost extasy, threw my arms\r\nround his body, and hugged him to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are an angel,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand made for enjoyment. Throw your\r\nlegs also over my back\xe2\x80\x94there, that is it\xe2\x80\x94and now I will hasten my\r\nmovements, and we will die away together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, the delight he gave me was inexpressibly delicious; his rapid and\r\neager thrusts were as eagerly met by the upheaving of my bottom to\r\nreciprocate them. The grand crisis seized us simultaneously, and we sank\r\nmomentarily exhausted in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, leaving the dear exciter of\r\nsuch joys soaking within. My dear husband was so pleased, he kissed and\r\nfondled me in the sweetest manner, telling me that never woman before\r\nhad yielded him such intense pleasure, that nature had prompted me to as\r\nmuch enjoyment as if I had been already married a month.\r\n\r\nWe were locked closely in the warmest embrace; his tenderness and\r\nfondling began to have its effect on my passions, and involuntarily I\r\nmade some internal convulsive twitchings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel you, my darling, calling on my instrument for renewed efforts;\r\nhe will soon respond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, I felt it swelling and swelling so deliciously that I\r\ncould not help continuing the interior pressures, although feeling\r\nconfusedly ashamed of the notice my husband took of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, my sweetest love, but give way to whatever your\r\npassions dictate, and thus you will best please me, and give to yourself\r\ndouble enjoyment. I mean to initiate you into every secret that the\r\nrites of Venus possess, and wish that my loved wife should become a\r\ndevoted votary, and I will do my best that she may revel in all the\r\nluxuries of perfect coition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe completed this course with even greater abandon than before, and I\r\nbegan to enjoy his embraces beyond anything our imaginations used to\r\nsuggest. This time he withdrew and lay down by my side, and taking me\r\nwithin both his arms, continued his charming endearments. I never slept\r\nthat night; I was in a fever of restless excitement. My husband fucked\r\nme five times before he dozed off. Towards morning I tossed and tumbled,\r\nand could not sleep. Daylight soon came, my restlessness had shaken all\r\nthe bed clothes off, except a part of the sheet, and turning towards my\r\nhusband, I perceived that the sheet stuck up over the lower part of his\r\nbody. Curiosity seized me\xe2\x80\x94I looked at him, and saw he was evidently\r\nsleeping. So gently removing the sheet, I beheld the dear instrument of\r\nall my last night\xe2\x80\x99s joys as well as pains. You know how we used to long\r\nto see man\xe2\x80\x99s cock when we were at school, and how, when we did sometimes\r\nsee a boy\xe2\x80\x99s limp thing hanging down, we used to wonder what change would\r\ncome over it, and how. Well, here was an opportunity of examining, at my\r\nease, the wonderful curiosity that had so puzzled us. The last edge of\r\nthe sheet passing over it touched its ruby head; it throbbed and\r\npulsated to the view. I was afraid this had awakened Fred, but no, he\r\nslept as sound as ever. So I gently raised myself on my bottom, and\r\ngazed on the dear object I had so longed to see and feel. There it stood\r\nup like a pillar, rather bending towards his belly: and what surprised\r\nme much was to see a dark strongly wrinkled bag at its roots, with\r\napparently two large balls inside; the hair on its roots spread in dark\r\nmass up to his navel, and beautifully bright and curling it was. I\r\napproached my lips, and made the action of kissing, without touching it.\r\nWhether it felt my warm breath, I know not, but it actually throbbed a\r\nresponse. What a great big thing it was, equally long as it was thick, I\r\ndid not think I could encircle it with my hand; I longed to try, but was\r\nafraid I should waken Fred, and what would he think of me, I blushed at\r\nthe very idea; but my passions became excited, and too strong to resist\r\nthe temptation. So first lying gently down again, I very quietly dropped\r\nmy arm over him and touched his cock, it throbbed at the touch, but Fred\r\nslept on. So raising myself again, I very gently laid hold of it. It was\r\nas much as I could grasp below the head, but was beyond my grasp at the\r\nroot; I found it took three of my hands to measure its length from the\r\nroot to the nut, which stood out in all its redness above. I was almost\r\nbreathless with excitement, and lost some of my caution. Stooping down,\r\nI gently kissed the ruby head, when, before I knew where I was, it was\r\npushed up into my mouth, and my husband\xe2\x80\x99s voice said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you dear darling creature! how kind of you to waken me so\r\nluxuriously!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was horrified at being discovered; and blushing up to the eyes, I hid\r\nmy face in his bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be ashamed, my angel, it is now as much yours as mine, and have\r\nyou not as much right to see, kiss, and handle it? come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, I could not face him, and when he tried to raise my head I\r\nturned my back. He seized me round the waist, and, before I knew where I\r\nwas, passed a hand between my thighs, and guided his huge cock to the\r\nlips of my cunt, and was in me, I thought further than ever, in a\r\nmoment. It is true the previous toying with his instrument had terribly\r\nexcited me, and I had felt that my cunt had become very moist, but I had\r\nno idea that anything could be accomplished in that position. I was most\r\ndelightfully undeceived, for not only did it feel tighter in it, but\r\ntransferring his fingers from guiding his prick, he touched and played\r\nwith my clitoris, and produced such excessive lubricity that I went off\r\nand spent with a scream of delight before he was ready; but continuing\r\nwith finger and cock to ravish me inside and out, he soon brought me\r\nagain to such a pitch of lewdness that I was quite ready to spend with\r\nhim when the grand crisis arrived. Nothing could exceed the pleasure; my\r\ninternal pressures, he declared, were the most exquisite he had ever\r\nexperienced. My clitoris, too, he declared was quite unique. You\r\nremember how it used to stick out when excited as far as the first thumb\r\njoint, and how, when sometimes I played the husband on your belly, you\r\ndeclared that it actually entered between the lips of your cunt, rubbed\r\nagainst your smaller development, and gave you great pleasure, as indeed\r\nit gave me. My husband has often examined and sucked it, and admires it\r\nbeyond measure. At present he did not withdraw, declaring that I held\r\nhim so tight he did not think he could pull it out if he tried. In fact,\r\nit was involuntary on my part, and I could not help clinging to his dear\r\ninstrument for the life of me.\r\n\r\nOh, how he fondled and embraced me, making me partially turn my body so\r\nthat he might kiss and tongue me, and then suck my bubbies; his busy\r\nfinger all the time tickling and frigging my clitoris. I soon felt his\r\ncock swelling so deliciously within me, and he shortly recommenced his\r\nrapturous pushings in and out. We made a long, long bout of it, and I am\r\nsure that I spent twice before joining him at the last moment, when he\r\ndied away in a shout of joy that I feared must have been heard by the\r\nservants in the house, who long before this had been on the move. After\r\nthis we lay soaking and enjoying it for more than half an hour, when my\r\nhusband declared he felt as if a wolf was at his stomach, and that he\r\nmust have some breakfast. He got up and quickly dressed, desiring me to\r\nlie still, and he would bring me some breakfast in bed, and that, while\r\nit was getting ready, he would order some warm water to bathe myself\r\nwith. I felt his delicacy, and loved him for it. The water came, I was\r\nmuch refreshed after using it, and got into bed again, but I felt\r\nawfully stiff and done up all that and next day.\r\n\r\nMy darling husband waited on me himself at breakfast, stimulating me to\r\neat freely as a means of restoring my lost strength; which he very soon\r\nput to the test again, for he fucked me three times during the day, and\r\neach time he gave me greater pleasure than before. He was just as active\r\nat night. And the whole three weeks we stayed at Leamington, he never\r\nfucked me less than four times a night, declaring that I had become most\r\nperfect in the exercise.\r\n\r\nWe then came here, our old friend, Mrs. Roberts, having kindly insisted\r\nupon our paying her a long visit Fred has been called away suddenly and\r\nwill not return for a month. I am sure you will pity me, as you know my\r\ntemperament is too hot to keep chaste so long. You remember Charlie\r\nRoberts; you would consider him a child, but he is not so. One afternoon\r\nFred followed me into my bedroom, as was usual, and gamahuched and\r\nfucked me on the edge of the bed. I was about to leave the room after he\r\nwas gone, when on opening a closet, in which my dresses were hung, who\r\nshould I discover but this same Charlie. I was in a fix.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt the lad had seen everything. I spoke kindly to him,\r\nand he promised secrecy. In order to ensure it, I determined to have his\r\nmaidenhead. A few days afterwards my husband left me, and the girls with\r\ntheir mamma and the governess went to town with him, leaving Charlie to\r\nkeep me company. I went upstairs with him to the drawing room, and\r\nseating myself in a low chair, crossed my legs carelessly, exposing\r\nthem, and letting the garter and part of the bare skin of one thigh be\r\nvisible. The effect was what I expected. I saw Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed on\r\nthe exposure, he blushed scarlet, and I could distinctly see his cock\r\nswell out under his trousers. In a little while I had unbuttoned them,\r\nand, oh, Carry, would you imagine it, I found he had the cock of a man.\r\nI could scarcely believe my eyes. He is not quite fifteen, and yet he is\r\nalmost as large as Fred. Here was a godsend, indeed! I drew up my\r\npetticoats, and the gallant little fellow instantly fell on his knees,\r\nkissed and sucked my cunt. To reward him, I placed him on his back on\r\nthe couch, and got on the top of him. I took his pego into my mouth, and\r\npressed my cunt against his face, we devoured each other with our\r\nluxurious caresses until we both spent copiously. Nothing was lost, we\r\nboth greedily swallowed all we could get.\r\n\r\nAt home he is looked upon as still a child, and I had little difficulty\r\nin arranging for him to sleep in a little dressing room adjoining my\r\nbedroom, with which there is a door of communication. He was sent early\r\nto bed, but when I came I found him still awake, expecting me, and I had\r\nthe delicious treat of initiating him into the pleasures of fucking. If\r\nyou ever wish to enjoy _par excellence_ this pleasure, get hold of a\r\nvigorous boy who has never had a woman. My good fortune threw into my\r\nhands a wonderfully provided youth, whose aptitude, as well as size and\r\npowers, it would be very difficult to match. I had already given him\r\nseveral lessons in the enrapturing art when we fell asleep, and now I\r\nmust mention a little episode, which it would not do to omit.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I was dreaming of Fred, when I became conscious that\r\nsomething was entering me. I was in that half-dreaming state when it is\r\ndifficult to be quite certain what is happening, but gradually I became\r\naware that although there was no doubt I was being entered, it was not\r\nin the usual way. My husband had frequently of late pushed his prick up\r\nmy bottom-hole, and as he told me that all husbands did so, I could make\r\nno objections. I, therefore, at first took it for granted that Fred,\r\nfinding my naked bottom in his lap, could not resist the temptation of\r\nentering it. I, therefore, humoured him, and so moved my bottom as to\r\nfacilitate his complete entrance, and began to feel myself the\r\nexcitement it occasioned, but as I became wider awake, I gradually\r\ncalled to mind that Fred had left me, and that Charlie was my bedfellow.\r\nThe audacity of the young rogue paralysed me, but his delicious\r\nmovements had become too nice for me to think of dislodging him. He\r\ninsisted that he was quite unconscious of his mistake, and that he\r\nbelieved himself buried in the delicious grotto of the night before. It\r\nprobably was so, for so perfect an ignoramus as he is, although ever so\r\napt a scholar in Venus\xe2\x80\x99s rites, he could hardly have imagined there\r\ncould be any entrance in the smaller orifice. I let him go on, and with\r\nhis well hung cock in my bottom, and two or three fingers in my cunt, he\r\nfucked and frigged me most deliciously, until we both spent in an agony\r\nof pleasure. If, Carry, you have not tried this route I strongly\r\nrecommend you to do so without delay, but you must be well fucked in the\r\nfirst instance, to stimulate a desire in those parts, and your lover\r\nmust be up to the art of frigging you at the same time, or you can pass\r\nyour hand under your belly, and rub your clitoris, which was the plan I\r\nadopted with Charlie, until I taught him the art of rubbing the clitoris\r\nproperly. As there is always more excitement when this is done by a\r\nmale, it is better to have them when one can, but, _faute de mieux_\xe2\x80\x94one\r\ncan do it oneself with much additional lascivious satisfaction.\r\n\r\nTo give you an instance of the precocious aptitude of this dear little\r\nfellow, I mounted upon him one morning, keeping my body erect, that we\r\nmight see the delicious instrument in its action of being engulphed and\r\nthen withdrawn, a most exciting pose which I recommend you to try, if\r\nyour husband has not already taught it to you. At last, overcome by the\r\nlascivious movements, I sank on his bosom. He pressed my bottom down\r\nwith one hand, and with the other embracing the nearer buttock,\r\nintroduced his middle finger up the rosy orifice of my bottom, and\r\nfrigged me in unison with our ups and downs of fucking, giving me the\r\nmost delicious additional sensations.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of that for a _tyro_? His discretion, too, is\r\nextraordinary. The first night after I sent him to his own bed, he\r\noverslept himself. I had not thought of that, and had not looked into\r\nhis little room before descending to breakfast. His sister was sent to\r\ncall him. He at once excused himself by saying he had had a bad dream,\r\nshe came down and told us. In a few minutes he followed, and in the most\r\nnatural way possible, told a tale of fright, declared he had awoke\r\nscreaming and afterwards had been so frightened that he could not sleep,\r\nand turning to me in the most natural way, hoped his scream had not\r\ndisturbed me. He never came near me, or appeared in any way attracted by\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94a discretion worthy of a man of the world. Oh! my dear Carry, I shall\r\nmake a great deal of this boy. We have had several delicious nights\r\nsince, and he improves wonderfully. Splendidly as my husband fucks,\r\nCharley already beats him. He is quite as often ready, indeed, oftener,\r\nand it is I that hold him back, but there is something still so\r\ncharmingly infantine in his way of caressing me, and then the lascivious\r\nidea he is all my own, and that I initiated him in love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries,\r\nadds an inexpressible charm to our lascivious encounters. I feel that I\r\nshall almost regret my husband\xe2\x80\x99s return, as it will force me to give up\r\nthis delicious indulgence. Not the slightest shadow of suspicion of our\r\ndoings is excited in the family, thanks to the very guarded and\r\nadmirable conduct of Charlie, which is above all praise.\r\n\r\nWrite to me soon, my dear Carry, and be sure you are as candid as this\r\nlong, long letter is to you, for the life of me I could not make it\r\nshorter. I only hope you will give me one as long, and have as much\r\ndelicious intelligence for me. I know you too well to suppose that you\r\nhave not found means as I have done, to try what other men are made of,\r\nalthough you can scarcely have had such wonderful luck as mine. Write\r\nthen, and write without reserve. Our mutual affection is too sincere to\r\nallow of any concealment whatever between two such loving and lewd\r\nlascivious friends.\r\n\r\nEver your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nE. BENSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the long letter my adored mistress wrote at the time to her\r\nschool companion. It will be seen that their attachment had led to\r\nsomething more than the usual fingerings and caressings of school girls,\r\nindeed, had led them on to the lewdest and most lascivious indulgences\r\nthat two girls could practise in common, and had first excited their\r\npassions and given them the delicious power of pleasing coition they\r\nwere both so perfect in, for, as I before said, about two years after\r\nthis time, I was the possessor of both and many and many an orgy we\r\nthree had together, without the shadow of jealousy on any side. It will\r\nbe seen that Mrs. Egerton, in her reply, even looks forward to the\r\ndelicious indulgence, which in the end was happily effected and long\r\ncontinued. The following is her reply\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nTHE HON. MRS. EGERTON TO MRS. BENSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I ever sufficiently thank my darling Lizzie for her delicious\r\nletter, I have devoured its delightful details a dozen times already. I\r\nkeep it in my bosom, and renew the pleasure of its perusal at every\r\nspare moment. _Too long?_ Oh! with such a charming power of description,\r\nwhy did you not cover fifty more pages. Never in my life have I enjoyed\r\nsuch an exquisite description of those dear lascivious encounters. How\r\ndelighted I am at your good fortune in meeting with such a miracle of a\r\nboy as that dear Charlie Roberts. Why, he has every quality of a man,\r\nunited to the charm of extreme youth. What a splendid man he will\r\nbecome, the very perfection of a lover, and already possessing so lewd\r\nand lascivious a lubricity. Oh! how I envy you his possession. What luck\r\nfor him too, to have fallen into the hands of so delicious a teacher as\r\nmy beloved Lizzie is. Am I not myself her pupil, and were you not my own\r\ndelicious instructress in all that one of our sex could teach each the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nYou will remember a long-standing engagement entered into, between us\r\nmade, when we were both so lewd and so longing for the real knowledge of\r\nman, and how we pledged ourselves that if either got possession of a\r\nlover, we should manage after a while to share him between us. Your\r\ndescription of Charlie Roberts has brought this pledge most vividly to\r\nmy recollection. I am sure my dear Lizzie will not be angry or jealous\r\nwhen I avow that I long to participate with her in the possession of\r\nthat darling boy; and if my Lizzie is as of old, I feel certain she will\r\nrather indulge and cultivate this propensity than otherwise. Think how\r\neasy it will be for us both to arrange the meeting of all three\r\ntogether, because I wish to possess him in common, certain that it will\r\nincrease the lascivious pleasure of coition. No one will suspect us when\r\nwe drive out, two women with one man. It will naturally be supposed that\r\none fears the other, and so there will be no danger. See, here I am at\r\nonce anticipating future scenes, but it is all owing to the extremely\r\nexciting and lascivious details you have so vividly given me.\r\n\r\nI have no such delicious scenes to depict as those you have so\r\ndelightfully described to me. My honeymoon passed off in a much more\r\ncommon-place way than yours. Our marriage, which was performed within a\r\nday of your own, went off as such events do. My husband was loving,\r\nwithout being very warm. I felt very much as you describe on going to\r\nbed the first night, but the discretion or delicacy of my husband, which\r\nI could well have pardoned him for dispensing with, left me time not\r\nonly to get into bed, but kept me waiting there some time. He entered\r\nlike yours in his dressing-gown, but immediately put out the light and\r\nfound his way into bed, as best he could. He crept to my side and\r\nembraced me tenderly enough, and began to fondle and kiss me, telling me\r\nhow dearly he loved me, etc., but for some time he avoided any indecent\r\nliberties. I suppose he thought it necessary to gain my confidence and\r\nquiet any alarm I might be in. He might have saved himself the trouble,\r\nfor in reality I was longing for and at the same time somewhat dreading\r\nan attack on my maiden charms. At last, little by little, he approached\r\nthe object of delight, and eventually begging me not to be alarmed, he\r\nmounted upon me and effected the object of his desires. He did not hurt\r\nme much, not nearly as much as I expected, nor so much as you seem to\r\nhave suffered. I deemed it politic to affect more suffering than he\r\nreally inflicted. Towards the end I had slight scintillations of\r\npleasure, but not worth mentioning; it is true my husband is not so\r\nwell-armed as yours and Charlie appear to be, and he is also much colder\r\nin his passions; for instance, he did not attempt to fuck me again,\r\nalthough I would have been gratified if he had done so; perhaps it was\r\nconsiderate towards me in his idea, but, merely embracing me in his\r\narms, he talked himself and me to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he again fucked me, this time giving me something like\r\npleasure, but I was altogether disappointed with my night\xe2\x80\x99s experience.\r\nIt was not such as you or I, my dear Lizzie, had pictured to ourselves,\r\nin our anticipations of the marriage night. My husband since has never\r\nexceeded twice a night, but he has become more exciting, and has\r\ngenerally made me spend twice to his once, first exciting my passions by\r\nfeeling all my private parts, and frigging my clitoris, so that I\r\ngenerally have lubricated the passage by my own discharge before he\r\nattempts to make an entrance. I find he likes this, and so far it\r\npleases me, because only one discharge would leave me in a state of\r\nexcitement unbearable. He has never attempted any of those lewder and\r\nmore lascivious methods, of which you have had such delicious\r\nexperience. Altogether, I cannot but say I am disappointed. My husband\r\nis loving, and very anxious that I should improve my mind in every way.\r\nYou know I was rather more proficient than usual at school in Italian.\r\nMy husband speaks it fluently, and as we mean to spend a winter at Rome,\r\nwas anxious that I should have further instruction. He asked me if my\r\nschool teacher was a good one, but I did not encourage that idea. You\r\nmay remember our former master was a Count Fortunio, so handsome and so\r\nenterprising that you and I had both formed the plan of having him, and\r\nhad already put over some of the preliminaries when, unfortunately, he\r\nwas caught with that impudent Miss Peace, with whom, doubtless, he had\r\naccomplished everything. Of course, he was instantly changed for\r\nanother, and we saw no more of him, to the sad disappointment of our\r\nthen libidinous hopes. My husband proposed advertising for a master,\r\nwhen I had the happy instinct to tell him that schoolmistresses\r\ngenerally applied to Rolandi, of Berner\xe2\x80\x99s Street, for language masters,\r\nand that, if he would write or call, he would be sure to get every\r\ninformation. That evening, after dinner, as we sat dozing over the fire\r\nin the library\xe2\x80\x94very imperfectly lighted\xe2\x80\x94my husband informed me that he\r\nhad seen Rolandi, who had most strongly recommended a very gentlemanly\r\nman, moving in good society, namely, the Count Fortunio. I started in\r\namazement; fortunately, owing to the half-light we were in, my surprise\r\nand confusion were unnoticed by my husband. He said that he had been\r\nreferred to one or two gentlemen of standing as to the Count\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter, that he called upon them, and felt satisfied that I could not\r\nbe in better hands. You may imagine what an effect this information had\r\nupon me. All night long I could think of nothing else. What seemed most\r\ndifficult to me was the hiding from my husband our previous knowledge of\r\neach other. I feared the Count would at once recognise me and claim\r\nacquaintance, which was what I most wished to avoid; to you, from whom I\r\nhave no secrets, I may own it immediately occurred to me that this would\r\nbe an opportunity (for which I had in heart been longing) of obtaining\r\nthe services of a lover I could trust. How to manage it I knew not, but\r\nchance, that favourer of all wrongdoers, stood me in good stead.\r\n\r\nMy husband had intended to be present to receive the Count. Fortunately,\r\na letter arrived in the morning requiring his instant attendance in the\r\nCity about the sale of some stock, of which he was trustee. He begged me\r\nto see the Count, and arranged as to hours of attendance, &amp;c., the more\r\nfrequently the better. I felt my embarrassment was at an end; the next\r\nthing was to avoid letting the servants, those domestic spies on our\r\nconduct, see the first meeting. There was a small room off our drawing\r\nroom that had no door but the opening into the drawing room; this was\r\nfitted up as a sort of boudoir writing room, and my husband had pointed\r\nit out as a convenient place for me to take my lessons in. Here,\r\ntherefore, I posted myself, and awaited the hour of arrival, to which he\r\nwas punctual. He was announced and I told the servants to show him in. I\r\nsat purposely with my back to the entrance, apparently engaged in\r\nwriting, as if I did not know he had approached, until I heard the door\r\nof the drawing room shut. I then rose, turned, and smilingly held out my\r\nhand. He started with surprise, but immediately and gallantly kissed the\r\nhand held out to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you are not disappointed in finding who is going to be your\r\npupil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, certainly not; I did not know you under your married name; but\r\nI am so happy to renew an acquaintance which at one time had such\r\ncharming promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, signor, I am now married, and it is necessary to be very\r\ncautious. I do not wish to deny that I am much pleased to renew\r\nacquaintance with you, but it must be with great reserve. Sit down by my\r\nside, and be reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReasonable! and by the side of one whom I so much loved, and from whom\r\nI had such hope. Oh! dear Mrs. Egerton, you are surely not going to\r\ntreat me as a mere master. You would render me miserable if you did so.\r\nHow can I help admiring one whom I so fondly loved, and with whom I\r\nhoped for such happiness long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, having possession of my hand, his other arm was passed round my\r\nwaist, and he drew me to his lips, and I must own, I reciprocated the\r\nardent kiss he gave me. You remember how handsome he is, and how soft\r\nand loving was the expression of his eyes. Well, my dear, to cut matters\r\nshort, I was so excited that I hardly observed that he had passed his\r\nhand up to my petticoats, until I found he had got it on my mount. My\r\npassions being excited, and knowing that my husband could not return,\r\nand also that he had given strict orders that I was not to be disturbed\r\nin my Italian lessons, I gave way unreservedly to the excitement the\r\nCount raised. Before I well knew where I was, he was on his knees in\r\nfront of the low chair on which I was seated. He had thrown up my\r\npetticoats, and I felt a long and extremely hard prick rush up my cunt,\r\nand begin the most lively action. In fact, he carried me (not\r\nunwillingly I must avow) by storm, and made haste to secure the fortress\r\nat once, so that I had a very quick fuck, that did not assuage the fire\r\nhe had raised within me. He has since apologised for his haste, saying\r\nthat he wished to secure possession of me before I could think of\r\nresistance, so as to ensure more facilities of connection hereafter. We\r\nhad no lesson in language that day, but another bout of love, in which\r\nhe did his utmost, and with perfect success, to give me the most\r\ndelicious enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn fact, my dear Lizzie, I may say it was the first fuck that thoroughly\r\nrealised my, or rather our, anticipations of the act. We arranged the\r\nline of conduct necessary to be followed so as neither to compromise me\r\nor him either. In a short time we had again a delicious fuck. Seated,\r\nwith outstretched legs, on a chair, he got me to straddle over him, and\r\nsink down on his stiff upstanding prick. I have tried this position\r\nkneeling, with my husband on his back; but it does not equal the chair\r\nfuck. One has so much better a spring from one\xe2\x80\x99s feet than from one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknees, besides, the man is brought more face to face, and there is more\r\nfacility for mutual embracings; but both ways have their charm. I had\r\nrepeatedly observed that the Count apparently lost his place, and on\r\nrecovering it, partially penetrated the smaller orifice, which you so\r\npicturesquely describe. I thought it accident, and as it hurt, I always\r\nput him back, and joked him on his awkwardness. But after I read your\r\ndear delightful letter. I became convinced that he had a wish to\r\npenetrate there, without the courage to tell me so.\r\n\r\nI must confess to you, that our stolen embraces at home had become too\r\nunsatisfactory, and the Count had arranged for a private house to be at\r\nour disposal. Of an afternoon I drove out shopping, called at Swan and\r\nEdgar\xe2\x80\x99s in Regent Street, leaving the carriage at the door, walked\r\nupstairs, made some trifling purchase, paid for and left it until I\r\nshould call in an hour; then descending by another staircase, left by\r\nthe Piccadilly entrance, and taking a cab, joined my expectant lover,\r\nwhere he was waiting for me. There stripping perfectly naked, we enjoyed\r\neach other most lasciviously, and practised every act of lubricity. When\r\nsatiated with our efforts, a second cab conducted me to St. James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassage, in Jermyn Street, from whence I gained on foot Swan and Edgar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Piccadilly, received my parcel, and rejoined my carriage. Thus no\r\nsuspicions were excited, either in the household or otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe have met thrice since your dear delicious letter fired my\r\nimagination, and I have seized the occasion to taste the sweets of the\r\nneighbouring altar to Venus\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate one. After the Count had fucked\r\nme twice I turned my back as if wishing it in a way we often enjoyed it,\r\nbut took care to place my bottom in such a position that the smaller\r\norifice was nearest to his standing prick. Whether he saw my drift I\r\nknow not, but finding with his finger how conveniently it lay, he\r\nplunged boldly forward, and half sheathed himself at the first push. I\r\nstarted with the sudden pain, and should have disengaged myself at once,\r\nnotwithstanding that I purposely placed myself to receive his prick in\r\nmy bottom-hole, but with his arms round my waist I was perfectly\r\npowerless, and another thrust sent him up to the hilt, but really\r\nhurting me most sensitively; I begged him to desist and withdraw, but he\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will remain quite quiet for a time, and you will see that your pain\r\nwill diminish, and then you will like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help myself, and sure enough he was right. Shortly I felt no\r\npain; slipping one hand down, he began to frig my clitoris, and in a\r\nlittle time, finding by the involuntary movements of my loins that my\r\npassions were excited, he began to move very slightly and slowly. I soon\r\nfound a strange excitement seize me, which increased to such a degree\r\nthat I almost fainted, when my nature gave down its divinest essence. We\r\nhave since repeated the new experience, but I quite agree with you in\r\nthinking that we must be well fucked first.\r\n\r\nThe Count is a master of his weapon, which, neither quite so long as you\r\ndescribe your husband\xe2\x80\x99s nor nearly so thick at the point, is very much\r\nso at the root, and as stiff and hard as iron. I assure you, the wild\r\nexcess of passion he drives me into is indescribable. You shall\r\nexperience the delight of his fucking, for, with you and me, there must\r\nbe no difficulty, diversion, nor jealousy. Nay, I shall try to seduce\r\nyour husband, with a view to cover our delinquencies. I would offer you\r\nmine, but, truly, he is not worth having to a woman who can find better,\r\nas my dear Lizzie so charmingly does. We have managed matters so\r\nprudently that my husband has taken a great fancy to the Count, and he\r\ndines frequently at our house.\r\n\r\nWe have often talked of you. I told him of your marriage, and of a\r\nprobability of your eventually settling in London. I marked the sparkle\r\nof his eyes at the news, but was silent as to your letter and\r\nadventures. It is better we should manage the affair between us when you\r\nare here.\r\n\r\nSo you see, after all, I have not come off so badly, although, I must\r\nsay, tamely in comparison with the delicious adventures of my dear and\r\ncharming Lizzie. I think, when we meet, we shall be able to get up\r\nparties of the most delightful kind. I even hope we may induce the Count\r\nto join you and Charlie in a _partie carr\xc3\xa9e_; what fun and pleasure we\r\nshould have, and then the delight of exchanging lovers at each bout. Oh!\r\nthe very idea has set me on fire; fortunately, I am expecting my lover\r\nat every moment. I will close my letter with this lascivious picture,\r\nand in hopes of some day realizing it with my loved Lizzie, Whose most\r\naffectionate and attached friend,\r\n\r\nI shall ever remain,\r\n\r\nCARRY EGERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were these two charming letters, and I may immediately mention now\r\nthat the lascivious picture dear Carry drew of a _partie carr\xc3\xa9e_\xe2\x80\x94we four\r\nthe actors\xe2\x80\x94was afterwards realised to the utmost extent of every\r\nsalacious enjoyment that the most experienced lubricity could suggest.\r\n\r\nThe Count and I often sandwiched them between us, which they declared to\r\nbe the _ne plus ultra_ of pleasure, while the upper operator gamahuched\r\nthe unoccupied quim. Nay, these giddy delicious creatures were not\r\nsatisfied until they had induced us to alternate the joys of coition\r\nwith each other; but that was rarely the case. These enchanting women\r\nwere so exquisitely seductive that, while we had them at our disposal,\r\nwe sought no other source of delight. But I am digressing, and talking\r\nof events that occurred long after the period which I am more\r\nparticularly describing.\r\n\r\nThe three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 absence of Mr. Benson terminated, alas, far too soon;\r\nin fact, time flew so quick that it hardly appeared three days when a\r\nletter arrived announcing his return for the next day. My heart was\r\nready to burst, but I managed to make no show or mention when Mrs. B.\r\ntold the news at breakfast. Mrs. B. observed that I turned pale, but no\r\none else remarked anything. We contrived to meet for a short time in the\r\nmiddle of the day, and she embraced me tenderly, with tears in her eyes,\r\nand looking so loving that my passions became overexcited, and hers too.\r\nNotwithstanding the imprudence of the risk, we there and then had a most\r\ndelightful and salacious fuck; and at night this charming woman allowed\r\nme full liberty to do anything I liked; and as often as nature would\r\nsupport us we revelled in a sea of lubricity. How often I cannot say,\r\nalthough my loved mistress declared that I had spent ten times, I am\r\ncertain she did oftener than that, for neither closed an eye, nor ceased\r\nfrom the most loving embraces. She exerted all the wonderful powers of\r\nseduction for which she was so distinguished. Never mortal man could\r\nhave passed a more intoxicating night of pleasure. We heard movements in\r\nthe house before we parted with mutual tears coursing down our cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty I tore myself from her; indeed, I could not have\r\ndone so if she had not herself risen, and tenderly embracing me, told me\r\nto have courage and hope, for, somehow or other, we should manage an\r\noccasional interview. Particularly cautioning me to be perfectly on my\r\nguard when her husband came, she said it would be better if I kept out\r\nof the way until after the first interview was over, as it might be too\r\nmuch for me to see him embrace her. I did as she desired. No one noticed\r\nme in the confusion of his arrival.\r\n\r\nMamma had insisted upon my returning to my bed in her room, as she was\r\nsure Mr. Benson would require the dressing room. Mrs. B., from policy,\r\nobjected, saying that there was no occasion, that I had been so quiet\r\nshe had never once been conscious of my being there, &amp;c., but mamma had\r\nher own way, and I really believe very much to the satisfaction of Mrs.\r\nB. herself; for I doubt, if Mr. B. had been aware of my close proximity,\r\nwhether he would altogether have liked it. Nevertheless, he so\r\ncompletely treated me as little more than a child that I am quite sure\r\nhe had no suspicion of my having occupied his place so continuously\r\nduring his absence.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. B. retired shortly after his arrival, doubtless to plunge\r\ninto all the joys of venery after his long absence, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupposed privation of them. The idea of that being the case did not so\r\nmuch annoy me as I expected; on the contrary, imagination portrayed them\r\nin all the agonies of delight, and actually excited me extremely. All at\r\nonce, the idea struck me that I might be purposely hid in the closet,\r\nbehold all their delicious encounters, and when he had left his wife to\r\nput herself to rights, and the key was turned upon him, I might then in\r\nmy turn, fly into my enchanting mistress\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and revel in all the\r\njoys her well moistened and juicy cunt could give. I determined to\r\npropose this to dear Mrs. Benson the first moment I could get her apart\r\nfrom all observation.\r\n\r\nI was a little _distrait_ in the schoolroom that day, but an appeal from\r\nMiss Evelyn recalled me to my senses. She asked me what I could be\r\nthinking of; I held down my head and blushed. Already an adept in\r\ndissimulation, I faltered out that it was of herself and of her\r\nendearing caresses the day before, which had made me feel so queer all\r\nover. In fact, the previous day she had hugged me rather close to her,\r\nand kissed me more lovingly than usual, which really had, at the time,\r\ninflamed my desires, and given me great hope of matters coming to a more\r\nsatisfactory termination with her. She patted my check, and kissed me\r\nagain, saying I was a naughty boy to have any such thoughts, and I must\r\nnot indulge in them, or she would not love me any more. But there was a\r\nsparkle in her eye, and a flush on her cheek, which showed me she was\r\nanything but displeased.\r\n\r\nAt our usual break up at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I went to the parlour to see if,\r\nby chance, I could get a secret word with Mrs. B., but found that she\r\nand her husband had again retired. I knew what that meant; it set me too\r\non fire, and I flew to the garden where my sisters had gone to play. I\r\ngave Mary a hint, which she readily understood, and proposed a game of\r\nhide and seek. To prevent Eliza interrupting us, I took up a stone,\r\nwhich I furtively dropped again, and proposed that Eliza should guess\r\nfirst, in which hand I had got it, and if she guessed wrong she was to\r\nbe the seeker. Of course, she guessed wrong. So we bound up her eyes,\r\nand she was to stand behind a tree and count one hundred before she\r\nattempted to look for or seek us. We made a detour, and as fast as we\r\ncould run reached the summer house, which, as all the ladies were in the\r\nhouse occupied, I knew to be untenanted. We entered and locked the door,\r\nin an instant I had Mary down on her back on the sofa, my head between\r\nher thighs, and my tongue in her cunt, and then on her clitoris. She was\r\nas eager for it as myself. A week had passed since the happy day of\r\ngiving up her maidenhead to me. She had thoroughly got over all the\r\npains and inconveniences of that day, and was as ready for a renewal of\r\nwhat could only be joys now as I was. She spent in my mouth almost as\r\nsoon as I began to gamahuche her clitoris. Waiting an instant to lick up\r\nand swallow the soft and delicious young discharge, I rose, pulled out\r\nmy bursting prick, and engulphed it in her well-moistened sheath with\r\none rapturous shove up to the hilt, positively taking away her breath by\r\nthe energy of the attack. I was almost as rapid in coming to a\r\nconclusion as she had been. Nevertheless, she died away a second time,\r\nthe moment she felt the warm gush of my raging discharge. We lay some\r\nminutes rapt in the lascivious lap of lubricity. But in our young and\r\nunbroken energies, nature soon reasserted her power. I must give my\r\nsister the palm. It was the internal pressures of the inner folds of her\r\ndeliciously tight cunt that first awakened my vigour. Somewhat more\r\nslowly we began another love encounter, which speedily became much more\r\nrapid and energetic, ending as usual in an extasy of delight, and\r\nclosing with actual cries of intense pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was well we had completed our second course, for we heard the\r\nfootsteps of Eliza, who, after in vain searching for us near to where we\r\nhad left her, had at last sought us in the summer house. I had just time\r\nto arrange my trousers and unlock the door when she arrived and burst in\r\nupon us. She said it was unfair to go so far away, but we only laughed,\r\nand proposed that Mary should now seek us. We were standing outside\r\nbelow the mound, tying on the handkerchief, when Miss Evelyn was seen\r\napproaching. She came up and noticed the flush still on Mary\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks,\r\nbut we at once told her that we had been playing at hide and seek, and\r\nhad had a good run, and that it was now Mary\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be the seeker.\r\nHowever, Miss Evelyn said she thought we had had enough exercise for the\r\ntime, and that it would be better to walk gently about to get cool, as\r\nit only wanted a few minutes of the hour for renewing our lessons, so we\r\nall demurely returned to the house. A reflection struck me that it would\r\nbe necessary to initiate my sister Eliza in our secrets, and although\r\nshe might be too young for the complete insertion of my increasingly\r\nlarge cock, I might gamahuche her while fucking Mary, and give her\r\nintense pleasure. In this way we could retire without difficulty to\r\nspots where we should be quite in safety, and even when such was not the\r\ncase, we could employ Eliza as a watch, to give us early notice of\r\nanyone approaching. It will be seen that this idea was afterwards most\r\nsuccessfully carried out to the immense increase of my pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely summer evening. After dinner Mr. B., who, doubtless, had\r\nno longer any amorous longing, after having twice retired during the\r\nday, challenged Miss Evelyn to a game at chess, of which she was a great\r\nproficient. Mamma, Mrs. B., and the two girls stepped out into the\r\nflower garden, to enjoy the beauty of the evening. Fortunately mamma\r\nfancied she felt chilly, and shortly went back again, taking the two\r\ngirls with her, and setting Mary down to the piano. I seized the happy\r\nmoment, and drew Mrs. B. to a seat, far removed beyond the hearing of\r\nany listeners, but in sight of the windows. There I unfolded to her the\r\nplan I had proposed to myself; she smiled at my precocious ingenuity,\r\nbut added it would not be safe to leave the closet door open, even\r\npartially, as by chance Mr. B. might open it, and that would never do;\r\nbut she might lock me in\xe2\x80\x94or rather I might do so from the inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhh! but then I want to see it all\xe2\x80\x94it is so exciting to see Mr. B.\r\nworking into that divine body of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed heartily at my remark, and said I was a lewd lascivious\r\nyoung rascal\xe2\x80\x94adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you not jealous to see another in possession of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI admitted that that was my first impression, but on thinking over it, I\r\nhad become convinced I should like her and enjoy her all the more\r\nlasciviously if I were a witness to their love contests, but I must be\r\nable to see them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! can you not bore a couple of holes an inch and a half apart,\r\nbelow the middle panel and cut a narrow slit from hole to hole? I will\r\ntake care to place myself in a proper position, and do my best to\r\ngratify your premature lubricity. My darling boy, you progress\r\nwonderfully, and make me proud of my pupil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing she took it thus kindly, I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me, my beloved mistress, how often he has fucked you today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it please you really, my dear Charlie, to know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, six times in the morning, and four before dinner. He was\r\nbursting with desire, and could not hold. He spent twice before giving\r\nme time to come once, but then you know, my dear Charlie, how actively\r\nyou had been employing your time all the previous night, you sad rogue\r\nthat you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you enjoy it much, my dear Mrs. B.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if I must tell you, you little curiosity box, I did; you know how\r\npowerfully my husband is hung, and loving him as I do, it is impossible\r\nto undergo his powerful and lascivious embraces without feeling all\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s libidinous passions stirred up within me, but even while in his\r\npossession, my dear boy, I thought of your young charms, and the fierce\r\ndelights we had enjoyed together last night. My husband little imagined\r\nit was of you, not him, that I was thinking and stimulating myself to\r\nwild upheavings of voluptuous movements, while he was revelling in all\r\nthe lubricity of his own passions, and fucking me to my heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how delicious! my angelic mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pleasure of your\r\nvivid description almost makes me faint with desire\xe2\x80\x94oh! that I could\r\npossess you at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not think of that, my dear darling boy. We must manage it\r\ntomorrow; I shall go into the house at once, and occupy your mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention, do you get a gimlet and chisel, slip up at once to my\r\nbedroom, and prepare a peephole for tomorrow; be careful to put it low\r\ndown, below the projection of the middle panel of the door in which the\r\nlock is placed, and take care to remove the pieces of wood you take out.\r\nI shall put the key inside of the door. Your sisters always take two\r\nhours at the piano after your midday meal, our luncheon is served at the\r\nsame time. Mr. B. is sure to require my attendance in my room after\r\nthat, but I shall detain him by some excuse till I observe that you have\r\ndisappeared, and after giving you sufficient time, we shall follow, and\r\nyou shall have the extraordinary satisfaction you require; but above all\r\nremember\xe2\x80\x94not a movement to betray yourself until my husband leaves and I\r\nhave locked the door behind him.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, she pressed her lovely hand\r\non my stiffly excited member, rose and joined mamma. I lost no time in\r\nfollowing her advice, and happily executed all I wanted, and returned\r\nunconcernedly to the drawing room, without my absence having occasioned\r\nany remark. Next day I got safely to my hiding-room, and had comfortably\r\nstowed myself away in such a position that the opening I had made was on\r\na level with my eyes, before they arrived. She, dear creature,\r\nanticipating my vista, had merely slipped on a dress, without a corset,\r\nand told her husband that he was so insatiate that she was obliged to be\r\nready at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice to satisfy his inordinate passion, so she had\r\nonly to take off her gown to be at her ease. \xe2\x80\x9cMost admirable, my darling\r\nwife, but drop off everything, and let me contemplate, at my ease, all\r\nthe beauties of your exquisite body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done, and my lovely mistress stood in all the glory\r\nof her magnificent and beautiful naked form. He kissed and fondled her\r\nfrom head to foot, laid her on the bed and gamahuched her till she\r\nsquealed again with pleasure. Then pulling out his magnificent prick, he\r\nplunged it into her delicious cunt at a single bound, evidently giving\r\nher the most exquisite delight, as was evidenced by the instantaneous\r\nclasping of him with her arms and legs, and the rapid wriggling of her\r\nbackside. They soon ran a first course, but Mr. B. remained engulphed in\r\nthe closely fitting sheath of his salacious wife. She evidently exerted\r\nherself more than usual, both for her own pleasure as well as to give\r\nsatisfaction to me, for once when she turned her head in my direction I\r\ncaught her eyes, and she smiled, giving a still more vigorous heave than\r\nusual, and showing me all her cunt at full stretch with the noble prick\r\nin it. I was ready to burst. At last their bout was over for the\r\npresent; Mr. B. withdrew his prick, all slimy from its sheath, pendant,\r\nbut still full of size.\r\n\r\nMost extraordinary! I would have given a good deal to have dared to rush\r\nout, put it in my mouth and suck it dry, I can hardly describe how\r\nstrongly this desire took possession of me. It was the first promptings\r\nof a passion I have since often indulged in, where I have met with\r\ncompanions with whom I could join in orgies of both sexes. Mrs. B.\r\nprofessed to be dead beaten by the constant and frequent renewals of\r\nthese interviews in addition to night work and lay perfectly still,\r\nwhile he performed his ablutions and readjusted, his habiliments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFasten the door after me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he ardently pressed her form in\r\nhis arms and kissed her. She had continued stretched on the bed, exactly\r\nfacing me, with legs widely extended, so as to show me the whole of her\r\nlovely cunt, which I could see still panted under its late excitement.\r\nMy charming mistress told me it was palpitating not for what had passed,\r\nbut for what it was waiting for. She rose at last and closed the door,\r\nturning the key upon her husband. She then approached the bidet to\r\npurify herself, but I bounded from the closet, seized her in my arms,\r\ndashed her back on the bed and immediately glued my lips to her glowing\r\nand foaming cunt, with all the froth and spending of her husband oozing\r\nout. I greedily devoured it, and raised her to such a frenzy of lewdness\r\nthat she dragged me up and cried, frantically\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake fuck me\xe2\x80\x94fuck me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course my cock was bursting to do so; with one shove he was sheathed\r\nto the cods; my loved mistress spent with that alone, so highly was she\r\nexcited, not only by the preparations, but as she herself acknowledged\r\nto me, by the idea of the instantaneous infidelity to her husband, at\r\nthe moment after he had just fucked her\xe2\x80\x94such is the wild imagination of\r\nwomen when they give way to every libidinous thought. It would have been\r\nexactly the same if some equally fortunate lover had been awaiting my\r\nretiring from the field. The idea of success in deception is a passion\r\nwith them, and they would almost sacrifice anything to obtain it. Before\r\nI could arrive at the grand crisis, she was again ready, and we died\r\naway in an agony of blissful lubricity\xe2\x80\x94she held me, as usual, so tight\r\nthat I never thought of withdrawing from the folds of her delicious\r\ncunt, but lay still enjoying the never ceasing compressions of its\r\nvelvety folds, which sometimes really had almost the force of a vice. I\r\nwas rapidly ready for a second bout, which, like the first, ended in\r\nextatic joys, beyond the power of description. My charming mistress\r\nthought I ought now to desist, but pleading my forty hours\xe2\x80\x99 fast (for,\r\nof course, she knew nothing of my fucking Mary), I begged her to allow\r\nme to run one more course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my darling Charlie, you must let me turn on my side, for I am so\r\nheated with your weight and my husband\xe2\x80\x99s that I must have some relief,\r\nbut there is no occasion for you to withdraw, leave me to manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an art quite her own, she accomplished her object, her splendid\r\nbuttocks\xe2\x80\x99 pressing before my eyes against my belly fired me immediately.\r\nMy cock swelled and stood firm as ever. Then passing an arm round her\r\nbody, I used my fingers on her excited and stiffly projecting clitoris.\r\nWe had a much longer and more voluptuous fuck than before; nothing could\r\nexceed the delicious movements of my divine mistress; she twisted her\r\nbody so, that I could suck one of her bubbies, while I fucked and\r\nfrigged her; she spent with such a scream of delight that I am sure she\r\nmust have been heard in the house, had it not been for the inner baize\r\ndoor to the room. She continued throbbing so deliciously on my prick\r\nthat I began to flatter myself I should obtain a fourth favour, but she\r\nsuddenly bolted out of my arms and out of bed. Turning round, and taking\r\nmy whole prick into her mouth, and giving it a voluptuous suck, she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my loved boy, we must be prudent if we mean to have a repetition of\r\nthese most exquisite interviews. You have given me most extatic\r\npleasure, and by moderation, and running no risk in too long indulgence\r\nof our passions, we may safely manage to enjoy similar interviews every\r\nday. Get into the dressing room, remain there until I leave my room and\r\npass your door. After I have seen that no one is near, I will cough\r\ntwice, wait a minute longer, then quietly leave and descend by the back\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll was happily effected, and for the week longer they remained with us,\r\nI found means to repeat the charming lesson every day, without raising\r\nsuspicion in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nAt last this admirable woman departed. It was with difficulty I could\r\nbear the scene, but I gulphed down my feelings as best I could. She had\r\nbecome a universal favourite, and all regretted her leaving, so that my\r\ndistress was not noticed in the general regret. It was more than two\r\nyears before fortune favoured me in again meeting with this charming\r\nwoman. And then we saw very much of each other, both alone and with\r\nother congenial spirits, of which, perhaps, I may hereafter write a\r\ndetail; but at present I have got events to relate that followed fast on\r\nher departure.\r\n\r\nI have said that Miss Evelyn had been gradually growing more familiar in\r\nher manner of partially caressing me. She drew me closer to her, almost\r\ninvariably placing her arm round my waist, frequently kissing and\r\npressing me against her firm and well-formed bosom. This had frequently\r\nan evident effect on my lower person, even while I was kept less\r\nexcitable by the constant relief my passions were obtaining in the arms\r\nof my adored Mrs. B. Now I no longer had that vent, for the little\r\nrelief I could get at rare intervals from my sister Mary was as nothing,\r\nafter the constant exercise I had been provided with for a whole month.\r\nEver since I had practised that little deception on Miss Evelyn by\r\nattributing to her embraces the evident distraction I was in on the day\r\nof Mr. Benson\xe2\x80\x99s return, she had increased her pressures of my person,\r\nand could not but feel my stiff prick throbbing against her thigh, while\r\nshe closely pressed my body against it with her arm. I often noted the\r\nincreased sparkle of her eyes and changes of colour on her face when she\r\nkissed me, and I put up my hand and caressed her cheek. At times she\r\nwould push me suddenly away, and beg me to resume my seat; frequently\r\nshe would quit the room in an agitated manner, till this led me to\r\nsuppose that an internal conflict was going on, and that passion urged\r\none course, reason another. Remembering the sage advice given to me by\r\nmy loved and beautiful mistress, Mrs. B., I resolved to play the part of\r\nan innocent ignoramus, and let her own passions develop and produce the\r\nresult I so longed for. I doubt if I could have held out but for the\r\nrelief I found in dear Mary\xe2\x80\x99s embraces, who, each time we could manage\r\nto meet, became more and more attractive, and more capable of giving and\r\nreceiving pleasure. We had some difficulty in keeping Eliza blind to our\r\ndoings. At last Mary agreed to initiate her into gamahuching, and to\r\ntell her I did so to her when we shut ourselves up together, and that if\r\nshe would keep the secret, I would do the same to her; but that it was\r\nnecessary that one should keep watch while the other amused herself with\r\nme, for fear Miss Evelyn should chance to come. Mary proceeded to\r\ngamahuche her, which delighted Eliza beyond measure; indeed, although a\r\nyear and a half younger, she speedily showed a developement of passion\r\nsuperior to Mary. At first I only gamahuched her, letting her play with\r\nmy prick as I did so, but not attempting to instruct her in the art of\r\ninsertion into her charming little quim, which already showed symptoms\r\nof a hairy growth on her well-formed and very prominent mount. When I\r\nhad done enough in this way, Mary, who had previously been fucked by me,\r\nreturned, and Eliza took up the watch, while I appeased in Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeliciously tight cunt the thirst that gamahuching Eliza had raised.\r\n\r\nIt was thus I could more coolly await the gradual approximation that\r\nMiss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s evident passion for me was bringing about. That she\r\nstruggled against it was evident, but passion was gaining the advantage,\r\nas was shown by her nervous tremblings and sudden clutches, drawing me\r\nup to her parched lips, and sometimes pushing me away with a shudder\r\nthat shook her frame and paled her lovely cheeks. I fancied that nature\r\nhad been too much for her on these occasions, and that in reality the\r\nsudden clutching was the approach of love\xe2\x80\x99s crisis, and that when she\r\nshuddered, and suddenly repulsed me, she was discharging. It was evident\r\nthis could not continue. At last the happy day for which I so longed\r\narrived. Mamma was going to go to the town, and taking my two sisters\r\nwith her, to get something or other for them. She invited Miss Evelyn to\r\naccompany her, but the latter declined, on the excuse of an alleged\r\nheadache. In truth, the violent nature of the conflict going on between\r\nher passions and her prudence had visibly affected her health; she had\r\nbecome pale and anxious-looking, and my mother was somewhat uneasy about\r\nher. She told her not to occupy herself too much with my lessons that\r\nday, and only give me work for an hour in the morning and an hour in the\r\nafternoon, and begged her to take a quiet stroll in the garden, and rest\r\nas much as possible.\r\n\r\nOn leaving us, she cautioned me to be as gentle and obedient as\r\npossible, as Miss Evelyn was poorly and out of spirits. Mamma and the\r\ngirls departed. Miss Evelyn, almost as pale as death, and quite visibly\r\ntrembling, falteringly begged me to go to our schoolroom and study the\r\nlesson she had given me the previous evening, saying she would join me\r\nshortly. I went, but no lesson could I do that day. The evident\r\nagitation and apparent illness of Miss Evelyn distressed if not alarmed\r\nme; I was still too inexperienced in her mind. It was a phase of woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature which I had as yet no knowledge of. I had merely a vague kind of\r\nidea that it all tended to the ultimate gratification of my libidinous\r\nhopes, and I only held off to a certain extent in obedience to the\r\ncounsel my loved Mrs. Benson had so wisely impressed upon me, and was\r\nwaiting in lively hopes of the result I so ardently wished for.\r\n\r\nAt last Miss Evelyn joined me, her eyes were swollen and red as if she\r\nhad been weeping; my own filled with tears when I saw her, and I\r\napproached, hesitatingly, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear governess, I am so grieved to see you look so poorly. Oh,\r\ndo nothing today, and I promise to work twice as hard tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment I really felt quite distressed at the sad expression of\r\nher features. For an instant she smiled languidly, then, by some\r\ncompulsion of feeling, she seized me in both arms and drawing me to her\r\nbosom, covered me with kisses; her eyes became almost perfectly\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you dear, dear, darling boy, I love you beyond expression. Kiss,\r\noh, kiss me! my darling! and comfort me, because I love you all too\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, again, there was a change, she seemed to fear she had said too\r\nmuch, and turned away her head and tears started to her eyes, but her\r\narms did not relax the embrace in which she held me. I was deeply moved\r\nat her evident agitation. I thought she was really ill, and suffering\r\ngreatly; so I threw my arms round her neck, kissing her tenderly, and\r\nweeping myself, tried to comfort her in my inexperienced way, sobbing\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, dear Miss Evelyn, do be comforted, I so dearly love you that\r\nit makes my heart bleed to see you so unhappy. Oh, let me see you smile,\r\nand do try not to cry so. Why are you so unhappy and low spirited? Oh,\r\nthat I could do anything to make you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d And redoubling my\r\nendearments, she again turned her lovely face to me. Again there was the\r\nunnatural fire in her eyes, and a hectic glow flushed her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou darling angel of a boy; it is you that makes me so unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI started back in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make _you_ unhappy! Oh! Miss Evelyn, how can that be, when I adore\r\nthe very ground you stand on, and love (_sobbing_)\xe2\x80\x94love (_sob_)\xe2\x80\x94love you\r\nmore than anything in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seized my head in her two hands, glued her lips to mine, gave me a\r\nlong, long kiss of love; then, pressing me to her bosom\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, say that again, my loved, my darling boy; it is the love I feel for\r\nyou that is breaking my heart, but I can resist it no longer. Will my\r\nCharlie love his Evelyn always as he does now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how could I do otherwise? I have worshipped you from the first\r\nmoment of your arrival, and have had no other idea. What can I do to\r\nprove it\xe2\x80\x94try, oh, try me. I have never breathed a syllable of my love\r\nfor you, even to yourself, let alone other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes, sparkling with passion, were searching the depths of mine, as\r\nif to fathom my thoughts. I, too, began to feel my amorous passions\r\nexcited by her warm embraces and kisses. She held me tight to her body,\r\nand could not help feeling the hard substance that jutted out against\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you, my Charlie, and will trust you with my life\xe2\x80\x94with more,\r\nwith my honour! I can no longer resist my fate. But, oh! Charlie, love\r\nme always, for I run a fearful risk in loving you as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe again drew me to her lips, my hands clasped her neck in a close\r\nembrace. Her hands wandered\xe2\x80\x94pressed upon my throbbing prick. With\r\ntrembling and hasty fingers she unbuttoned, or rather tore open, my\r\ntrousers, and her soft fingers clasped my naked instrument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall die, dear Miss Evelyn; what must I do to make you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy apparent ignorance could not but please her. She sank back on the\r\nlong low chair on which she was seated, apparently accidentally drawing\r\nup her petticoats with her hand in falling back. I threw myself on my\r\nknees, and pushing her petticoats further up disclosed the rich, dark,\r\ncurly beauty of her mount. She covered her burning face with her hand,\r\nwhile, pressing my head forward, I began pressing her beauteous cunt,\r\nsucking it without daring to lick her clitoris. She tried to push me\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no! I must not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I suppose my proceedings fired her passions still more, for she was\r\nquite moist and juicy, and I have no doubt had already had one discharge\r\nwhile embracing me so warmly. She suddenly said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome then, my loved boy, and I will be all in all to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrawing me up\xe2\x80\x94nothing loath\xe2\x80\x94I was soon extended on her belly, with my\r\nstiff-standing cock pressing against her cunt. I had still the prudence\r\nnot to show any knowledge of the act. I sighed deeply\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my loved Miss Evelyn, do help me, I know not what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand glided down between us, she guided my glowing instrument\r\nbetween the longing lips of her delicious cunt. I pushed, and buried the\r\nhead and two inches of its body at the first thrust. The second brought\r\nit against an unexpected obstacle, for it never had struck me that Miss\r\nEvelyn was a virgin. I pushed hard at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charlie, love, be gentle, you are hurting me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKnowing that the best way would be to excite her by short shoves,\r\nwithout at first trying to go further, I did so, and she began to feel\r\nall the raging desires that so formidable a prick as mine must excite,\r\nwhen moving between the soft velvety folds of her tight and juicy quim.\r\nI held myself in, and continued my proceedings until the convulsive\r\nmovements of her loins, and the increased pressure of the folds of her\r\ncunt, showed me that the crisis was approaching, and she was about to\r\nspend. She hugged me close in her arms, and at the moment of spending\r\ninvoluntarily heaved up her bottom. This was the very moment I was with\r\ndifficulty waiting for. I retired a little and plunged forward with\r\nirresistible force. I burst my way through every barrier, up to the very\r\nroots of my prick. The attack was as painful as unexpected. Miss Evelyn\r\ngave a shriek of agony and swooned away. I at once improved the\r\nopportunity, and thrusting in and out with the utmost vigour, broke down\r\nevery obstacle, and enlarged the opening by side movements as much as\r\npossible, while she was insensible to the pain. I then died away myself\r\nin an agony of delight. I lay soaking within the delicious sheath until\r\nher convulsive shudders and short sobs showed that my now fully\r\ndeflowered mistress was recovering her senses. The thought of the\r\nunexpected victory I had won had already begun to make my cock stand\r\nagain, although it was still comparatively soft. I could feel an\r\ninvoluntary pressure on it, as she came to a full consciousness of our\r\nposition. She threw her arms round my neck, gave me a most impassioned\r\nkiss, and then sobbed and cried as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious idiosyncracy of my nature to be most libidinously\r\nexcited by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tears, and although I really suffered to see her in\r\nsuch grief, it stiffened my prick to its utmost dimensions. I tried to\r\ncomfort her with words, but she sobbed, sobbed on. I suddenly thought\r\nthat a renewal of action might bring about a revulsion of feeling, and\r\nbegan vigorous movements. She sighed deeply, but I could tell by the\r\nnervous twitchings of her loins that her passions were being excited.\r\nThey soon decided the contest. She threw her arms round my waist, and\r\npressed me to her, devouring my mouth with her kisses. Nature prompted\r\nher movements, and in a very few minutes we both poured down a plenteous\r\noffering on Venus\xe2\x80\x99s altar. She shook and trembled as she felt the warm\r\ngush within her, and squeezed me with all her might to her bosom. We lay\r\nin a trance for some ten minutes, my charming governess fainting with\r\nlove, and giving my delighted prick the most luscious pressure, which\r\nspeedily fired him to new efforts. Miss Evelyn herself was most\r\namorously excited, and we again dashed on love\xe2\x80\x99s delicious path\xe2\x80\x94to end,\r\nas usual, in the death-like swoon of satiated passion. When we came to\r\nour senses, my loved mistress, embracing me tenderly, and throwing her\r\neyes up to heaven, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear darling boy, you made me suffer horribly at first, but I\r\nhave been in heaven since. Oh, how I love and adore you. But we must\r\nrise, my Charlie, we may be discovered. We have, in fact, run great\r\nrisk, as the door has not been fastened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose, and withdrew my prick from her reeking quim, which seemed by its\r\nclose pressure to let me go with regret. I found it was all bloody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Charles, let me wipe it with my handkerchief, lest it stain your\r\nshirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did so, and folding it up and placing it in her bosom, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep this precious relic as a memorial of the sacrifice I have\r\nmade to you, my loved boy. Ah! Charlie, you cannot yet understand the\r\nvalue of that sacrifice and the risk of ruin I have run for your sake. I\r\nlove you as I never loved anyone before, or can ever love again. My\r\nhonour and happiness are now in your hands, and it is on your discretion\r\nthey rest. Be careful never to exhibit any liberty of conduct towards me\r\nor to mention to anyone what has occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may readily be imagined I gave her every assurance on that head, and\r\ntold her I loved her too dearly, and was too grateful for the extatic\r\nhappiness she had taught me how to enjoy, for any chance of betrayal to\r\ntake place through my indiscretion. She embraced me tenderly, told me to\r\ngo straight to the garden, that she must seek some repose after all that\r\nhad happened, and we should meet again at midday meal.\r\n\r\nI did as desired, full of sweet thoughts at the exquisite delights she\r\nhad afforded me, and already longing for the afternoon school hour to\r\nrenew the enrapturing union of our souls and bodies. Miss Evelyn did not\r\ncome down to her luncheon, but had something sent up to her room.\r\nHowever, she joined me in the schoolroom at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as usual. She\r\nwas very pale, but embraced me tenderly, and was very endearing. Of\r\ncourse, I immediately became excited, and very enterprising, but she\r\ngently repulsed me, and requested that I would leave her quiet that day,\r\nas she felt not only exhausted, but in pain, and would be all the better\r\nfor perfect repose. I begged hard to be allowed some slight favours, if\r\nnot all, but she was inexorable. Finding that I could neither do any\r\nlessons nor be quiet, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must go into the garden, I think the fresh air and a gentle\r\nwalk will do me good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt instantly occurred to me that if I could draw her away to the summer\r\nhouse, I should have a better chance of succeeding in again enjoying her\r\ndelicious embraces. Accordingly, when she went up to her room to put on\r\nher bonnet and shawl, I possessed myself of the key, to be prepared for\r\nmy chance of success.\r\n\r\nWe walked about the flower garden for a time, Miss Evelyn taking my arm,\r\nand most lovingly conversing with me. She walked somewhat stiffly. We\r\nsat down for a rest, shortly she felt the heat of the sun too great, so\r\nI proposed a walk in the shaded shrubbery. I kept prattling on, so as\r\nnot to let her see how far I was leading her away, she appeared\r\nsurprised that we had got so far, when we came in sight of the summer\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie, my dear, I am afraid it will fatigue me too much to walk\r\nall the way back without rest and we have not the key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it is left in the door, I will run and see.\xe2\x80\x9d Off I bounded,\r\nslipped the key in the lock, and ran back to say it was there, she\r\nfollowed me in, and sank on the long backless sofa, which had already\r\nserved me so often. I begged her to extend herself at length. I placed\r\npillows for her head, and drew a chair for myself near her. She did not\r\nappear to have any suspicion of any act on my part, but lay down on her\r\nside. She took my hand in hers, and we began a conversation, very\r\ninteresting, in as much as it was how we should regulate our conduct, so\r\nas not to raise any suspicion of our amorous connection, and also of how\r\nwe should manage to meet from time to time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot now live without the comfort of\r\nyour embraces, but you must remember, in my dependent position,\r\ndiscovery would be my ruin. I rely on your silence and discretion, and\r\nif I am as dear to you as you, my adored Charlie, are to me, I may\r\nsafely trust to you.\xe2\x80\x9d I threw my arms round her neck, and told her I\r\nloved her all too dearly, and longed too much to return to her endearing\r\nand delicious embraces, for her to have any fear of my committing either\r\nher or myself. She fondly embraced and kissed me. I became fired with\r\npassion. My hand wandered, her position only enabled her to make a\r\nfeeble resistance, I reached her beauteously covered mount, she murmured\r\nsupplications to be left alone, and held her thighs close together.\r\n\r\nShe was not aware of my knowledge of the parts, so inserting my finger\r\ninto the upper part of the lips, I reached her clitoris, and began\r\nrubbing in and out, purposely, in an awkward way, but taking care to hit\r\nthe right point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, my Charlie, you must not do that\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I cannot bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time she threw her arm round my neck and drew me to her\r\nlips, which glued themselves to mine. I felt her thighs yield and open.\r\nI immediately improved the occasion, and began frigging her with my\r\nmiddle finger up her quim. Her passions became inflamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome then, my darling boy, to my arms, I cannot resist you longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant I was unbuttoned and had my trousers down, and was between\r\nher legs almost before she had concluded her sentence. The excitement of\r\nmy caresses had moistened her juicy cunt, and the head of my prick\r\nentered without any difficulty. In my ardour I was about to rush on with\r\na vigorous shove, when she implored me to be more gentle, as she still\r\nsmarted from our morning encounter. Moderating my movements, and gently\r\ninsinuating my stiff instrument, I gradually made my way up to its\r\nutmost limits, and hardly occasioned even a grimace of pain. Here I\r\nstopped, leaving it sheathed up to the root, and making it throb from\r\ninstant to instant. Then seeking my loved Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, our lips\r\nand tongues met. Her arms round my waist became tighter in their\r\nembrace. The delicious folds of her luscious juicy quim began to throb\r\nand press on my excited member. Allowing her to become thoroughly\r\nexcited, I waited until she actually quite unexpectedly yielded down her\r\nnature, and spent profusely, to the exquisite pleasure of my saturated\r\norgan. I still held all off, to give her time after the delight of that\r\nspend, which was probably the first of unalloyed extatic pleasure she\r\nenjoyed; for as I was an inactive participator, there was nothing to\r\ncause any action on the still raw edges of her broken maidenhead. Her\r\ninternal pressures were most exquisite. Our embraces with tongues and\r\nlips were like the billing and cooing of doves, and very rapidly brought\r\nher again to a raging point of desire. I then began with slow and gentle\r\nmovements, drawing my prick slowly nearly all the way out, and then as\r\nslowly driving it up to the hilt. Her previous very copious discharge\r\nhad so oiled the delicious folds of her cunt, that no pain was felt,\r\nonly the intense pleasure. At last it became overpowering; her arms were\r\nthrown round my waist, and her legs were involuntary cast over my hips.\r\nNature prompted her to the most delicious movements of her bottom; she\r\nmet my forward thrusts, and responded to them in the most libidinous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, go on, dear Charlie\xe2\x80\x94faster!\xe2\x80\x94faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wanted no spur. Fast and furious grew our movements, until at last,\r\nwith a mutual cry of delight, we sank in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms in the\r\nblissful extasy of the most complete enjoyment. It was several minutes\r\nbefore we regained our senses, and both our organs of generation were\r\npulsating, the one within the other, in all the luxury of satiated\r\npassion. With her beauteous legs still thrown over mine, she moved her\r\narms to my neck, kissed me voluptuously, and mingled the sweetest\r\naccents of gratification with the most endearing caresses and\r\nflatteries. I lay, as it were, in the paphian bower of bliss, in a state\r\nof exquisite sensations quite impossible to describe. It seemed even a\r\ngreater pleasure than the more active state of delight we had been to. I\r\ncould have lain so for hours, but for that excitable prick of mine,\r\nwhose sensibilities were far too rapidly set in motion by the luscious\r\npressures of that most delightful cunt in which it lay engulphed. It had\r\ngradually resumed its pristine firmness, and was now at full stand,\r\nthrobbing impatiently for further combats. I began to move. Miss Evelyn\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Charlie, you must cease, my dear boy; we must not only be\r\nprudent, but consider your youth and health. Do, oh! do! my dear boy.\r\nOh!\xe2\x80\x94pray cease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer words were cut short by the increasing passion that the vigorous\r\nmovements of my prick occasioned to her whole system. She could resist\r\nno longer, but with arms and legs closely embracing me, and devouring me\r\nwith kisses, she threw herself into the fight, and with body and soul so\r\nseconded me that we died away in screams of delight, and sank quite\r\ninsensible in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\nIt was many minutes before we recovered speech. I still lay entirely\r\nembedded in her most exquisite cunt, and would have liked to have\r\ncontinued in her delicious embrace. But Miss Evelyn so imploringly\r\nbeseeched me to cease for this time, and pointed out how necessary\r\nprudency was, if we ever wished to meet again, that I felt compelled to\r\nraise myself from her body. But, in doing so, I slid off downwards, and\r\nbefore she could prevent me, I glued my lips to the open pouters below\r\nme, and greedily devoured all her delicious discharge, and did not\r\ndesist until I had so licked her clitoris as to make her spend most\r\ncopiously again. At first she had tried to resist, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, what on earth are you at? You must not, my dear boy, it is\r\ndreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, as I roused her passions, her hand, instead of trying to draw away\r\nmy head, held it firm and pushed it well against her throbbing and\r\ndelicious quim, her thighs closed against the sides of my head, and she\r\nalmost swooned away with the extasy of her discharge. I greedily\r\nswallowed it and rising completely, took her in my arms, and placing her\r\non her bottom, sweetly kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a charming creature you are, my beloved Miss Evelyn, I adore\r\nyou from the sole of your feet to the crown of your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, my beloved Charlie, have more than justified my imprudence.\r\nYou have given me a joy which I could never have dreamt of. I am yours,\r\nbody and soul; do with me as you like. I, too, adore the very ground you\r\ntread on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe continued exchanging the sweetest vows of affection, until, seeing my\r\nprick rising to its usual stiffness, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling, you must put this away; it would be most imprudent to\r\ncontinue any longer. Now, let me button it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFirst stooping and kissing it, she put it into my trousers with some\r\ndifficulty, buttoned me up, and we strolled towards the house.\r\n\r\nOur conversation turned on our chance of fresh encounters. She begged I\r\nwould not think of attempting anything of the kind next day, and she\r\nwould try and arrange for the day after, although my sisters were\r\nterribly in the way.\r\n\r\nI suggested she should keep me in as when she flogged me, nay, indeed,\r\nshe should flog me in reality if she liked.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at my idea, but said something might be done in that way as\r\na blind. So I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will neglect my lesson on purpose to furnish an excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see\xe2\x80\x94we shall see. Meanwhile, remember to be very prudent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe reached the house; she retired to her room until mamma returned. Very\r\nkind inquiries were made, she said she had suffered severely from\r\nheadache, but, on the whole, felt better and hoped that a good night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrest would put her all to rights. We all retired early, both mamma and\r\nthe girls were tired with their drive and shopping. I had resumed my bed\r\nin the little dressing room, and went to sleep with thoughts of my\r\ndelicious day\xe2\x80\x99s doings, to dream of re-enacting them with every amorous\r\nexcess that the utmost lubricity could suggest.\r\n\r\nThe next day Miss Evelyn began to resume her former looks\xe2\x80\x94the struggle\r\nwas at an end. She was very gentle in her manner, and seemed even more\r\naffectionate than usual to my sisters, who, fancying she was not very\r\nwell, were attentive, rather trying to anticipate her wishes than\r\nfollowing them.\r\n\r\nThere was rather a greater appearance of reserve than previously in her\r\nmanner to me, but when I went up to her to repeat my lessons, there was\r\na warmer clasping of my waist and a suppressed manner that showed she\r\nwas restraining her desire to press me to her bosom. Her face slightly\r\nflushed, and she turned her beautiful eyes upon me with such an\r\nendearing expression of affection that I could have thrown myself into\r\nher arms but for the check upon my ardour which her own reserve imposed\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nNothing more took place between us that day. At our usual hour of\r\nrecreation, from four till five, Miss Evelyn retired to her room to\r\nrepose after the efforts of restraint that she had put upon herself all\r\nday, and left us to ourselves. I need not say an immediate resort to the\r\nsummer house followed. There, first deliciously fucking Mary, and then\r\ngamahuching Eliza, with the addition of gently introducing, at the same\r\ntime, a finger a short distance up her quim, I finished off with another\r\nvoluptuous fuck with Mary. I thus was enabled to bear the bridle Miss\r\nEvelyn put upon the indulgence of my appetite in her person, and was\r\napparently more reasonable than in reality. She again, on the second\r\nday, failed to give me the opportunity I so longed for. Thinking she\r\nmight hesitate, from fear of discovery, and the fact of having no\r\napparently reasonable excuse of being alone with me, I determined to\r\nplay the idler next day in the afternoon. On being called up, I had done\r\nnothing. Miss Evelyn looked grave, but blushed deeply at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Charlie, by this idleness? Go, do your lesson, or I\r\nshall be obliged to punish you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took me by the arm, and gently pressed it as she told me to resume\r\nmy seat. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, of course, my lesson was as far as before from\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary and Eliza, you can go into the garden. Charles will remain until\r\nhe finishes his lesson, or is punished for his idleness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left and Miss Evelyn locked the door after them. Then we flew into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and indulged in the most endearing caresses for a\r\nvery few seconds. I had been in a state of most violent erection for\r\nsome time, so that my hand was up her petticoats immediately. I gently\r\npushed her back on her low long easy chair, and kneeling in front, first\r\nthrust my head between her thighs, and taking a glance at her\r\nbeautifully haired cunt, already all moist and juicy, showing that she\r\nwas as ready as myself, I gamahuched her until she spent in my mouth,\r\nand sucked the delicious liquid most greedily. There was something\r\npeculiarly sweet in her spend, and my tongue sought the innermost lining\r\nof her delicious quim as far as its limited length would admit, that I\r\nmight not lose a drop of her exquisite nectar, worthy of the gods. The\r\nexcitement I occasioned her was almost too much for her to bear, she\r\ndrew me up, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie, my angel of a boy, come, oh, come to my arms.\xe2\x80\x9d I raised\r\nmyself up, threw myself into her arms, and in a moment I was engulphed\r\nup to the cods in her exquisite and throbbing cunt; she closed upon me\r\nwith arms and legs, we were both too violently excited to pause for any\r\nof the more voluptuous movements of less violent desires, but rushed on\r\nin passion\xe2\x80\x99s wildest extasy, both far too eager to think of any\r\nrestraint, and with the utmost vigour on both our parts, we ran our\r\nfirst course with great rapidity. My adored Miss Evelyn had quite got\r\nover every feeling of pain, and could not but be delighted with the heat\r\nand vigour of my attack. We both died away together, at the extatic\r\nmoment pouring down a mutual flood of spunk to cool the inflamed members\r\nthat had the instant before been in such tumultuous action. Darling Miss\r\nEvelyn hugged me close to her bosom, and threw her beautiful eyes,\r\nscreaming with passion, up to the ceiling, as if to thank heaven for the\r\njoys she had felt. Our lips then met and glued themselves together in\r\none long, long kiss of love, which quickly lighted up our lust; she was\r\nas eager as myself, and we had another vigorous encounter, ending in all\r\nthe agonies of delight, as before. Then after a longer interval of the\r\nmost endearing caresses and fond accents of murmured love, we ran our\r\nthird course, with more abandon\xe2\x80\x94lengthening out our exquisite\r\nsensations, by slower and quicker movements and pauses between\xe2\x80\x94in which\r\nmy beautiful governess began to develop an art in which she shortly\r\nbecame even superior to the more experienced Mrs. Benson, who had so\r\ncharmingly initiated me into love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries.\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar charming and endearing softness in the manner of\r\nMiss Evelyn most winning and most exquisitely attractive. It was\r\nevidenced even in her mode of handling my prick; without grasping it,\r\nher hand appeared to pass over it hardly touching it, but in so exciting\r\na manner that after any number of encounters, she could raise it by her\r\nfairy touch in a moment. Our third encounter lasted quite half an hour,\r\nand we sank in the death-like luxury of discharge, our whole souls\r\nseemed to exude with the exquisite distillation of our seed. We had long\r\nbefore regained our senses. I was still engulphed in her delicious cunt,\r\nbut she begged me to relieve her of my weight. We rose, she shook her\r\npetticoats down, and assisted me to arrange my trousers. I then sat down\r\nand took her on my knee. Our lips met in a mutual warm kiss of gratified\r\npassion. She thanked me for the joys of paradise I had given her\xe2\x80\x94and for\r\nmy discretion in procuring an excuse for our meeting. She acknowledged\r\nthat she had been as impatient as myself, but was obliged to take every\r\nprecaution against raising the slightest suspicion in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must always remember, my darling boy, that for me discovery would\r\nbe my ruin for ever. I risk everything to possess you, my beloved boy, I\r\nwould care little for discovery, if it would not also separate us for\r\never. That idea, my adored Charlie, is insupportable, I can no longer\r\nexist without you.\xe2\x80\x9d Here she threw her arms round my neck, and burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nI have already described the effect of tears on my unruly member, which,\r\nwhile I was consoling and vowing eternal attachment to my loved\r\nmistress, burst from its bonds and stood out in all its glory. I took\r\nher soft and beautiful little hand, and laid it on it. She grasped it\r\ntightly, and looking at it, while smiling through her tears, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Charlie, what a great big thing it is. I wonder how it could ever\r\nget into me, without killing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall soon see that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and changing places, I laid her down,\r\nlifted her petticoats and was into her in a moment. She begged me to\r\nproceed slowly, and to lengthen out our pleasures as much as possible.\r\nWe had a most glorious and truly delicious fuck; my lovely and charming\r\nmistress giving me most extatic pleasure by the exquisite pressures of\r\nthe internal folds of her delicious and lascivious cunt.\r\n\r\nWe lay enraptured for long after we had spent, and then resumed our\r\nsitting position, and arranged everything in order, as the time for the\r\nreturn of my sisters from their hour of recreation was close at hand.\r\n\r\nOur conversation naturally turned upon how we should arrange for our\r\nnext meeting. Miss Evelyn insisted that we must not think of meeting\r\nmore than once in three or four days, as otherwise we might raise\r\nsuspicions fatal to our meeting at all. However reasonable this was, I\r\nraised an outcry against such a tantalizing delay, and begged hard for a\r\nshorter period between our intervals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be my darling boy, remember discovery would separate us for\r\never. By prudence, we may long continue these delicious meetings.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsuddenly suggested that as I slept alone in the little room, which, when\r\nthe spare room was unoccupied, was far away from everyone, she might\r\nsteal along at night, when all were asleep, and thus I could enjoy the\r\nwhole of her exquisite charms, without hindrance. She did not reply, but\r\nI could see her eye sparkled, and her cheek flushed as if already in\r\nimagination she was revelling untrammelled in all the luxury of\r\nvoluptuousness such a plan opened out. However, she did not at once\r\naccept, but kissing me fondly, called me her dear and ingenious boy, and\r\nsaid she would think over my suggestion. We resumed our lessons on my\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x99 return. Miss Evelyn was again four days before she gave me\r\nanother opportunity of an amorous meeting. It was only my purposed\r\ninsubordination that obtained me this interview. We again indulged in\r\nall the luxuries of carnal enjoyment, as far as could be done,\r\nincommoded as we both were by dress and locality. Reverting more\r\nstrongly than ever to my plan of meeting in my lonely room, I begged so\r\nhard that at last she promised to come the night of the following day. I\r\nwas obliged to put up with this, although I would fain have had her come\r\nthat very night, but as her passions were evidently gaining stronger\r\npossession of her, and she was becoming more loving, and more voluptuous\r\nthan ever, I felt certain she would not disappoint me on the next night.\r\nThe delicious idea of revelling in charms I had so often furtively gazed\r\non, kept me away from my sisters next day. Under a plea of headache I\r\nwent early to bed, and took up some oil, to oil the hinges and lock of\r\nthe door, to be prepared for my loved mistress. I lay long awake, and\r\nwas almost in despair of her coming, when I heard the clock strike\r\ntwelve. All at once I became aware she was at my bedside. She had\r\nentered the room with so gentle a step that though on the watch for her,\r\nI did not hear her even when she opened the door, shut, and locked it.\r\nShe had come in her dark-grey cloak, and when at my bedside this was\r\ndropped on the floor, she stood in nothing but a very fine and thin\r\nchemise. She flung herself in my arms, as I rose to embrace her, and we\r\ninstantly sank closely clasped in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. I was far too\r\nsharply set to practise any preliminaries. I turned her on her back, and\r\nwas into her in a moment, with one vigorous thrust, which almost took\r\naway her breath, and gave her intense delight. I was too quick for her,\r\nhowever, as I spent in two or three shoves into that delight-giving\r\ncunt. But as this hardly allayed the fires of my too ardent desires, the\r\nconvulsive internal movements of her unsatisfied orbit quickly restored\r\nmy scarcely reduced member to a renewed vigour. Miss Evelyn being\r\ngreatly excited by the unsatisfying nature of my first bout, was\r\nextremely warm, and throwing her arms and legs around my body, we again\r\nrushed headlong into all the fury of fucking, and as my previous\r\nspendings had somewhat reduced the power of immediate discharge, I was\r\nable to suit my movements exactly to those of my most active companion,\r\nand we sank together in all the voluptuousness of satisfied desires,\r\nlying long locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, before we were again in a state\r\nto renew our combats in love\xe2\x80\x99s delicious domain. We spent the interval\r\nin whispered vows and fond endearments and embracings of each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnaked charms, both of us admiringly passing our hands over every part of\r\nour bodies.\r\n\r\nMiss Evelyn at last concentrated all her attention on my well-developed\r\nmember, which she most endearingly embraced and fondled tenderly, very\r\nquickly putting him into an ungovernable state of erection. I was lying\r\non my back, and she partially raised herself to kiss my formidable\r\nweapon; so gently putting her upon me, I told her it was her turn to do\r\nthe work. She laughed, but at once mounted upon me, and bringing her\r\ndelicious cunt right over my prick, and guiding it to the entrance of\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s grotto, she gently sank down upon it and engulphed it until the\r\ntwo hairs pressed against each other. A few slow up and down movements\r\nfollowed, when becoming too libidinous for such temporizing delays, she\r\nsank on my belly, and began to show most wonderful activity of loins and\r\nbottom. I seconded her to the utmost, and finding she was so excited, I\r\nslipped my hand round behind and introduced my middle finger in the rosy\r\nand very tight orifice of her glorious backside. I continued to move in\r\nand out in unison with her up and down heavings. It seemed to spur her\r\non to more vigorous actions, and in the midst of short gaspings and\r\nsuppressed sighs, she sank almost senseless on my bosom. I, too, had\r\nquickened my action, and shot into her gaping womb a torrent of boiling\r\nsperm.\r\n\r\nWe lay entranced in the raptures of satiated desire for a long time. At\r\nlast she came to her senses, and fondly kissing me, turned off, and we\r\nlay side by side closely embraced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my beloved Charlie, what exquisite delight you have given me; you\r\nare the most delicious and loving creature that ever could be created.\r\nYou kill me with pleasure, but what was that you were doing to my\r\nbottom? What put such an idea into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI put my arm round to feel the beautiful\r\nglobes of your bottom, and found in grasping one that my finger was\r\nagainst a hole, all wet with our previous encounters, and pressing it,\r\nfound that my finger slipped in; you gave it such a delicious pressure\r\nwhen in that the idea entered into my head that, as it resembled the\r\ndelicious pressure your enchanting other orifice gives my shaft when\r\nembracing you, this orifice would like a similar movement to that which\r\nmy shaft exercised in your quim. So I did so, and it seemed to add to\r\nyour excitement, if I may judge by the extraordinary convulsive\r\npressures you gave my finger when you died away in all the agony of our\r\nfinal rapture. Tell me, my beloved Miss Evelyn, did it add to your\r\npleasure as much as I fancied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my darling Charlie, I must own it did, very much to my surprise;\r\nit seemed to make the final pleasure almost too exciting to bear, and I\r\ncan only account it a happy accident leading to an increase to pleasure\r\nI already thought beyond the power of nature to surpass. Naughty boy, I\r\nfeel your great instrument at full stretch again, but you must moderate\r\nyourself, my darling, we have done enough for tonight. No, no, no! I am\r\nnot going to let him in again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPassing her hand down, she turned away its head from the charming\r\nentrance of her cunt, and began handling and feeling it in apparent\r\nadmiration of its length, thickness, and stiffness. Her gentle touch did\r\nanything but allay the passion that was rising to fever heat; so sucking\r\none of her bubbies, while I pressed her to me with one arm under her,\r\nand embracing her on the other side, I passed my hand between our moist\r\nand warm bodies, reached her charming clitoris, already stiff with the\r\nexcitement of handling my prick. My titillations soon decided her\r\npassions, and gently prompting her with the arm under her body, I turned\r\nher once more on the top of me. She murmured an objection, but offered\r\nno resistance; on the contrary, she herself guided my throbbing and\r\neager prick into the voluptuous sheath that was longing to engulph it.\r\nOur movements this time were less hurried and more voluptuous. For some\r\ntime she kept her body upright, rising and falling from her knees. I put\r\nmy finger to her clitoris, and added to the extatic pleasure she was so\r\nsalaciously enjoying. She soon found she must come to more rapid and\r\nvigorous movements, and lying down on my belly embraced and kissed me.\r\nToying with our tongues I put an arm round her waist, and held her\r\ntight, while her glorious buttocks and most supple loins kept up the\r\nmost delicious thrust and pressures on my thoroughly engulphed weapon. I\r\nagain stimulated her to the highest pitch of excited desires by\r\nintroducing my finger behind, and we both came to the grand crisis in a\r\ntumultuous state of enraptured agony, unable to do ought, but from\r\nmoment to moment convulsively throb in and on our engulphed members. We\r\nmust have lain thus languidly, and deliciously enjoying all the raptures\r\nof the most complete and voluptuous gratification of our passions, for\r\nfully thirty minutes before we recovered complete consciousness. Miss\r\nEvelyn was first to remember where she was. She sprang up, embraced me\r\ntenderly, and said she must leave me at once, she was afraid she had\r\nalready stayed imprudently long. In fact, it was near five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe morning. I rose from the bed to fling my arms round her lovely body,\r\nto fondle and embrace her exquisite bubbies. With difficulty she tore\r\nherself from my arms. I accompanied her to the door, and with a mutual\r\nand loving kiss we parted. I to return and rapidly sink into the\r\nsweetest slumber after such a delicious night of most voluptuous\r\nfucking.\r\n\r\nShe came again three times in the next six nights; each time we renewed\r\nour mutual joys, with ever increasing voluptuous indulgencies. On coming\r\nto me for the fifth time, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Charlie, I have only come to kiss you, and say I cannot stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCannot stop!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand why not, beloved Miss Evelyn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not well, but cannot explain more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had sprung out of bed, and clasped her in my arms, then passing a hand\r\ndown to her beauteous and well-covered mons Veneris, I found that she\r\nwas tied up there in cloth. I immediately remembered how my loved Mrs.\r\nBenson had been exactly in the same way. I then also remarked the\r\npeculiar odour of breath, but pretending ignorance, I begged to know\r\nwhat had happened to my darling little grotto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you more, my dear boy, but it will keep me away from you\r\nfor four or five nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should that be the case; cannot you let me enter that delicious\r\ncave of delight only once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, impossible! my dear Charlie, absolutely impossible! It would do\r\nme very great harm, and you too. Let us be quiet in that way, and I\r\nshall be the sooner well again to come and embrace you as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but darling, how can I support five nights\xe2\x80\x99 absence, I shall go mad\r\nwith desire and burst\xe2\x80\x94feel how he grows, and is longing for his loved\r\ncompanion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer soft and gentle hand caressed it. I thought to succeed by a _coup de\r\nmain_, but she was too quick for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Charles, I am serious, and you must not try to force me, or I shall\r\nnever come near you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw she was in earnest, and flung myself on the bed in a pet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my darling Charlie, be reasonable, and I will do my best to give\r\nyou some satisfaction. Lay yourself on your back\xe2\x80\x94so. I will kneel on the\r\nfloor at right angles to you, because you must not attempt to touch me\r\ndown there. That is a dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo taking my prick in her soft hand, she gently moved it up and down;\r\nthen, suddenly stopping, took it into her mouth, sucking as much as she\r\ncould get in, and titillating the knob with her tongue, while one hand\r\nfrigged at the root of my prick and the other gently handled my two\r\ncrisped-up cods. She prolonged the pleasure by occasional pauses, and at\r\nlast, on finding the electric-like sensations coming, she hastened her\r\nmovement, and I poured a torrent of sperm into her mouth. She continued\r\nher delicious sucking until not a drop more was left for her to swallow.\r\nThis was the first time she ever gamahuched me, but it was not the last\r\nby scores of times. Ever after we improved upon the model, and added\r\nother endearments. When not under her courses, we mutually gamahuched\r\neach other, and she was the first to repeat upon me, with the intensest\r\ngratification, the delicious introduction of a finger behind while\r\ngamahuching me. At present, when she had thus taken the edge off my\r\ncarnal appetite, she lovingly embraced me, and left me to my lovely\r\nslumbers. Of course, the four days\xe2\x80\x99 grace, saving two more passing\r\nvisits \xe2\x80\x9cto keep me cool,\xe2\x80\x9d as she said, turned all to the advantage of my\r\nsisters, whom I fucked and frigged to their utmost gratification and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nI thus passed about four months. Miss Evelyn becoming a perfect adept in\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s delicious mysteries; but, although I had attempted to enjoy the\r\norifice of the lower temple of Venus, my member was too large, and gave\r\ntoo much pain, to completely succeed, so that I became the faithful\r\nworshipper at the more legitimate altar of love. My sisters were\r\ngradually developing their forms. Mary particularly so. The hair on her\r\nquim had increased to a most charming curling profusion. Her hips spread\r\nout, and her bottom, hard and prominent, promised to be very large.\r\nEliza, too, began to show increased bubbies, and an enlarged and mossy\r\nmons Veneris.\r\n\r\nWe were approaching summer, and near the full of the moon, Mary had\r\ncomplained of feeling very low spirited, and very much inclined to cry.\r\nI tried to comfort her, and thought success would best attend my efforts\r\nif I fucked her. So enticing her down into the garden, we entered the\r\nsummer house, and I at once proceeded to action. She was rather\r\nunwilling, she could not say why, but had an instinctive reluctance. She\r\nyielded, however, to my entreaties, and I fucked her without apparently\r\nexciting her in the usual way. I consequently withdrew as soon as I had\r\nrun the first course, and at once discovered what ailed poor Mary. My\r\nmember was covered with blood. For the first time her courses had come\r\nupon her. She was greatly alarmed, but I told her I had heard it was\r\nquite natural to young women when they reached a certain age, that she\r\nhad better tell mamma at once, who would instruct her what to do. I\r\ncarefully wiped my reddened member, and then retired to my room to\r\npurify myself. That very night, on Miss Evelyn coming to me, I found she\r\nwas exactly in the same state. She gave me my usual relief with her soft\r\nhand and caressing lips, and then left me for five nights, as at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI now found myself reduced to my dear little sister Eliza. Up to this\r\ntime I had never actually fucked her, and her maidenhead was still\r\nintact. She was now approaching fourteen, and the down on her charming\r\nlittle cunt was becoming more decided; her bubbies too, under the erotic\r\nexcitement of my _attouchements_ and gamahuching, had assumed a decided\r\nprominence. My finger had somewhat rendered the opening of her little\r\npinky slit more easy of access. So I resolved to complete her carnal\r\neducation and fuck her thoroughly. The opportunity was perfect; both\r\nMiss Evelyn and Mary retired to their rooms to lie down at our usual\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s recreation, Eliza and I at once hied to the summer house, and\r\nlocked ourselves in. I immediately laid her down on the long couch, and\r\ngamahuched her until she spent in my mouth, and then continued until she\r\nwas again almost mad with desire. I then told her I should initiate her\r\ninto a new mystery, more delicious than any she had yet experienced, but\r\nthat the first initiation was always painful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what is it, my dear Charlie, everything you do is so nice, I know I\r\nshall like it\xe2\x80\x94what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must know, dear Eliza, that this little cunt of yours is made\r\nfor the express purpose of having a prick put into it; only, as mine is\r\nso large, and you are still so small and so young, I was afraid it would\r\ngive you too much pain to do it sooner; but now, I think, I may get it\r\nin, if I do it gently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charlie, dear, put it in at once, I have often felt I should like\r\nit so; but, as you never attempted to do it, I thought it was a mere\r\nfancy of mine. Have you ever put it inside Mary\xe2\x80\x99s quim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften; nay, always, my darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe adores it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen put it into me directly, Charlie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wanted nothing better, and told her that in order to thoroughly enjoy\r\nit, she must strip. In a minute she dropped off everything, while I took\r\noff my trousers\xe2\x80\x94coat and waistcoat having been already laid aside. I had\r\nbrought a towel to lay on the couch below her bottom, to prevent any\r\ntell-tale stains. Laying her down on her back, with her bottom close to\r\nthe end, her legs gathered up, and her two feet resting on the sofa,\r\nwith her knees falling outwards (in the very best position for my\r\nintended operation), I put a pillow on the floor, on which I knelt, thus\r\nbringing my cock a little above her quim to give me a good purchase. I\r\nthen first gamahuched her well again, until she spent and cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, put it in, my dear Charlie, I do feel to want it so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was already well moistened by her previous discharges, and by my\r\nlicking the lips of her cunt, and covering them with saliva, with which\r\nI also, at the same time, wetted my prick itself. I then made the point\r\napproach the charming pouting and longing lips of her sweet little cunt,\r\nand rubbing it first up and down between the lips, proceeded to insert\r\nits knob between them. Thanks to the precautions taken, and the\r\nexcitement I had raised by my previous caresses with tongue and prick,\r\nthe immediate entrance was effected with greater ease than might have\r\nbeen expected. No sooner was it in about an inch beyond the knob than\r\nthe passion of excitement I had raised so stimulated the natural\r\nlubricity of Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s nature that she heaved up her buttocks\r\nenergetically, letting her knees drop quite down sideways, thus\r\nfavouring to the utmost my forward thrust made at the moment, so that my\r\nprick was sheathed in an instant more than half his length, and but for\r\nthe obstacle of her maidenhead, which he then met with, would have been\r\nentirely engulphed. As it was, it gave her a very sharp pang of pain,\r\nwhich made her shrink back, and utter an\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not fear, I will be gentle, keep still a moment and then you will\r\nfind the pain pass away, and great pleasure follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we lay still for a time, until I felt those involuntary internal\r\npressures, the true precursors and infallible indicators of rising\r\ndesires; so commencing a slow and continuous in and out movement, I\r\nshortly produced such an excess of pleasure in her delicious orbit, that\r\nher movements became almost furious, and nature alone prompted her to\r\nsecond me with as much art as if she had already been long instructed in\r\nthe delicious movements so calculated to add to the libidinous delights\r\nof true enjoyment.\r\n\r\nBut Eliza was a rare example of a truly salacious and voluptuous nature,\r\nand proved herself in that way far in advance of Mary; although she was\r\nof a very warm temperament, Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s passions were far more excitable,\r\nand in the end she became one of the most voluptuous fuckers possible,\r\nabandoning herself to all the wildest raptures that the most erotic\r\nnature could suggest. Of this, hereafter; at present I had worked her up\r\nto the utmost pitch of excited desire; she was in the very act of\r\ndischarging, and as I withdrew for a final thrust, she heaved up her\r\nbuttocks in an agony of pleasure, I felt it was now or never, and\r\nstriking home with all my force, I burst with irresistible strength\r\nthrough every obstacle, and tore my way inwards, until sheathed to my\r\nvery cods. Poor Eliza! at the very moment she thought herself in the\r\nseventh heaven of delight, she experienced the most excruciating agony.\r\nShe gave a piercing cry and fainted away; her arms fell senseless from\r\nmy body\xe2\x80\x94her legs would have also fallen, but twining my arms round them,\r\nI continued for several successive thrusts to penetrate fully and easily\r\ninto every recess, for I myself was wound up to a fearful state of\r\nexcitement. I died away in an excess of joy, sending a torrent of balmy\r\nsperm to soften and mitigate the pain of her terribly torn quim. Finding\r\nthat Eliza could not regain consciousness, I rose somewhat in alarm, and\r\nwas horrified to see the quantity of blood that followed my withdrawal.\r\nIt was fortunate my forethought of the towel, as it had not only saved\r\nthe sofa, but helped to stanch her swollen and bleeding quim, and to\r\nwipe the blood from her thighs and bottom. I had effected all this\r\nbefore the dear girl showed the least symptoms of animation. She first\r\nsighed, then shivered, and at last opened her eyes, and looked\r\nconfusedly at me, and asked\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to me, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen observing how she was lying naked, she recovered her complete\r\nconsciousness of all the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie, now I know; I thought you had killed me; Charlie, oh! it\r\nwas so frightfully painful. How could you hurt me so, and just as I\r\nthought it was the most heavenly pleasure I had ever experienced in all\r\nmy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, it is all over now, and it will never hurt again, and we\r\nshall both of us have greater pleasure than ever, but not just now; it\r\nhas been greater pain to you than I thought it would be, and for the\r\npresent we must not attempt any more.\xe2\x80\x9d I helped her to rise, but she\r\nfelt very faint, and I had great difficulty in getting her dressed. She\r\nwas shocked to see the bloody state of the towel. I told her to put my\r\nhandkerchief between her thighs, and partly up her slit, to prevent any\r\nmarks of blood staining her shift. I then laid her down on the sofa,\r\nwhile I ran to get some water from the fountain in the garden. I took a\r\nglass and the towel with me. I returned with the water, which greatly\r\nrefreshed Eliza. I begged her to lie still as long as she could stay.\r\nHowever, when she attempted to walk, she found herself very much\r\nincommoded with the smarting pain. I was terribly afraid lest this would\r\nbe observed when we got to the house, so I suggested she should\r\npurposely fall down when in sight of anyone, and say she could not move\r\nbecause she had hurt her knee by the fall.\r\n\r\nThis stratagem succeeded admirably. We were seen approaching by Miss\r\nEvelyn, my mother, and Mary. Dear Eliza acted her part admirably, was\r\nseen to fall heavily, and screamed. They all rushed out, we lifted her\r\ncarefully on her legs, and supported her to the house, she complaining\r\nof the pain in the knee and ankle. My mother insisted on her going to\r\nbed at once, and having embrocations and hot towels applied. Eliza let\r\nthem do as they liked, and eventually was left to quiet repose, which\r\nsoon relieved the painful sensations she had undergone. Next day she\r\ncomplained of great stiffness, and walked lame, but thought the hot\r\napplications had prevented the swelling, so thus happily passed off all\r\nobservations of suspicion of the real circumstances of the case. It was\r\nnot until the third day after that I attempted to make an entrance. Of\r\ncourse, I excited her first to the utmost by a long continued\r\ngamahuching. She then let me, but with fear and trembling, introduce my\r\nbursting member into the delicate folds of her cunt. As I was very\r\ngentle in my movements, the pain was scarcely felt, and when once well\r\nsheathed, and the first thrusts given slowly and luxuriously, the whole\r\nlubricity of her nature was soon awakened, and by the time I was ready\r\nto spend she was as ready to second me, and we died away in a mutual\r\nflood of delighted extasy. She held me close, and would not let me\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Charlie, it took some trouble to get it in, let it stop where it is\r\nso deliciously engulphed,\xe2\x80\x9d and at once anticipating her natural desires,\r\nshe began the most exquisite pressures upon me, which very shortly\r\nbrought us both up to the point of demanding more active measures.\r\nHowever, I rather restrained her, and told her we must retard our\r\nmovements to increase our pleasures, because mere quick repetitions\r\nwould only exhaust her, without yielding the true extasies of enjoyment.\r\nI, therefore, taught her the pleasures of the slow movements, and I\r\nworked her up to spending point, without giving way myself. The dear\r\nlittle creature clung to me with the most close and endearing embraces,\r\nas if she should force a complete amalgamation of our two bodies, and\r\ndied away in the sweetest bliss of contented desire, with such a\r\nheavenly expression of extasy on her face as made me devour it with\r\nkisses. I had great difficulty in restraining myself from precipitately\r\nfollowing her example; her delicious movements at the moment of\r\nspending, and the close pressures on my prick, were so exciting that\r\nresisting them was quite a triumph of control. I succeeded, and lay\r\nquite quiet, embalmed in the delicious suction of those exquisite folds\r\nof her charming little cunt, which exercised the most delightful\r\npressures as well as suction on my enraptured prick. I left it entirely\r\nto her to lie as we were as long as she pleased, or to again begin the\r\ndear delightful friction that should once more make us dash on passion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfurious course, to end as usual in the ever delicious extasies of the\r\nfinal crisis.\r\n\r\nThis last bout had been a double one for my sister; she all but swooned\r\naway with the rapture my spending in unison with her produced. She\r\ndeclared it was a death of the most delicious extasy, which it was\r\nperfectly impossible to describe. She clung to me, kissing me in the\r\nmost endearing manner, and telling me how happy I had at last made her\r\nby completing the insertion of my prick in her cunt. It was worth the\r\nsuffering of twenty times as much agony to arrive at so exquisite a\r\nresult as every fuck I now gave her conferred upon her. We adjourned to\r\nthe flower garden, that we might be seen playing together, and not\r\nexcite suspicion by our constant disappearance, now that we were only\r\ntwo together. Of course, Mary knew what we were at and probably guessed\r\nthat I had completed the initiation of Eliza. She smiled, and gave me a\r\nsignificant pressure of the hand, when we met again in the schoolroom to\r\nresume our lessons. For two days more I enjoyed Eliza all to myself; at\r\neach new fuck she became more and more perfect in conferring as well as\r\nreceiving pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, Miss Evelyn whispered, \xe2\x80\x9ctonight,\xe2\x80\x9d as she gave me a\r\nstolen pressure of the hand. She came, and we indulged in every whim of\r\nour fancy. I had further the delicious pleasure of gazing on all her\r\nnaked beauties, as it was daylight before we parted; I had gamahuched\r\nher twice, and fucked her five times. She gave me credit for a long\r\nfast, and allowed so much indulgence on that account, but told me I must\r\nin future be more moderate, for her sake, if not for my own. She allowed\r\nthree nights to pass before again coming to me. I cannot say I regretted\r\nit, because now that Eliza was initiated, as well as Mary, we indulged\r\nin the most delightful orgies of fucking and gamahuching at the same\r\ntime. At first we used to fuck with one laid on her back to be fucked,\r\nwhile the other backed on her knees over the face of the one being\r\nfucked, and was gamahuched by her, while I introduced my finger into the\r\nrosy orifice of the bottom before me. But we found the most voluptuous\r\nway was for one to lie down on her back, and the other on hands and\r\nknees over her. She thus brought her mouth over the cunt of the one\r\nlying down, and presented her bottom to me, who knelt behind her. The\r\none below guided my prick into the cunt above her face; she had thus all\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing our action, while with one hand she tickled\r\nmy cods, and the other felt my bottom-hole, and inserted a finger.\r\nMeanwhile, she was gamahuched and bottom-frigged at the same time by the\r\none I was fucking, and we used all three to die away in agonies of\r\nenraptured delight, to recommence with a change of places between the\r\ntwo girls. Sometimes I tried to introduce my prick into the rosy little\r\norifice of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s backside, but, although the finger-frigging gave her\r\nmuch additional pleasure while her cunt was operated upon by my virile\r\nmember, she as yet could not support the insertion of my large prick. I\r\nhad not even attempted little Lizzie, but one day, when Miss Evelyn and\r\nMary were again under menstruation, and I had dear Lizzie all to myself,\r\nshe was seized with such an irresistible desire to ease herself, that\r\nshe had only time to get behind a bush and squat down. I remained\r\nwaiting for her, when she called to me, to ask if I had any paper. I\r\nadvanced to give her some. She was in a half-standing position, with her\r\nclothes held up to her waist. While giving her the paper, my eyes\r\naccidentally fell upon what she had voided. I was struck with its\r\nextraordinary thickness. I made no observation at the time, but it\r\nraised an idea that preoccupied me much. I had often thought over the\r\npleasure that fucking Mrs. Benson\xe2\x80\x99s bum-hole had given me, hence I had\r\ntried to initiate both Miss Evelyn and Mary in that delightful route of\r\npleasure, but, as before stated, had been unable to succeed with them\r\nfrom the great developement of my weapon. Thinking that if they could\r\nnot bear the insertion, there could be no possibility of success with my\r\nyounger and less developed sister, I had never attempted with Lizzie\r\nmore than the insertion of one finger. It is true, with her it seemed to\r\nproduce more excitement than either upon Miss Evelyn or Mary. The sight\r\nof the extraordinary dimensions of the matter she had voided now\r\nsuggested the idea that if her apparently very small and rosy-lipped\r\nbottom-hole could allow so large a mass to come out, with gentle efforts\r\nmy scarcely larger machine might be inserted. I determined to try the\r\ninitiation into that route of delight the very next day. Remembering\r\nthat dear Mrs. Benson always made it a rule that she should be first\r\nwell fucked and gamahuched, and the prick well moistened, I began by\r\nexciting dear Lizzie to the utmost. I first fucked her, and made her\r\nspend twice to my once; then gamahuched her until she implored me to\r\nshove my prick into her. I had managed to introduce my two forefingers\r\nat once into her bottom, and had frigged her while sucking her cunt,\r\nwithout apparently giving any pain; on the contrary, from her movements\r\nI fancied she felt greater excitement. I took care to enlarge, as much\r\nas possible, or rather to stretch her bottom-hole as open as I could\r\nwith two fingers. It was at the moment of her greatest excitement, when\r\nshe was pressing me to fuck her at once, that I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest sister, there is still another mystery of sensual\r\nvoluptuousness that you have as yet not experienced or been initiated\r\ninto, and I am about to instruct you in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what is it? dear Charlie; but do anything you like, and as quick as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then dear, it is this sweet little orifice in your bottom that I\r\nam going to introduce my prick into. It may give you some little pain\r\nthe first time, but by gentleness of movement, and halting from time to\r\ntime when it hurts too much, we shall get him completely inserted, and\r\nthen it will be an immense pleasure to both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear Charlie, do as you like, your darling prick can only give me\r\nthe greatest delight; I am dying to have him into me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwhere, as long as I get the dear creature into me. I suppose I must be\r\non my hands and knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon which she turned with great agility, and presented the two hard and\r\nalready promising globes of her charming backside. I lost no time in\r\nfirst thrusting my prick up to the hilt in her cunt, to moisten it. It\r\nmade her shudder again with excess of lust, and she exercised such a\r\npressure upon it that I had some difficulty in withdrawing it. It was so\r\nsnug and nice therein that was a great temptation to run a course in her\r\ncunt at once, but having the other object in view, and knowing that I\r\nwanted all its stiffness to succeed, I did summon up courage enough to\r\nwithdraw; then applying the very plenteous saliva in my mouth that\r\ngamahuching her had stimulated, I added it to the already moistened\r\nprick, and applying some to her bum-hole, and introducing a well-wetted\r\nfinger, I put the knob of my formidable prick to the small and smiling\r\norifice that lay before me. The disproportion struck me as so great that\r\nI dreaded success would be much too painful for her, but remembering the\r\ndimensions of what had come out of it, I boldly proceeded with the\r\noperation. I got in over the knob without making her flinch, but, as I\r\nproceded to push gently forward, and had got in about two inches, she\r\ncried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a little, Charlie, it feels so queer\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it in further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped where I was, but slipping a hand under her, I applied my\r\nfinger to her clitoris, holding her bottom tight against me with the\r\nother hand round her waist, so as not to lose ground. My agile finger\r\nsoon worked her passions up, and I felt her bottom give convulsive\r\ntwitches on my prick. I allowed her to become still more excited, and\r\nthen gently pushing forward found I was slowly, and almost\r\nimperceptibly, gaining ground. My prick was then inserted almost\r\ntwo-thirds of its length, when, thrusting rather too sharply, she again\r\ncried out, and, but for the arm that held her fast round the waist,\r\nwould have unseated me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charlie, dear, do stop; it seems to choke me, and makes me feel so\r\nqueer, that I thought I was going to faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall lie quite still, now dear Lizzie. It is quite in\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was a\r\nlittle bit of deception to calm her fears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand when the pain of\r\ninsertion passes, which will be the case in a minute, we shall have\r\nnothing but pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I kept my prick just where he was, but redoubled my frigging her\r\nclitoris, and very soon brought her up to spending point, resolved that\r\nI would not attempt complete insertion until I felt she was in the\r\nraptures of sensual discharge. This quickly came upon her, and it was\r\nthe delicious movement of her own buttocks that sheathed my prick to the\r\nhilt without an effort on my part, and so far from giving her pain, made\r\nher positively scream with the intense voluptuousness of her sensation\r\nin spending. She could not speak for many minutes, but continued the\r\nexquisite pressures of the sphincter muscle on my enraptured prick. But\r\nfor my determination not to give way, and rather to wait for another\r\nbout that would completely initiate dear Lizzie in all the luxury and\r\nabandon of this delicious mode, I must have at once vigorously finished\r\nmy own course. My restraint was well rewarded. The first words my\r\nbeloved sister uttered were those of almost delirious joy at the\r\nextraordinary delight I had given her. Never, never, had any fuck so\r\nenraptured her. She turned up her lovely face to me, and tears of\r\nsensuality and voluptuousness filled her eyes.\r\n\r\nI had hardly begun my titillations on her still excited clitoris, which,\r\nby the way, had lately considerably developed itself, when she was as\r\neager for another bout as I was. I held sufficient restraint on myself\r\nto practice every salacious movement, that I might give Lizzie such\r\nexquisite pleasure as should induce her on future occasions to grant me\r\nthe use of her charming bottom-hole whenever I should desire. I worked\r\nher up to the utmost pitch of the most salacious excitement, and at the\r\nmoment when she spent, in an agony of shrieking extasy, I poured a\r\nperfect flood of spunk right up into her entrails, and we both sank\r\nforward, but without unseating me, quite overpowered by the intensity of\r\nour delight. When we came to our senses I rose from off her. On\r\nwithdrawing my prick I found a few traces of blood, but of no moment. I\r\nwiped my prick on a handkerchief, and also wiped between the cheeks of\r\ndear Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, for fear any tell-tale marks should be made on her\r\nlinen. I then helped her up, and she threw her arms round my neck, and\r\nsweetly kissing me, thanked me for a new lesson in love, which had\r\noverwhelmed her with delight.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first lesson that Lizzie ever received by that route of\r\npleasure, and I may incidentally state that she was peculiarly\r\nconstituted for giving and receiving the most exquisite pleasure in that\r\nway. She afterwards developed into a magnificent woman, with one of the\r\nnaturally largest and finest backsides I almost ever met with; and she\r\ncame to love backward fucking to the utmost extent. In after-days, when\r\nmarried, she told me that her husband was a muff, who had no idea of\r\nenjoying a woman but in one way. She had often deceived him, and slipped\r\nit into her bottom-hole without his ever having any suspicion of the\r\nsort of pleasure he had given her.\r\n\r\nThree months passed with the rapidity of a dream, while we indulged in\r\nthese scenes of delicious lubricity and voluptuousness, without ever\r\nattracting any observation within the house and, more curious, without\r\nMiss Evelyn either discovering or suspecting anything between my sisters\r\nand myself\xe2\x80\x94thanks to my natural powers and the unfailing resources of\r\nyouth. Both she and my sisters thought they each gave me as much as I\r\ncould get through, and, therefore, neither ever imagined I could seek\r\ncarnal delights in other arms. So it was but now there happened one or\r\ntwo events which had a considerable effect on the after-tenour of our\r\nloves.\r\n\r\nA neighbour, a very nice good-looking man, about thirty-five years of\r\nage, a gentleman farmer, very well off, had for some time past always\r\nwaited for us at the church door on Sundays, apparently for a chat with\r\nmamma, Miss Evelyn, and us. He treated and evidently considered us as\r\nmere children, nor did he appear to fix particular attention to anyone.\r\n\r\nOne Monday my mother received a note from him, to beg she would grant\r\nhim a short interview on the following day, as he wished for her advice\r\non a subject of much interest to him. Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s reply begged him to come\r\nat eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when she would be happy to see him.\r\n\r\nHe came, and was particularly neatly dressed. My mother had been very\r\nagitated all the morning, and looked flushed and nervous as the hour\r\ndrew near; I really believe the old lady fancied it was for an idle\r\navowal to herself that he was coming. Be that however as it may, the\r\nobject of his visit turned out to be a proposal to Miss Evelyn, with an\r\noffer of marriage. He was ready to make such settlements upon her as\r\ncould not but be satisfactory. He told my mother that before speaking to\r\nMiss Evelyn, whom he had loved from her first appearance in the parish,\r\nand whose quiet, modest character had daily made a deeper impression, he\r\nthought it only his duty to first break the subject to her, and to ask\r\nher permission for an interview with Miss Evelyn, and next, if he was\r\nacceptable to her, for leave to visit at our house, while courting his\r\nwished-for wife. He further stated that he had never ventured to hint\r\nthe state of his feelings to Miss Evelyn, and prayed my mother to be the\r\nkind intermediary in opening the subject to her, and to beg as a favour\r\nthat she would grant him an interview to state his case in person on the\r\nfollowing day, so that he might learn his fate from her own lips. My\r\nmother, although probably inwardly a little disappointed, had the\r\ninterest of Miss Evelyn too much at heart not to take up the matter\r\nwarmly, and urged, with all the volubility elderly ladies can so well\r\nexercise, whenever the marriage of a younger friend is in question, all\r\nthe benefit that would accrue to her from so advantageous a proposal.\r\nMiss Evelyn was really taken quite by surprise, and stammered out some\r\nvague expressions of wishing for time to consider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense, my dear, remember your dependent position, and the\r\nadvantages this match holds out to you. You must not think or talk of\r\ndelay. He will be here tomorrow, and I hope his lover eloquence will\r\nsoon decide the question in his favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Evelyn burst into tears and said it was so sudden, and she was\r\nso ill-prepared to take any decision. She would, however, think over it\r\nvery seriously and in the morning be better able to give an answer. My\r\nmother seeing that she was much agitated by what she had told her, very\r\nkindly said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive the children a holiday this afternoon, and I advise you to keep\r\nyour own room, and write to your widowed mother, to tell her of the\r\noffer, and to ask her advice how you should act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe thus had many hours to ourselves; I had heard all that had passed,\r\nand felt a sad pressure at my heart, when I began to realise the fact\r\nthat the proposal of Mr. Vincent would, if accepted, lead to our\r\nseparation, and deprive me of my loved Miss Evelyn. The idea made me\r\nvery sad, and I showed no alacrity in taking advantage of our extra\r\nhours of recreation with my sisters, until Mary began to rally me about\r\nmy melancholy, and asked what I meant by it. I at once said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see, if Miss Evelyn marries Mr. Vincent we shall get another\r\ngoverness, and can we ever expect to get one who is so kind and\r\nexcellent a teacher, and who troubles us so little at our games.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is very true, and we should be horribly annoyed if we were\r\nwatched and interrupted. However, more reason that we should make the\r\nmost of the present moment, so come along, Charlie, and let us have some\r\nreal good fucking. We have plenty of time, mamma is not very well. No\r\none will come near us, and there is nothing to hinder our having a jolly\r\ntime of it, all three stark naked together, so come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer words had already changed the current of my ideas; before she ceased\r\nspeaking my prick responded, which her quick eye immediately observed,\r\nand patting it with her hand, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear little dummy, I am glad to see you are of my opinion, so\r\ncome along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway we went, and a most glorious afternoon of orgies we spent.\r\n\r\nMiss Evelyn came to me at night and threw herself into my arms, in an\r\nagony of sobs and tears, and pressing me to her throbbing bosom, she\r\nsobbed out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear Charlie, I love you so dearly, you have become as necessary\r\nto me as life itself. I cannot bear the thought of parting from you, my\r\nloved one. You, whom I have initiated into all the delights of mutual\r\nlove. Oh! the thought of parting is bitter, and breaks my heart. Oh!\r\nlove me, my own darling boy, and press me to your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did more, for, as I have before stated, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tears have a never\r\nfailing effect on the erective nerves of my machine. It was but the\r\ncommencement of a night of most luxurious enjoyment. Miss Evelyn put no\r\nrestraint either on herself or me, but indulged in every act of\r\nlubricity and voluptuousness were drawing to a close. In fact, when\r\neventually she left me in the morning, and I thought over all she had\r\nsaid, it became evident to me that she had already made up her mind to\r\naccept the very advantageous offer made to her. The instinctive\r\nintelligence of woman had at once shown to her that such an opportunity\r\nwas not to be lost for the sake of a mere boy, whom circumstances must\r\nnaturally soon remove far away from her. At the same time, doubtless,\r\nthe idea that I was all her own making, for she never had any suspicion\r\nof my previous initiation, held a charm over her, to say nothing of the\r\npowerful weapon she had so unexpectedly found by her side, and which had\r\nso great an influence over her passions. We spent a most luxurious\r\nnight, and hardly closed our eyes, notwithstanding my afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndebauch; such is the power and resources of nature, in a\r\nwell-constituted youth of fifteen and upwards, that Miss Evelyn had\r\nrather to force our embraces, than to stimulate by any artificial\r\nexcitement my ever ready prick. I won from her a promise to come next\r\nnight, and let me know what fate was in store for us.\r\n\r\nNext day Mr. Vincent was true to his appointment. Mamma received him\r\nwith Miss Evelyn by her side, and after the usual compliments, rose and\r\napologised for leaving them, as she had household duties to attend to.\r\nMiss Evelyn informed me afterwards that Mr. Vincent, on my mother\r\nleaving the room, rose from his seat, and approaching her, said, in the\r\nmost frank gentlemanly manner\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are aware, my dear Miss Evelyn, of the object of my visit, and I\r\naugur from your kind condescension in giving me this interview that my\r\nsuit is not disagreeable to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen taking her passive hand, and pressing it to his heart, he\r\ncontinued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have loved you, Miss Evelyn, from the first moment of my seeing you.\r\nI feel that my future happiness hangs on your lips, for without your\r\nlove, my life would now be a blank. I am here today to offer you my hand\r\nand fortune. If I have not yet your heart, I seek to be allowed to\r\ncultivate your society, that I may try to win it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen seeing that she was greatly agitated, he begged her to be seated\r\n(for she had risen when he approached and took her hand), he led her to\r\na sofa, and seated himself by her side. He pressed for an answer. She\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be fully aware, Mr. Vincent, that your generous offer has\r\ntaken me greatly by surprise. I feel most grateful to you for it, but\r\nmust implore you to allow me to pause, until at least I have heard from\r\nmy mother, to whom I will communicate the noble offer you have made to\r\nme, a poor governess, who cannot but feel grateful to you for\r\ncondescending to think of her in such a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! say not so, my dear Miss Evelyn, and believe me, it is no sudden\r\nimpulse that has driven me to your feet, but ardent love, and real\r\nadmiration of your great beauty and admirable conduct ever since you\r\nentered this family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dear creature smiled through her tears upon me when she recounted\r\nthose terms of affection that Mr. Vincent poured out to her.\r\n\r\nTo be brief\xe2\x80\x94before they parted he won from her that his frequent\r\nmeetings at church, and elsewhere, had gained him something more than\r\nesteem, but hopeless of ever becoming his wife, she had done her utmost\r\nto suppress warmer feelings. Oh! woman, thy name is deception! So she\r\nsent him away the happiest man in existence. He rode over every day\r\nafterwards, and was with Miss Evelyn from four to five; indeed, he was\r\noften the cause of our having half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s longer recreation. He also\r\nfrequently dined with us. Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s mother naturally jumped at the\r\noffer, and most delightedly gave her consent.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Vincent heard of this, he became very urgent in claiming an\r\nearly day for making him the happiest of men. Miss Evelyn wanted a delay\r\nof six weeks, but this raised such an outcry on his part, seconded by my\r\nmother, that at last she was driven from six weeks to a month, and then\r\nto a fortnight from that date; so all became extremely busy in getting\r\nready marriage dresses, &amp;c. The marriage was to take place from our\r\nhouse, and my mother insisted that she should provide the marriage\r\nbreakfast. Mrs. Evelyn was invited to our house for a week at the time\r\nof the marriage, to keep my mother company. My two sisters and a young\r\nsister of Mr. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s were to be the bridesmaids, and a young man,\r\ncourting Miss Vincent, to be bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s man. So all was thus arranged,\r\nand eventually came off most happily. When Mrs. Evelyn arrived she\r\noccupied the spare room, where charming Mrs. Benson had so deliciously\r\ninitiated me in all the pleasures of sensuality and passion.\r\n\r\nTo return to the day when Mr. Vincent had his first interview, and\r\ndeclared his love and admiration, and ended with the offer of marriage.\r\nBefore going away, he rang for mamma, thanked her for all her kindness\r\nto him, informed her how happy Miss Evelyn had made him in granting\r\npermission to prosecute his suit for her hand, &amp;c. Then begging the\r\nfavour of a chaste kiss, he left all radiant with hope.\r\n\r\nThe interview had naturally been very trying for Miss Evelyn, and she\r\nwas so evidently nervously agitated that my mother begged her to go to\r\nher room, and lie down to repose herself, as after so much agitation she\r\nmust be quite unfit for any schoolwork, and that she herself would hear\r\nour lessons that morning and give us an afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s holiday in honour of\r\nthe happy event that had occurred.\r\n\r\nWe thus, my sisters and I, were thrown again into another prolonged\r\nopportunity of fully enjoying ourselves, but, notwithstanding the\r\nwonderfully regenerative power that nature had gifted me with, I felt\r\nthat if I wanted to enjoy again my dear Miss Evelyn, who had promised to\r\nbe with me that night. I must not only restrain myself from such excess\r\nas we had indulged in the previous day, but also manage to get some\r\nsleep, of which I had scarcely tasted the night before, so I contented\r\nmyself with first gamahuching and then fucking each sister; afterwards\r\nagain gamahuching them, and making them each spend five times, so as to\r\nsatisfy them without exhausting myself, and then finishing off with a\r\ndelicious fuck in Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole, while each gamahuched the other.\r\nThis quite satisfied them, and they allowed me to steal up to my room to\r\nsleep, Mary promising to call me in time for tea. I slept the sleep of\r\nthe just for some three hours, and came to tea perfectly ready for\r\nanything that could happen that night. It was well it was so, for now\r\nthat there could not be any long lapse of time before we must part, Miss\r\nEvelyn became a very glutton for pleasure, and every art and position\r\nwas made use of to stimulate and lengthen out our joys. She came every\r\nnight, even up to the very night before the marriage, although in the\r\nlast three nights before the event came off, her mother, Mrs. Evelyn,\r\nslept in the spare bedroom with which my room communicated.\r\nNevertheless, we met and carried on our amorous sports with bated breath\r\nand suppressed sighs.\r\n\r\nWe had of late often tried in our moments of greatest excitement to\r\nintroduce my prick into her delicious tight little bottom-hole. Once, by\r\na sudden manoeuvre, I managed to get in at the moment she was spending,\r\nand actually made an entrance as far as about two inches beyond the nut,\r\nand I think I should have fully succeeded at that time if my own\r\nexcitement had not made me spend too soon. This oiled the way, and my\r\nprick, having already fucked several times, becoming too limp, the\r\nsqueeze of her bottom actually forced him out, as if she were voiding\r\nherself naturally. I fancied that, at the moment, but for my too excited\r\npassion, she would have rather I had completely initiated her. However,\r\nthe night preceding her marriage, I at last succeeded. We had fucked in\r\nevery varied way. She was on her knees, with her head on the pillow, and\r\nI on my knees, behind her; this was a favourite way of hers, as she\r\ndeclared I got further in, nay, seemed to touch her heart and fill her\r\nwhole body; besides the frigging her clitoris and the action of my\r\nfinger in her bottom-hole added greatly to the raptures this position\r\ngave her. She had been already well fucked, and we had mutually\r\ngamahuched each other, so her whole system was in a most excited and\r\nwell-moistened state. Taking care to put two fingers at once into her\r\nbottom-hole, I worked them so as to stretch it as much as possible,\r\nwhile exciting her with my prick in her cunt, and a finger on her\r\nclitoris. Just as she was going into the raptures of spending I dropped\r\nfrom my mouth a quantity of saliva onto her bottom-hole, and as she was\r\npushing her buttocks back to me I suddenly withdrew my prick, and with\r\none vigorous thrust housed him half his length in her delicious\r\nbum-hole. She almost cried out aloud at the suddenness of the attack,\r\nand would have flinched away but for the grasp of both my hands upon her\r\nhips; a more vigorous shove sent me up to the hilt against her beautiful\r\nbuttocks. She whispered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, dear Charles, do stop a moment, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, and\r\nmust cry out if you do not be quiet for a time at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I was safely fixed, it exactly suited me to remain still, for had I\r\ngone on, a push or two would have made me spend. Now fairly engulphed, I\r\nwished not only to fully enjoy it myself but, if possible, make her\r\nenjoy it too. So remaining quite still, as far as regarded my prick, I\r\nstole one hand down to her clitoris, and began to excite that; the other\r\nI ran up to her bubbies, and played with the nipples, a thing which I\r\nhad found out excited her almost as much as playing with her clitoris.\r\nHer passions were soon reawakened, and the involuntary twistings of her\r\nloins and pressures of her sphincter convinced me that in a very short\r\ntime I should work her up to the utmost; and so it was, and immensely\r\nshe enjoyed both her own spend and mine when she felt my hot spunk\r\nshooting up into her very entrails. We sunk gently on our sides after\r\nthis bout, but without unsheathing me; and here embracing, kissing and\r\ntonguing each other when she turned her head, and sometimes sucking the\r\nnearest nipple to me, we soon once more were in a state to renew our\r\ndelicious combat; and a second course was run in the delightful\r\ncallipygian recesses of Venus\xe2\x80\x99s second temple of lubricity. This was our\r\nlast bout, for, alas, it was getting the hour when the house would be\r\nall astir. My lovely mistress embraced me most tenderly, and\r\nacknowledged that I had at last taught her a new pleasure. She wept as\r\nshe tore herself from my arms, and I wept too when she left me, as I\r\nthought I had now lost her for ever as a mistress, and what a charming\r\none she had been to me!\r\n\r\nMorning came, and with it bridesmaids, bridegroom, and man. To church we\r\nall went, my sisters perfectly enchanted with the idea of being\r\nbridesmaids, and beautifully arrayed in new dresses. They were also\r\nstill more delighted with some handsome jewelry presented by Mr.\r\nVincent. In their eyes he became the handsomest and finest man they had\r\never seen. The breakfast went off as usual, and when the bride, who had\r\nchanged her bridal dress for a neat travelling one, came down, pretty\r\nnear all were in tears on taking leave of her. She pressed me tenderly\r\nto her bosom, and whispered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, Charlie, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was almost too much for me, but I managed to restrain any extreme\r\ndemonstration of my grief. The carriage door was shut, and off they\r\nrattled to spend the honeymoon at Leamington. The friends assembled\r\nremained until the evening, and after the sensations of the day, and the\r\nfatigues of the previous night, I was glad to get to bed. I cried myself\r\nto sleep, thinking that another at that moment was revelling in all the\r\ndelights of amorous enjoyment of those charms that had been so long in\r\nmy sole possession.\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the most delightful episodes of my life, and although\r\nI, at some rare intervals, from time to time found an opportunity of\r\nenjoying my loved mistress, they were flying fucks, very delicious, but\r\nvery unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThis was the first great incident that had an effect of changing the\r\ntenour of our existence for some time, but I will reserve the details of\r\nour after-adventures for a second part of these reminiscences of Early\r\nExperiences.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. James MacCallum\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Vincent\xe2\x80\x94Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x94Miss F., Mary, and\r\nEliza\xe2\x80\x94Doctor and Mrs. Brownlow\r\n\r\nThe house was scarcely itself even the day after the marriage. Mrs.\r\nEvelyn was still with us, and did not leave until the following day. She\r\nand my mother spent most of the day in the summer house, so that our\r\npastimes therein were interrupted. Mary complained of severe headache,\r\nwhich, in fact, was the premonitory symptom of her courses, which\r\ndeclared themselves violently in the evening. I had arranged with my\r\nsisters to steal up to their room when all were asleep, as now that we\r\nhad lost our governess they had it all to themselves. I went, of course,\r\nbut found only Eliza capable of entering into our sensual enjoyments. I\r\nmade her come to me in Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and while fucking her, was\r\nthinking all the time of my darling governess; and even when I was\r\nfucking her I could only remember the complete insertion of my prick\r\ninto Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s bum-hole the very night before her marriage, and\r\nwondered whether or not her husband had discovered her loss of\r\nmaidenhead. And yet, I fancied woman\xe2\x80\x99s natural cunning would easily\r\ndeceive him, as millions before him have been deceived. Coupling Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattack and Miss Evelyn\xe2\x80\x99s choice of the marriage day on the full moon, I\r\ncould not help imagining that she intended to help her deception by the\r\nadvent of her menstruation. It will be seen hereafter how far I was\r\ncorrect in my conjecture. I passed a delicious night in the arms of my\r\ncharming Lizzie, and only stole away just in time not to be observed by\r\nthe early-rising servants. Mrs. Evelyn departed the next day. My mother,\r\nfeeling poorly, desired Lizzie to sleep with her, so perforce I had to\r\npass a very quiet night, but which the agitation and excessive venery of\r\nthe last week rendered very acceptable.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed without anything particular beyond Mary being able\r\nto join Lizzie and me in our orgies. The doctor had recommended my\r\nmother to go for a few weeks to the seaside, and she resolved that we\r\nshould all go for six weeks before engaging a new governess. So we left\r\ntown for a charming little retired village on the west Welsh coast. It\r\nwas but a small place, with one street, and some straggling houses here\r\nand there, but with a beautiful stretch of sand ending in abrupt rocks.\r\nOur lodgings were but small; a sitting room and bedroom above a shop,\r\nand two rooms over that. I slept in the small back room off the sitting\r\nroom, my mother had the front upper room, and my two sisters were in the\r\nroom beside her, with only a thin partition between them, so we found\r\nourselves obliged to seek for some outside place to enjoy the erotic\r\npleasures that had now become necessary to us. Very few visitors ever\r\ncame near the retired little village. In our explorations we found that\r\nat the far end of the sands there were some nice retired spots behind\r\nthe rocks, which soon became the scenes of our sensual enjoyments. The\r\nplace was more than a mile from the village, and we could see if anyone\r\nwas coming towards us for the whole distance; but still as we might\r\nforget how fast time flies, we prudently established either one or the\r\nother of my sisters as a sentinel to give us warning if anyone was\r\napproaching. So I took them in turn, laid them down, had a mutual\r\ngamahuche, and then a fuck; after which the previous watcher took the\r\nplace of the one just fucked, and the same process was followed in her\r\ncase. We had done this for three days, and were congratulating ourselves\r\nupon having found out so safe a place to indulge all our propensities\r\nin. We always spent the mornings with mamma, who kept us so far to our\r\nlessons, but after our midday meal, which mamma also made her dinner\r\nhour, she retired for a siesta, and we went out for a long walk and\r\nsomething better. I have said we fully enjoyed the first three days\r\nwithout any apparent chance of discovery. On the fourth, while Lizzie\r\nwas on the watch in front, and Mary and I after a delicious gamahuche\r\nhad just died away in all the ecstasies of a prolonged fuck up to the\r\nmoment of discharge, and I was saying to her\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid not that feel delicious, and was it not up to the hilt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so, with such a rammer as that up her cunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nstrange voice close to us.\r\n\r\nYou may easily suppose how we startled with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, I did not mean to spoil sport,\xe2\x80\x9d said the same voice.\r\n\r\nIt was a very gentlemanly man, with a soft quiet voice, and charming\r\namiable expression of countenance, who stood smiling upon us close to\r\nour side, with his breeches open, and his standing pego in his hand. So\r\ngreat was our surprise that we never thought of the state we were in.\r\nMary lay with legs spread out, and belly exposed, and cunt gaping open;\r\nand I with my breeches down, and my great big cock pendent, it is true,\r\nbut hardly diminished in thickness. The stranger said again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not here to spoil sport, on the contrary, to aid you in every way.\r\nI accidentally observed you two days ago. I am here, a stranger, like\r\nyourselves. I know you to be brother and sisters, and admire you all the\r\nmore for being above the usual prejudices of that relationship. But you\r\nmust be aware that as I know all about you, the best way is to let me be\r\na participator in your sport; and then you not only shut my mouth, but\r\nit will be the means of vastly adding to all your pleasures, as well as\r\ngiving me the most intense satisfaction. Now, for instance, your elder\r\nsister there, who was about to replace the younger on the watch, will be\r\nall the more satisfied, if I first fuck her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, as he observed a sudden move of Mary, who all at once\r\nrecollected how exposed her whole person was. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall do nothing\r\nwithout your full consent, but I am quite sure your brother, who takes\r\nyou each in turn, will rather be pleased than otherwise, to see you in\r\nmy arms, or I much mistake his character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help, internally, thinking how exactly he had hit off my\r\nvery thought, for I had just been calculating, in my own mind, how much\r\nbetter it would be for us to make him a participator with us, rather\r\nthan an enemy by a refusal. So I at once averred that as it had turned\r\nout, it was likely to add greatly to all our pleasure, and I begged Mary\r\nto let him have his way. The natural reluctance of woman to appear too\r\neasy of access made her simulate a refusal, but as she still lay on her\r\nback, I leant over her, and opening her legs, begged him to kneel\r\nbetween and help himself. He gallantly, on kneeling, first stooped\r\nforward, and gave a good lick up of all her cunt\xe2\x80\x99s spunk-covered lips,\r\nand then proceeded to gamahuche her, which quickly made her as anxious\r\nfor his prick as he was to fuck her. As soon as they were fairly at it,\r\nI whistled, and beckoned to Lizzie to come up. You may easily imagine\r\nher surprise to see Mary in the arms of a strange man; but as the sight\r\nhad had its usual effect on my sensitive organ, and as it was standing,\r\nalmost ready to burst, I made her kneel opposite to them, and introduced\r\nmy prick into her cunt from behind, so that we could both see the\r\ndelicious fuck going on before us. It redoubled our excitement, and all\r\nfour of us spent together in cries of rapture. After this bout we sat\r\ndown to make further acquaintance, which, you may suppose, was not\r\ndifficult, after such an introduction. Our new friend gave us some hints\r\nvery useful for future proceedings, meanwhile he was feeling young\r\nLizzie\xe2\x80\x99s cunt with one hand, and my prick with the other, very nicely\r\nand gently frigging it. He brought me to full stand very quickly, and\r\nthen made me lie on my back, while he proceeded to admire and praise the\r\nextraordinary development which he declared was the greatest for one of\r\nmy age he had ever met with, and his experience was very extensive. When\r\nit was at full stand, he stooped forward, and in the most delicious\r\nmanner sucked my prick. It was more exciting than when either of my\r\nsisters, Miss Evelyn, or Mrs. Benson had gamahuched me. He also inserted\r\na finger in my bottom-hole, and eventually made me spend in his mouth,\r\nwhich he greedily swallowed, nor did he cease sucking until every drop\r\nwas drawn out of me. This had, of course, excited him, and he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I must have the young one in her turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLizzie, nothing loath, lay down on the grass at once, I conducted his\r\nprick into her cunt, and frigged his bottom-hole, while their bout\r\nlasted. His prick was one of the middlings, not very long, nor very\r\nthick, but of a uniform size throughout, without any large projection of\r\nthe nut, like mine. He advised us to stop for that day, and to walk\r\ntowards the village with him, and then when in full sight, but far\r\nbeyond hearing, we could sit down and concert measures for future\r\npleasures of the most delicious lubricity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we shall just hit it. I shall greatly add to\r\nyour pleasures, and you to mine; you have something yet to learn, and I\r\nam the very person to instruct you in even higher delights than any of\r\nyou have yet enjoyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe followed him as desired, and, seated on a sand hillock, we held a\r\nlong conversation, and arranged everything for future indulgencies. We\r\nagreed to meet at the rocks next day at our usual hour, he undertaking\r\nto be there ahead of us, to see that no lurking stranger should have\r\nhidden himself as he had done that day. He would think over the matter\r\nin the meantime, and contrive some way of meeting where we could be\r\nfully at ease, and strip ourselves naked, so as to enjoy a complete\r\norgie of the most salacious lubricity. He showed us where he was lodged,\r\na small inn a little way out of the village with its front to the road,\r\nand behind the stables there was attached to it a small cottage,\r\nconsisting of a bedroom above, with a dressing room, or small bedroom if\r\nnecessary, over the passage; the door opened upon the coast, and there\r\nwas no other communication with the inn than by going round past the\r\nstable yard to the front door. The servant of the inn came round in the\r\nmorning, and laid his modest breakfast of tea, eggs and toast, and when\r\nhe was done, cleared away and made his bed, &amp;c. He took his dinner in\r\nthe inn parlour at the hour the landlord and family dined. Nothing\r\noverlooked his windows, and he was sufficiently away from the village\r\nnot to be easily observed, still less so from the inn; so that on\r\napproaching his lodgings from the sands he was almost as safe from\r\nobservation as if he had lived in a lonely house far distant from any\r\nother. I am thus particular in describing his lodgings, as the\r\nadvantages of the situation afterwards induced us to turn them to a\r\nprofitable use. Our friend\xe2\x80\x99s name was MacCallum, James MacCallum, an\r\noffshoot of the great Scotch clan of that name, then in about his\r\nthirtieth year, fond of sporting, particularly fishing. His room was\r\nsurrounded with the necessary implements, and he much frequented Wales\r\nfrom its advantage of possessing so many good trout streams. He it was\r\nwho gave me a taste for the piscatory art, and I afterwards accompanied\r\nhim on many a fishing excursion, which often led to new and singular\r\nerotic adventures, of which I may, perhaps, hereafter recount a few. His\r\nordinary residence was London, and our present acquaintance led to some\r\nmost intimate relations of true erotic extravagance, of which more anon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we met at the rocks on the next day, a Saturday. We found Mr.\r\nMacCallum at his post, and all being secure, proceeded to action. It was\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s turn to take the first watch. Our friend constituted himself\r\nmaster of the ceremonies. He desired me to take off my breeches, and\r\nLizzie to take off her gown and ease her corset, for as yet she wore no\r\nstays; then telling me to lie down on my back, he made Lizzie kneel at\r\nmy head, with her bottom to me, and then to press back so as to bring\r\nher charming little cunt over my mouth, her under-petticoat and chemise\r\nbeing well canted over her shoulders. I thus had complete command of her\r\nclitoris with my tongue, and she could sink her buttocks quite down on\r\nmy face, so that I could shove my tongue well up her cunt, and lick up\r\nall her spendings when she discharged; and at the same time, while\r\nembracing the charming plump hard buttocks with one hand, the other was\r\nleft free to frig her bum-hole, and stimulate her passions up to the\r\nutmost. I have already told you how naturally she had taken to posterior\r\npleasures. While thus engaged, Mr. MacCallum proceeded to gamahuche my\r\nprick in the most delicious manner, for he had an art in this delightful\r\naccomplishment that far exceeded that of the many by whom I have been\r\ngamahuched\xe2\x80\x94of course, he added the _postilion_, as the French say, by\r\nfrigging my bottom-hole at the same time. He made me most voluptuously\r\ndischarge in his mouth at the very instant dear Lizzie was pouring into\r\nmine her delicious spendings. We lay enraptured for some time before we\r\ncould stir. Then rising, I wished to return the compliment Mr. M. had\r\npaid my prick, by sucking his. But this he declined, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall teach you all a new pleasure before we part, and my powers are\r\nnot quite so active as your youth enables you to be, so for the moment\r\nwe will indulge in close observation and sweet caresses of our members\r\nuntil by gentle titillations I get you two more prepared for the amorous\r\ncontest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gamahuched Lizzie while handling my prick, and a very short period\r\nelapsed before he had us both in such a state of excitement that we were\r\nready for anything he chose to direct. This time he also required me to\r\nlie down on my back, but he placed Lizzie on the top of me, and guided\r\nmy prick himself into her delicious tight little notch. When fully\r\ninserted, which was completely accomplished before she quite lay down\r\nupon me, he desired us to go slowly to work. For a short time, with his\r\nface close to my cods, he watched the in and out movement of my prick,\r\ninserting a finger into both Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s bottom and mine. Then rising, he\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a little, my dears, but don\xe2\x80\x99t withdraw. I am about to give your\r\nsister a lesson in the double action of most delicious pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen spitting on his prick, and applying a quantity of saliva to the\r\nrosy orifice of her bottom, he proceeded to insert his prick\xe2\x80\x94little\r\nthinking how fond she was of taking pleasure in this route, and how\r\noften she had already enjoyed it. He took every precaution not to hurt\r\nher, and to be as gentle as possible, telling her to push out her\r\nbottom, and to strain as if she wanted to void something, which he told\r\nher would facilitate his entrance, and give her less pain. You may\r\nimagine how secretly pleased Lizzie was; she did all he desired\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\ngreat gentleness he succeeded in sheathing his prick up to the close\r\njunction of his belly against her buttocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital, my dear, you have borne it admirably. I see you will make an\r\napt scholar; now you will have nothing but the most ecstatic raptures\r\nfrom the action of two pricks at once. Now, Charles, it is for you to\r\nwork, and for your most charming sister to continue only the exquisite\r\npressures she is already at this moment so rapturously conferring on our\r\nexcited members.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe thus commenced the first lesson we ever had in the double fuck. Dear\r\nLizzie was almost mad with the agonising sensations of rapturous\r\npleasure the double thrusting produced upon her erotic nerves. I, too,\r\nfelt the rubbing of Mr. M.\xe2\x80\x99s prick so closely upon mine, for the slight\r\nmembrane dividing the bottom passage from the vagina, by the powerful\r\nstretching of the two members between which it was sandwiched, became so\r\nthin a division that it really appeared as if there was nothing between\r\nour pricks. Such ecstatic excitement brought matters to a speedy\r\nconclusion. Lizzie screamed so loudly with her excess of pleasure that\r\nit somewhat alarmed Mary, who came running up to see what was the\r\nmatter. Her surprise was great at the sight she beheld, but we were far\r\ntoo deliriously wrapt in the lap of most salacious luxury and lubricity\r\nto be sensible to any interruption. As for Lizzie she was in convulsions\r\nof ecstasy, which ended in quite a hysteric attack which rather alarmed\r\nus, and made us withdraw from the exquisite sheaths in which we had been\r\nengulphed with such rapture. It was some time before dear Lizzie\r\nrecovered her senses, and then she burst into tears, declaring she had\r\nnever before known what pleasure meant, and she had been in the seventh\r\nheaven of delight, that she could wish for no better death than to die\r\nin such agony of pleasure. She then threw herself into Mr. M.\xe2\x80\x99s arms,\r\nand kissing him with the utmost fervour, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you dear man, how I love you for teaching me such a delicious way\r\nof loving; you shall have me whenever and wherever you please. I shall\r\nlove you as much as I do my darling brother Charlie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then turned to me and warmly embraced me too. Then, putting on her\r\ngown, she proceeded to take up the watch, while Mary remained to be\r\nlikewise initiated in the luxury of the double fuck. She somewhat\r\ndreaded the experiment, but having witnessed the ecstasies of pleasure\r\nit had thrown Lizzie into, she was not unwilling to try if it could be\r\naccomplished with Mr. MacCallum\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat less massive member. He put\r\nus through the same preliminary manoeuvres of backing Mary on her knees\r\nover my mouth, and while he sucked my prick, he feasted his eyes at the\r\nsame time on Mary\xe2\x80\x99s really finely developed buttocks, giving him promise\r\nof great after-pleasure. He even begged me to leave her bottom-hole to\r\nhis finger so that he frigged the bum-hole of the sister while he sucked\r\nthe prick of the brother, a combination which afforded him the most racy\r\ndelight, Mary was greatly excited, and spent most copiously in my mouth,\r\nwhile I quickly followed suit in the mouth of Mr. M., who did not allow\r\na drop to be wasted. When we had reposed ourselves sufficiently, his\r\nlascivious touches and caresses and praises of our parts soon\r\nsufficiently re-excited us to let him see if we might again proceed to\r\naction. As before, I lay down on my back, and Mary, straddling across\r\nme, had my prick guided into her longing cunt by the hand of Mr. M. When\r\nI was fairly engulphed in her hot and throbbing cunt, she began her\r\nexquisite _casse-noisette_ pressures, which talent she possessed in the\r\ngreatest perfection; then bending down to me I clasped her in my arms,\r\nand glued my lips to hers in a loving kiss and tongue embrace. Her\r\nbottom presented itself in all its beauty to our worthy master of the\r\nceremonies, who, delighted with its more fully blown beauties than that\r\nof the younger sister, paid first due homage to it by fondly kissing it,\r\nand thrusting his tongue up the rosy orifice, titillating her\r\nexcessively, then wetting his prick he applied it to the tender\r\nrosebud-like dimple at first without success, Mary telling him she did\r\nnot think he could possibly succeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience and perseverance, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwill enable me to\r\nget into a mouse; we must try another way; it is that great huge monster\r\nof a prick in your cunt that is so blocking up the route as to close\r\nalmost entirely the way to the more secret temple of salacious delights.\r\nWithdraw for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so; upon which he plunged in an instant up to the hilt in her cunt\r\nand gave a few shoves to excite her and throw her off her guard, for he\r\ntold us afterwards, the first difficulty was all owing to Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvoluntary opposition, by squeezing in her bottom-hole, instead of\r\npushing it out. When he thought he had sufficiently excited her, and\r\nmade her suppose he was going to continue regularly fucking her, he\r\nsuddenly withdrew the two fingers he had in her bum-hole, by a jerk\r\nsubstituted his prick, and before Mary was aware, had sheathed it more\r\nthan halfway into her bottom. She gave a half scream, but his hold of\r\nher hips, and my close embrace of her waist, for I all along knew what\r\nhe was at, prevented her from flinching and throwing him out, which was\r\nher first impulse. He said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will keep still, and any unpleasant feeling will go off in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped for two or three minutes, which I occupied in first rubbing\r\nthe end of my prick on Mary\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris, which was a well-developed one,\r\nand when by her nervous movements I found her passions were being\r\nroused, I slipped it into her tightened cunt without much difficulty.\r\nMr. M. took the opportunity of finding me penetrating to glide in on his\r\npoint of attack up to his utmost limit. Mary gasped again, and declared\r\nit was choking her. However, by a little more patience, and then by very\r\ngentle movements, we gradually worked her up to the utmost state of\r\nexcitement, and she, as well as both of us, went off in a delirium of\r\nenraptured felicity. She lay panting and throbbing between us for nearly\r\na quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nI was already in a state for renewed efforts, but Mr. M. rose, and\r\nwithdrew his reeking prick from the tight recess in which it had enjoyed\r\nsuch ecstasies, and told us we must be content with that day\xe2\x80\x99s work,\r\nexpressly as he had a plan in his head for the next day, that would\r\nrequire us to have all our erotic powers at command. Then, as before, we\r\napproached the village, so as to be seen, but not overheard, so that our\r\ngoing away to more distant places should create no suspicion. Mr. M.\r\nthen informed us that we could come to his cottage the next afternoon,\r\ninstead of the rocks; we should be able to undress ourselves in the\r\nbuff, and have a perfect orgie of salacious delights. We heartily\r\napproved of this plan, and after an amusing conversation, we parted to\r\nmeet the next day on the sands, but in the contrary directions to the\r\nrocks, for the purpose of afterwards approaching his cottage from the\r\nleast observable site.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the next day we started at our usual hour apparently for\r\nour ordinary promenade, but after leaving the village, and allowing most\r\nof the people to be safely stowed away in church for the afternoon\r\nservice, we turned on our steps and made for Mr. M.\xe2\x80\x99s door. He saw us\r\ncoming, and was ready to admit us, without knocking. We immediately\r\nadjourned to the bedroom upstairs, and lost no time in all of us\r\nstripping stark naked. After some preliminary admiration of the two\r\ngirls, whose forms were certainly cast in beauty\xe2\x80\x99s mould, we lay down in\r\nbed. I and Lizzie mutually gamahuched each other, with the usual\r\naccompaniments in the charming orifices of our bottoms. Mr. MacCallum\r\nand Mary, for he had taken a great fancy to her and her splendid bottom,\r\nfollowed our example, After we had a happy and most delicious spend, and\r\nthen mutual embraces and kisses, we put the girls into all conceivable\r\nposes, until we were once more ready to go on with something more\r\nserious than gamahuching. Mr. M., as usual, acted as master of the\r\nceremonies, and ordered Mary to lie down on her back, then Lizzie\r\nreversed upon her, so that she could gamahuche Mary\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, and tickle\r\nher bum-hole, while Mary was to frig Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris with one hand,\r\nand play with my cods with the other, Mr. M. himself guided my prick\r\ninto the delicious bottom-hole of Lizzie, and when we were all fixed,\r\nand he had frigged my bum-hole with two fingers, he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am going to initiate you, Charlie, into the delight of being\r\nalike operator and receiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he moistened his tool and spit in my bum-hole, and proceeded\r\nvery gently to introduce his prick therein. I have described his cock as\r\nnot very thick at the point, consequently the first part introduced\r\nitself very easily, but when the pillar pushed its way in, and began to\r\nstretch the parts, it produced a curious sickening feeling, very like as\r\nif I had received a kick on the bottom; so I was obliged to ask him to\r\nhalt a little. He was too experienced in the art not to fully understand\r\nmy feelings, and knew well it would go off in a minute or two, if I was\r\nleft quiet. So pausing until I told him he might now try to get in\r\nfurther, he drew back a little and applying more spittle to the shaft,\r\ngently and firmly, and slowly guided his prick up to the hilt, or as far\r\nas his belly and my buttocks would allow. Again pausing a little, until\r\nfeeling by the throbbing of my prick, which produced the same pressure\r\non my bum-hole, that I was warming to the work, he began slow movements\r\nof thrusts in and out, which, together with the hot and voluptuous\r\npressures and movements of my own little partner excited both by Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger and my prick, began to fire my passions, and we soon grew very\r\nfierce in our movements. Nothing I could ever have imagined equalled the\r\nextraordinary and delicious ecstasy that the double action produced upon\r\nmy erotic nerves. I gasped, I shuddered with the agony of intense\r\npleasure, and at the moment when the grand and rapturous finale\r\napproached, I actually brayed exactly like a donkey, which, in after\r\ncooler moments, amused all of us. The action of pleasure had come upon\r\nall at once, and we sank in an inert mass on those below us. How poor\r\nMary endured it astonished us, but the scene had so excited her that she\r\nsaid it never occurred to her, and she felt nothing. We eventually rose,\r\nand after a necessary purification, partook of wine and cake, which Mr.\r\nMacCallum, with great foresight, had provided. After that he would not\r\nallow us to fuck for some time; and we had a regular romp all about the\r\nroom, which we enjoyed very much, and nothing was heard but slaps on our\r\nbottoms, and the wildest rollicking laughter\xe2\x80\x94until our two cocks, by\r\ntheir stiff-standing, showed that we were again ready to enter on new\r\ncombats. This time Lizzie lay down, Mary gamahuched her. Mr. M. got into\r\nher bum-hole, and I proceeded to attempt to do the same to him, but all\r\nto no purpose. I was too heavy hung for his bottom-hole, a very small\r\none for a man. He had every wish to accommodate me, but do what I would,\r\nI could not overcome the physical difficulties. So reversing our\r\npositions, I lay on my back, Mary straddled over me, my prick was put\r\ninto her cunt, and stooping down, and presenting her anus, M. succeeded\r\nmore easily than the day before in getting into her bum-hole. Lizzie\r\nstanding up with a leg on each side of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s and my body, brought her\r\nquim up to M.\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and he luxuriously gamahuched her, while his\r\nfinger acted _postilion_ in her bottom. The erotic storm raged with\r\ngreat fury for a long time, and then, growing more fast and furious,\r\nbrought us all standing in ecstasies of the most salacious enjoyment,\r\nfor us to sink once more into the annihilation of satiated desire. We\r\nlay long wrapped in close embrace. Recovering our senses in long-drawn\r\nsighs, we again refreshed ourselves with wine and cake, and as our\r\npassions were not so quickly reawakened as those of our more excitable\r\ncompanions, we proceeded to gamahuche them, without their exercising a\r\nlike skill upon our pricks. We then had another romp, and replacing Mary\r\nbelow and Lizzie above, I, this time, fucked her cunt, at her request,\r\nas she said it must not be altogether neglected. M., as previously, took\r\nme behind, and as there was a greater facility, so there was greater\r\nenjoyment, and as our previous exertions had taken off the sharper\r\nappetite, we were enabled to draw out our pleasure to a much greater\r\nlength, until at last we died away in all the agony of such a glorious\r\nconjunction of parts. We had one more delicious general fuck before we\r\nparted. Lizzie was again fucked by me, and buggered by Mr. M., which she\r\ndeclared she preferred to any other combination, my prick so deliriously\r\ngorging her tight little cunt, and making M.\xe2\x80\x99s prick, from the pressure\r\nof my larger weapon in the cunt, feel as tight in her bottom as my prick\r\ndid, when nothing but Mary\xe2\x80\x99s finger was in her cunt. We ran our course\r\nwith even greater luxury and lasciviousness than before. Lizzie actually\r\nwas hysterical with the force of her enjoyment, and we all sank sideways\r\noff poor Mary, and lay long locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. This, for that\r\nday, ended our most delightful orgie. We purified ourselves, and then\r\ndressed. We parted with many sweet embraces, and promises of renewing\r\nthe delightful scenes we had just gone through, and, in fact, we often\r\nand often repeated them, varying from time to time with a visit to the\r\nrocks, lest we should draw observation upon us by constantly going to\r\nthe cottage.\r\n\r\nOur six weeks came to an end so rapidly that we could hardly believe the\r\ntime had already passed. Mamma one morning informed us we were to leave\r\non the day after the next. You may suppose our disappointment, but there\r\nwas no help for it. We met that day at the rocks, we were melancholy at\r\nthe thought of parting with our charming friend, whom we now really\r\nloved. We were not near so fiery as usual, but resolved to have one\r\nthorough good orgie the next day at the cottage, as a farewell benefit\r\nto us all. We met, as agreed on, and put in force every art to augment\r\nour pleasures, and every contrivance to excite anew our powers to the\r\nutmost. Both M. and I must have spent six to seven times, but the girls\r\nbeing more easily excited in their finer organs of coition, went off in\r\necstasies some nine or ten times; until fairly exhausted, we had, from\r\nwant of power, to give up the game, dress and part. We hoped to meet\r\nagain. The girls wept at parting with our delightful friend, to whom we\r\nowed so many delicious orgies. We exchanged addresses, and he promised\r\nto come on a fishing excursion to our neighbourhood, where he hoped we\r\nshould find means of renewing the lascivious sports we had already so\r\nmuch enjoyed. We tore ourselves away from him at last. It will be seen\r\nin the sequel, that unforeseen events carried me to London, or rather\r\naway from home, before we could meet again; and it was in London, at his\r\nown chambers, where we again renewed our charming intercourse, and\r\npractised every art of venery.\r\n\r\nWe returned home, and mamma again advertised for a governess, and stated\r\nthat she required one of not less than thirty years of age, and with\r\nmuch experience in teaching. Numerous responses were made to the\r\nadvertisement; but one lady desired to see mamma and her pupils before\r\naccepting the place, at the same time forwarding very satisfactory\r\ntestimonials. Mamma was rather struck with the style of letter, and the\r\nunusual demand of previous acquaintance before entering into final\r\narrangements. So she wrote to Miss Frankland, begging her to come and\r\nspend three days with us, and if her visit should prove as agreeable to\r\nboth as her letter had done to mamma, she had no doubt matters might be\r\narranged to their mutual satisfaction. Accordingly, at the expected\r\nhour, Miss Frankland arrived. She was, to our then thinking, an elderly\r\nlady, rather above thirty years of age than under, of tall and\r\ncommanding figure, somewhat large, but no superfluous fat, broad\r\nshouldered, and wide hipped, with bosoms well separated, but not too\r\nprominent. Her hair was coal black, and her eyes equally so, but with\r\nthe most determined expression, rendered more so by very thick eyebrows,\r\nwhich met in the middle. She showed also a well marked downy moustache,\r\nand the small curly hairs below her head, at the back of her neck,\r\nliterally lost themselves beneath her high-necked dress. She always wore\r\nlong sleeves, and never showed bare arms. I afterwards found the reason\r\nof this was that her arms were so black with thick hair that she was\r\nashamed to let them be seen, although, in reality, beautifully formed\r\nand plump. Her mouth was large; it showed animal passion, but at the\r\nsame time determined firmness of character. You could not call her\r\nhandsome, but there was altogether an appearance of face, expression,\r\nand person that might well be styled a fine woman. As for us, at the\r\nperiod of first seeing her, we only marked the determined character of\r\nher countenance, and at once dreaded her becoming our governess, as we\r\nfelt we should not only have one who would master us, but who would also\r\nbe severe in every way. Youth is often a better physiognomist than it is\r\ncredited with. It will be seen in the sequel whether we had judged\r\ncorrectly or not. Suffice it to say that her three days\xe2\x80\x99 visit ended in\r\nher being perfectly satisfied with the offered position, and mamma being\r\nequally satisfied with her. We did not know at the time, but afterwards\r\nfound out, that she had made it a _sine qua non_ that she should have\r\ncarte blanche as to the use of the rod. She had observed to mamma that\r\nshe thought we had been too leniently treated by our late governess, and\r\nit would be necessary to exert severe discipline, which, in her own\r\nexperience, she had always found most efficacious. My mother, who had\r\nduring the last two months found us rather headstrong and wilful, quite\r\nchimed in with her idea, and gave every authority to do quite as she\r\nliked, either with her girls or her son.\r\n\r\nTerms being so arranged, Miss Frankland required a week to make all her\r\narrangements before definitely taking up her new residence. My mother,\r\nthinking we should be well kept in on the arrival of Miss Frankland,\r\nleft us in uninterrupted liberty until then, you may be sure we improved\r\nthe occasion, and did our best to make up for the loss of our\r\ninestimable and amiable friend, Mr. MacCallum. Not only did we make use\r\nof the summer house by day, but every night I stole up to my loved\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, where we tried to emulate the luxurious scenes of\r\nlubricity we had lately been so deliriously indulging in at the seaside\r\nin Wales. Of course, the week passed far too quickly, and on the\r\nappointed day my mother drove into the town to bring Miss Frankland\r\nhome, on the arrival of the coach. My two sisters accompanied her, as\r\nsomething or other was always wanted for the girls; and as Miss\r\nFrankland and her luggage would quite fill the carriage on their return,\r\nI was left by myself at home, a most fortunate circumstance, as it\r\nturned out.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat annoyed at being left alone. But how true it is that \xe2\x80\x9cman\r\nproposes and God disposes.\xe2\x80\x9d Had I gone with them I should have missed a\r\nmost delicious and unexpected treat. I had strolled to the summer house\r\nin a sort of despair at the lost opportunity of again fucking my sisters\r\nbefore the arrival of the dreaded governess. I was listlessly gazing out\r\nof the window when I suddenly became aware of a lady waving her hand to\r\nme from a gig coming down the road which our summer house commanded. In\r\nan instant I recognised Mrs. Vincent. To run down the hillock, unbolt\r\nthe private door, and welcome her to our house, was the work of a\r\nmoment. I begged her to get out and walk to the house through the\r\ngrounds, her servant could drive round to the stables and wait there.\r\nShe did so at once. I never said a word of all being absent until I had\r\nher safe in the summer house. Without a word I seized her round the\r\nwaist, and pressing her back on the couch, quickly unbuttoned my\r\ntrousers, and pulling up her petticoats, was pushing my stiff prick\r\nagainst her belly before she was almost aware of my intentions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you at? We shall be discovered,\r\nand it will be my ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, my ever loved Mrs. Vincent; they are all away to town, and we\r\nhave nothing to fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe loved me too well to make further resistance; on the contrary,\r\nseconding me with all her accustomed art, we both quickly sunk in all\r\nthe voluptuous raptures of satisfied desire. I would not quit my\r\nposition, but kissing her rapturously, I shoved my tongue into her\r\nmouth, and stopped her remonstrances. The excitement of meeting her\r\nafter a two months\xe2\x80\x99 separation stimulated my passions to the utmost, and\r\nwith hardly bated breath I began a fresh career, but with more\r\nmoderation and greater pains to make her a perfect participant in the\r\nraptures I myself was receiving. She thoroughly enjoyed it, and being\r\nrelieved from any fear of surprise, after my informing her of the\r\nabsence of all the family, she gave way to all the force of her ardent\r\namorous propensities, enjoyed our delicious fuck thoroughly, and spent\r\nat the same time as myself with screams of satiated passion. After this\r\nI withdrew. She kissed me most tenderly, and said I was as bad and wild\r\na boy as ever, that she loved me too tenderly ever to refuse me anything\r\nI desired, and begged me to sit by her side and talk of old times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, tell me all about yourself; I have not\r\nseen you since your marriage day, and I want to know how the after-part\r\nwent off. I was in dread lest our embracings should have left traces\r\nthat would make your husband suspect you were not all he had\r\nanticipated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a strange boy, my dear Charlie, and more of a man in every way\r\nthan many ten years older than yourself. Who would have thought such\r\nideas would have been running through so young a head. Well, my darling\r\nboy, I was somewhat uneasy on that very point myself, and, indeed, had\r\nfixed the marriage day when I expected I should be unwell on the very\r\nnight, but in that I was disappointed; nothing came, and I was driven to\r\nact in the best way I could. I kept my legs close together. I got my\r\nhand down to that part of my person, and kept squeezing my affair as\r\nclose as possible. I pressed hard with my fingers on his weapon as he\r\nforced an entrance, and all at once gave way with a scream of apparent\r\npain, as he gave an extra thrust, and let him penetrate at once. An\r\ninexperienced husband takes much on credit and imagination, I quite\r\nsatisfied him that he was the first possessor of my person; but, oh! my\r\nbeloved Charlie, I found I was really ready in the family-way, and you,\r\nmy dear fellow, are the father of the baby now within my womb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? I! I! the father of your baby? Oh, dear, darling Mrs. Vincent;\r\noh, say that again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed true, my dear Charlie; and the knowledge that I first\r\npossessed you, and you me, reconciles me to giving my husband a child\r\nthat is not his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child! my child!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, and I danced round in a paroxysm of\r\ndelight at the idea of being a father. It seemed at once to elevate me\r\nto manhood, and puffed me up with pride. I rushed upon dear Mrs. V.,\r\nembraced her most warmly, and pushing her back on the sofa, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see how the little angel looks in his cell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned up her petticoats, and exposed all her beauteous belly, already\r\nby its swelling showing there was more there than ever went into her\r\nmouth. Her cunt too had become more prominent. I stooped, kissed her\r\nlovely quim, gave it a good suck, then gamahuched her till she cried out\r\nfor my prick to fuck her, and a most exquisite and rapturous fuck we\r\nhad. The thought that I was baptising my own babe with my sperm\r\nstimulated my lubricity, and we ran a course of the most libidinous\r\ndelights until we dissolved away in the most voluptuous death-like\r\nexhaustion of satisfied desires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, my darling, you must get up; remember you may injure the dear\r\nlittle creature by too great an excess, so pray rise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose at once, but only to embrace her most tenderly. She complained of\r\nfeeling somewhat faint, and said we must now go to the house to get some\r\nwine. We put ourselves in order, and all radiant at the thoughts of\r\npaternity, I strutted along as proud as a peacock, and thinking no small\r\nbeer of myself. I hardly knew whether I stood on my head or my heels,\r\nand was quite extravagant in my conduct. Dear Mrs. V. was obliged\r\nseriously to caution me before I could come to a proper reserved\r\nbehaviour in presence of the servants. She rested about half an hour,\r\nand was about to order the gig up to the door, but I implored her to\r\nsend it round to the road below the summer house, as I should all the\r\nlonger have the pleasure of being with her. She smiled, and again gave\r\nme a pat on the cheek, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, you rogue,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut did as I suggested. So we proceeded through the grounds, and were at\r\nthe summer house some time before the gig could be harnessed and come\r\nround to the road below. I did not wait for that, but embracing darling\r\nMrs. V., wanted to push her down on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, dear Charlie, that will tumble my dress too much, and we shall\r\nhave no time to put it in order; stop, I will kneel on the low couch,\r\nand you will stand behind, I can guide you from below, and you know I\r\nalways thought you got further in and gave me more pleasure that way\r\nthan any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt down, and I canted her clothes right over her shoulders, and\r\nexhibited her fine buttocks, which, now she was in the family-way, had\r\nwidened out, and were fatter and rounder than ever. First gluttonously\r\nkissing them, I brought my prick right against them. Mrs. Vincent\r\nprojected her hand behind, seized and guided him into her glowing and\r\nlonging cunt, and he plunged at one bound up to the hilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, Charlie dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cremember our dear baby is there, and\r\nyou must not be too violent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis at once reduced me to moderation. I had a hand on each hip, and as\r\nI slowly glided in, I pressed her splendid buttocks backwards to meet\r\nme. I kept my body upright so as to enjoy the lovely sight of the\r\nmovement of her bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your arm round and feel my clitoris, Charlie, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so for a minute, and then whispered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is such delight to gaze on your splendid bum in action, so pray\r\napply your own finger to your clitoris, and let me enjoy the lovely\r\nsight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I could feel her frigging away most furiously. This enabled me to\r\nintroduce first one and then two fingers into her most delicious\r\nbottom-hole. When I found she was in the greatest state of excitement, I\r\nsuddenly shifted my prick, and substituted it for my fingers. In her\r\nsurprise and excitement, she had no time to resist, and I glided in, not\r\ntoo rapidly, quite up as far as I could go. She flinched a little, and\r\ncalled me a bad fellow, but I held her hips too tight to allow of her\r\nunseating me, even if she had wished. I begged she would let me go on,\r\nfor I had never forgotten the delight of doing it this way the night\r\nbefore her marriage. She made no reply, but I could feel redoubled\r\naction with her finger on her clitoris; and the muscular twitchings of\r\nher loins and sphincter soon convinced me that nothing would please her\r\nbetter than finishing our course where I was\xe2\x80\x94and most delicious it\r\nproved. We should have died away in loud cries of agonised delight but\r\nfor the necessity of prudence, for doubtless the gig was then awaiting\r\nbut a few yards off. My darling mistress seemed unwilling to let me\r\nwithdraw; she held my prick in such close and firm embrace, throbbing on\r\nit from moment to moment, and so exciting him that she shortly felt he\r\nwas again stiffening inside of her. She rose on her legs, and by that\r\naction unsheathed me. Then, turning round, she threw her arms about my\r\nneck, and most tenderly embraced me, thanking me for having given her\r\nsuch exquisite proofs of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must go, my dear Charlie, and I hope we shall have occasionally\r\nsome other delicious opportunity of enjoying such raptures again. Say\r\neverything kind to your mother and the girls, and tell them I shall come\r\never again shortly and see them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw her into her gig, and watched her until a turn in the road hid her\r\nfrom my sight. I returned to the summer house, and kissed the spot she\r\nhad last pressed with her lovely body. My soul was filled with love of\r\nher, and pride that I was man enough to put a babe into her belly. I\r\nstrutted about the room, and if anyone could have seen me I should\r\ndoubtless have appeared ridiculous. Mamma, our new governess, and the\r\ngirls returned to tea. I told them of Mrs. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and her\r\nregret at finding them absent, also of her promise to drive over again\r\non an early day. My mother hoped I had been attentive to her. I said I\r\nhad, as well as I could, and had got some wine and biscuits, as she\r\ncomplained of not feeling very well, she thought the jolting road had\r\ntired her.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that after the impression our new governess had\r\nmade upon us, we were very attentive for some time. Indeed, her system\r\nof teaching was really excellent, far superior, in that respect, to our\r\nformer governess. She had a method of interesting you in what she was\r\nteaching, and for quite two months we paid such great attention, and\r\nmade such really extraordinary progress, that she could not help\r\npraising us highly to mamma while we were in the room. This was bad\r\npolicy, because, with the natural thoughtlessness of youth, we fancied\r\nourselves so clever that we became less attentive. This was patiently\r\nborne with for some time, probably in consequence of our previous good\r\nbehaviour. But at last Lizzie was somewhat impudent when blamed rather\r\nharshly by Miss Frankland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it has come to that, has it? We shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d She continued our\r\nlessons until four o\xe2\x80\x99clock as usual, and then desired Lizzie to remain\r\nwhere she was; she dismissed Mary and me, locked the door on poor\r\nLizzie, and went away, doubtless for a rod. She soon returned, and\r\nlocking herself in, most severely whipped poor Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s bottom. She sent\r\nher out when it was finished, and Lizzie joined us, weeping bitterly\r\nfrom the pain she was suffering. We laid her on the couch, and turned\r\nher petticoats over her head to cool her bottom, which she declared felt\r\nas if burning hot coals were spread over it. I kissed the dear red\r\nbuttocks that were all covered with weals and looked like raw beef, but\r\nno blood had been drawn. We fanned her with our handkerchiefs, which she\r\nsaid was a delightful relief. In a very few minutes she began to wriggle\r\nher bottom in a state of excitement, and cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Charlie, do shove your prick into my cunt, it has begun to long\r\nfor a fuck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wanted nothing but this to instantly act, for the sight of her bare\r\nbum had already made my cock stand as stiff as iron. She raised herself\r\non her hands and knees, presenting the back entrance to her cunt, and\r\ntelling me it was there she must have it instantly. I plunged up to the\r\nhilt in a moment, for she was as juicy and moist as if she had spent,\r\nwhich it is more than probable was the case. Very few powerful thrusts\r\non my part, seconded by energetic action on hers, and she spent again\r\nwith a scream of delight, and with a pressure on my cock that almost\r\nhurt it. She hardly paused a moment before she cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShove on, dear Charlie, push it in further if you can, I am burning\r\nwith desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wriggled her backside in every way in the most lascivious and\r\ndelicious manner, and when she felt the crisis approaching, by the\r\nincreased swelling and hardness of my prick as well as the peculiar\r\nelectric effect at the moment, she met my flood of sperm with so copious\r\na discharge that it literally spurted out and deluged my cods and\r\nthighs. She held me tight, and would not allow me to withdraw until I\r\nhad myself spent four times and she seven at least. We then rose, her\r\nnerves calmed by the repeated doses of hot boiling sperm shot into her\r\ninterior. She declared that never in all her fucking had she felt such\r\ninsatiable desire, or more ravishing delight in satisfying it, that she\r\nwould undergo a dozen such floggings to have the same rapturous\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit was all the effect of the rod, I never felt\r\nanything like it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary all this time had been but a spectator, and a pleased one to see\r\nthe erotic fury of her sister and my powerful efforts to allay it. It is\r\ntrue we had both had a delicious fuck during the time poor Lizzie was\r\ncatching it on her backside, and I had just gamahuched her deliciously\r\nafterwards as Lizzie came in in such pain.\r\n\r\nMiss Frankland had retired to her room, and looked still flushed and\r\nsomewhat wild looking when she joined us after the usual hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecreation. As may well be supposed, we were all as attentive as\r\npossible. There was one circumstance that evidently pleased Miss\r\nFrankland immensely. When Lizzie, in her turn, went up to repeat her\r\nlesson, she suddenly threw her arms round Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and\r\nwith tears running over her cheeks, sobbed out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Frankland, pray forgive me, and let me kiss you, for I love\r\nyou dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a bright sparkle of delight in Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. She\r\nclasped Lizzie round the waist, and drew her to her lips in a long sweet\r\nkiss of love, which seemed as if it would never end. We observed Miss\r\nFrankland\xe2\x80\x99s colour rise. She at last put Lizzie away, and said she was a\r\ndear amiable girl, whom she could not help loving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to your seat, you are too agitated, my dear, to say your lesson just\r\nnow; so send Mary up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLizzie came back to her seat, but I could not help fancying I saw a\r\ncomplete expression of erotic desire on her countenance. When afterwards\r\nwe were alone together, she told us that when the governess kissed her,\r\nshe felt Miss F.\xe2\x80\x99s tongue glide into her mouth, and \xe2\x80\x9ctip her the velvet\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin a most delicious and exciting manner, and she believed that if they\r\nhad been alone they must have given each other mutual embraces of a\r\nwarmer description. This led me to think that Miss Frankland was herself\r\nrendered lecherous by the action of even wielding the rod. Lizzie during\r\nthe whole of the next week did nothing but rave of the excessive\r\nexcitement that her whipping had put her into, and the extreme felicity\r\nshe felt in having her salacious lechery satisfied. We were not able to\r\nmeet every day, for frequently Miss Frankland accompanied us, and joined\r\nin the youthful sports we then gave way to. Lizzie continuing to harp on\r\nthe extraordinary enjoyment the whipping had procured her, after it was\r\nover, fired the imagination of Mary, until she was wound up to a pitch\r\nof actually longing to be whipped. In such a case it was easy to incur\r\nthe penalty; she had but wilfully to neglect her studies, and she was\r\nsure to get it. This she accordingly did, and it resulted as before.\r\nWhen released, she rushed to the summer house, and without any\r\npreliminaries, called upon me to fuck her directly; and a very similar\r\nscene followed to that which had occurred when dear Lizzie was whipped.\r\nMary did not, however, give way to the uncontrollable desire to throw\r\nherself into Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s arms as Lizzie had done. Miss F., as\r\nusual, retired to her room after the punishment was over, and was late\r\nin coming down, with the same flushed face and excited eye. I became\r\nconvinced that she herself was salaciously excited by the act, and I\r\nbegan to fancy that with such passions, if I could but excite her in any\r\nway, it might be worth my while. When once these lecherous ideas were\r\nraised in my imagination, desire soon painted her with every charm of\r\nbeauty, and I became excessively lewd and anxious to possess her. The\r\nmore I looked at and scanned the really beauteous proportions of her\r\nfinely developed form, the more my determination to have her took root,\r\nand grew strong within me.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Miss Frankland, who had become a great favourite with\r\nmamma, obtained permission to take possession of the spare bedroom, with\r\nan understanding that she was to cede it to any visitor who might come.\r\nOf course, this circumstance made my desire to get into her good graces\r\ndoubly strong, inasmuch as the opportunity of sleeping with her\r\nafterwards could be so easily effected. I determined to watch her when\r\nretiring to bed, and try to get a view of her naked form. For this\r\npurpose I removed the stopping of moistened bread I had put in the hole\r\nI made to see Mr. Benson fucking his wife. I lay awake, until she came\r\nto bed. I saw her undress, but only caught sight of her naked bubbies,\r\nover her chemise. As I have said, they were not large, but widely\r\nseparated, with a fine flat neck up to the throat. I mean that she\r\nshowed no collar bone, which is a great beauty in woman. She had\r\nevidently been quite naked, and had used the bidet, but the extent of\r\nthe slit in the door did not allow me to command the part of the room\r\nwhere she had used it. I remedied this defect next day, and the\r\nfollowing night was rewarded with a most glorious sight. You may well\r\nsuppose that I did not let sleep overcome me, but was at my post as soon\r\nas ever I heard her enter her room. I was on my knees in a moment, at my\r\npeephole, and saw her deliberately undress to her chemise. She then\r\narranged all her magnificent head of hair, brushing it out as far and\r\nfurther than her arms would extend; and after well brushing and combing\r\nit, she plaited and rolled it up, in a great big rouleau behind, then\r\nwashing her hands, she drew out the bidet, poured water into it, and\r\nthen divested herself of her shift. She was standing in front of the\r\ndressing-table, with two candles shining on her, so that when she lifted\r\nher shift over her head; I had a well-lighted full view of her\r\nwonderfully covered belly. She was all over hair; it was as black as\r\ncoal, and shone as if polished in all its beautiful curls. I am now an\r\nold man, but never have I seen the equal to that dear woman in a hairy\r\nbelly. It was quite up to her navel, and several inches down the inside\r\nof her thighs, besides running thickly in the chinks of her bottom, and\r\nwith two bunches where the beautiful back dimple is usually situated, as\r\nthick, and even thicker than ordinary women have in on their mounts. In\r\naddition to this, there was a beautiful little line of curls that ran up\r\nher belly, as far as between her bubbies, to say nothing of the very\r\nhairy thighs, legs, and arms. I never saw a more deliciously hairy\r\nwoman, and she was all that such excessive growth of hair\r\ndenoted\xe2\x80\x94passionate and lecherous to a degree, when once she had\r\nconfidence in her companion, to let her feelings have vent. Of course, I\r\nam now describing my after-experience; at the moment I was only dazzled\r\nby the extraordinary richness and quantity of that exquisite\r\nornament\xe2\x80\x94hair\xe2\x80\x94not only in splendid quantity on the head, but in a\r\nprofusion such as I had never then and have not since witnessed. I was\r\nstruck dumb with astonishment and admiration. She laved her hairy cunt,\r\nand all the adjacent parts, then wiped herself dry, put on her\r\nnightgown, extinguished her light, and, of course, got into bed. So did\r\nI but only to toss and tumble, and at last, in troubled sleep, to dream\r\nof that most gloriously covered cunt, and to imagine myself revelling\r\ntherein. So great was my excitement that I had the first wet dream I\r\never experienced. It is needless to say, it was under the dreaming idea\r\nthat I was enjoying to the utmost that wonder cunt.\r\n\r\nI was quite exhausted by morning with such a restless night, and was not\r\nonly very _distrait_, but was really so fatigued that I could not attend\r\nto my lessons. Of course Miss Frankland noticed this, and being unaware\r\nof the cause, attributed it to wilful idleness and bravado of her\r\nauthority. She spoke very gravely and seriously to me, and told me if I\r\ndid not improve my conduct by next day it would be her painful duty to\r\npunish me with severity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect to see you exhibit very different conduct tomorrow, otherwise\r\nyou will drive me to do that which I would much rather not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt rained hard that afternoon, and we had to amuse ourselves within\r\ndoors. On retiring for the night, I determined to watch again for Miss\r\nFrankland, but my want of rest the previous night overpowered me, and I\r\nfell fast asleep until far in the night. I rose and crept to my\r\npeephole, but all was dark. I could hear Miss Frankland breathing\r\nheavily. The thought at once struck me that I might safely steal up to\r\nmy sisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, as they were now alone, since Miss F. had the previous\r\nnight removed to the spare bedroom, where she was now fast asleep. So\r\nsoftly opening my door, and leaving it ajar, I crept along the passage,\r\ngained my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, and gently awakening them, jumped in between\r\nthem, to their great joy and satisfaction. We immediately began with a\r\ngamahuche, I taking Mary\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, while Lizzie crossed her legs over her\r\nhead, and was gamahuched by Mary, whose finger was at the same time\r\nacting _postilion_ to her charming bottom-hole, while I had the\r\nexquisite prospect before me of their operations. As soon as ever Mary\r\nspent I made Lizzie lie down on her back, with her head towards the\r\nbottom of the bed, Mary knelt over her in the opposite direction,\r\npresenting her very full backside, which was daily developing larger\r\nproportions. I plunged into her cunt, plugging her little rosy bum-hole\r\nat the same time with my middle finger, while Lizzie did as much for me,\r\nat the same time rubbing Mary\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris with the fleshy end of the\r\nthumb, while Mary, at the same time she herself was fucked and frigged\r\nin two places, was employed in gamahuching Lizzie, and frigging her\r\nbottom-hole with two fingers, Lizzie declaring that one finger felt as\r\nnothing. We lengthened out our delicious proceedings until excess of\r\nexcitement compelled us to give way to all the fury of our feelings, and\r\nwe managed to spend all together with such rapturous and lascivious\r\ndelight as rendered us quite powerless for some time. We then had a\r\ndelicious cuddle, the girls having each one hand on my prick and the\r\nother on my buttocks. When we had once more worked ourselves up to\r\nfucking heat, we reversed the previous position, and I fucked Lizzie.\r\nMary was gamahuched and bottom-fingered by Lizzie, while she employed\r\nherself with Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris and my bum-hole. Lizzie was far hotter\r\nand more salacious than any of us, and spent copiously on my delighted\r\nprick, which enjoyed excessively the warm bath of glutinous liquid that\r\nwas poured down upon it. I gave a few slow-drawn thrusts in and out, to\r\nmoisten well its whole shaft, and removing my two fingers from her\r\ndelicious bottom-hole, and wetting it with my saliva, I withdrew my\r\nprick from the reeking sheath of her cunt, and to her great delight\r\nslowly housed it in her longing and exquisitely delicious bottom-hole,\r\nkeeping it quiet there for some time, so as not to spend before Lizzie\r\nwas ready. I enjoyed the delicious throbbing of her body, which at last\r\nbecoming too exciting, I stooped over her, passed a hand under her\r\nbelly, replaced Mary\xe2\x80\x99s fingers, rubbing her clitoris while Mary frigged\r\nher cunt with two fingers thrust into it. We thus quickly brought\r\nmatters to an end, and died off in all the ecstasies of satiated lust.\r\nAs daylight was beginning to dawn, I tore myself from their loving\r\nembraces, gained my room in safety, and slept the sleep of the just\r\nuntil late in the morning.\r\n\r\nMy orgie with my sisters had so far satisfied my animal passions that I\r\nrather began to dread the severity I knew Miss Frankland would use if I\r\ncame under her hand. This made me so far attentive next day as to\r\nsatisfy her; and as it was a fine afternoon she came out to walk in the\r\ngarden, while we innocently amused ourselves. That evening I kept awake,\r\nand again enjoyed the superb display of Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s wonderfully\r\nhairy cunt, all the lower part of her body was as black as a chimney\r\nsweeper\xe2\x80\x99s. The sight awakened every lustful feeling within me. I felt I\r\nmust possess her, and determined to brave the severest infliction she\r\ncould give me with the rod. I somehow, instinctively, arrived at the\r\nconclusion that this extraordinary profusion of hair could only grow\r\nwhere nature had implanted the hottest animal passions, and had but to\r\ngreatly excite them to turn their lust to my advantage. I determined\r\nthat tomorrow I should bring things to a crisis, and that I might be\r\nequal to every effort I went to my bed, and did not attempt to steal up\r\nto my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 room. Next day nothing could be made of me in the\r\nmorning; Miss Frankland sternly warned me that if such conduct was\r\npursued after dinner nothing should save my skin from a severe\r\nscourging. However, my mind was made up, and I went in \xe2\x80\x9cfor the whole\r\nhog,\xe2\x80\x9d as our vulgar Yankee cousins say. I was more idle and\r\ninsubordinate than ever. Miss F. looked thunder; at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock she\r\nordered me to stay, and the girls to go. She then locked the door, took\r\nout from the desk a formidable rod, and told me to approach her. I did\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94really half in fear, for she could look dreadfully fierce and\r\ndetermined, in which case I came up to her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Charles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour conduct, for two or three days past, has\r\nbeen such as I cannot put up with. Your mother has given me full power\r\nto punish any of you severely, if I think you deserve it; you are\r\ngetting to be of an age that I hoped you would have so acted as to give\r\nme no cause of offence, but I am sorry to see my hopes are disappointed.\r\nI am now about to punish you, submit to it quietly, or it will be all\r\nthe worse for you. Unbutton and put down your trousers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt I must submit, but when brought to this point I really so much\r\ndreaded her that there was not the slightest erection in poor cockey.\r\n\r\nWhile I was undoing my trousers, I observed that Miss Frankland had\r\nquite lifted up her outer frock, and had sat down, evidently intending\r\nto flog me across her knee. Both being ready, she told me to put the\r\nfootstool by her side and kneel upon it, then desiring me to bend\r\nforward over her knees she put one hand over my body to hold me down;\r\nthen uncovering my bottom, and taking the rod, which was by her side,\r\nshe raised her arm and gave me a fearful cut, which made me not only\r\nflinch, but cry out most lustily. Blow followed blow, causing at first\r\ngreat agony, that made me cry again in good earnest; then the very\r\ncontinuance of the blows seemed to deaden the parts until I hardly felt\r\nthem. This was succeeded by a titillation and lascivious excitement\r\nwhich speedily brought my prick out in the fullest vigour. I then began\r\nto push it against Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s thigh, and to wriggle myself nearly\r\noff her knees. Seemingly to prevent this, she passed her left arm quite\r\nround my body, bringing her hand under my belly, and, apparently by\r\naccident, against my prick, which she grasped, and I could feel her hand\r\npass both up and down it as if she was measuring its length and\r\nthickness, continuing all the time to shower down blow after blow on my\r\ndevoted backside. As she held a firm grasp on my prick, I pretended to\r\nbe evading the blows, while in reality I was thrusting it in and out of\r\nher hand with the utmost energy and excitement, which speedily brought\r\non the delightful crisis, and with a cry of rapture I gave down a\r\ncopious discharge into her hand, and sank almost senseless on her lap. I\r\npretended complete loss of consciousness, which she believing, she\r\ngently felt, and even frigged a little, my prick, pressing me the while\r\nclose to her body, and then I felt a shudder run through her whole\r\nframe. I have no doubt she was in a paroxysm of lust, and had spent, I\r\ngave her time to recover a little, and then pretending to come to my\r\nsenses, but in a confused state of ideas, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what has happened? I have been in heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen raising myself, and apparently only just recognising Miss\r\nFrankland, I threw my arms round her neck, and exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Frankland, do flog me again if it will produce again such\r\necstasies as I never before experienced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face was flushed, her eye shone with all the fire of libidinous\r\npassion. My prick had hardly lost its stiffness when I spent, and was\r\nnow projecting out firmer than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Charles, I thought you a mere boy, while you are quite a man with\r\nsuch a thing as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdo continue to hold it, you give me such pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone else ever held it in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never felt anything like it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you know what this is meant to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, it is what I piddle from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and asked if it was often in its present state of\r\nstiffness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery morning when I awake it is so, and it hurts me very much until I\r\npiddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has no one ever taught you any other use of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, what use can it be of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dear innocent boy, if I could trust you, I would teach you a secret\r\nthat this dear thing would greatly enjoy. But can I trust you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly, dear Miss Frankland, I know what you mean now, to repeat\r\nthe delicious sensations you gave me a few minutes ago. Oh, do, do! do\r\nit again, it was far too nice for me ever to tell anybody, as long as\r\nyou will do it for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Charles, I will trust you. Do you know that women are differently\r\nformed from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I used to sleep in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s room, and I have often been surprised\r\nto see that she piddled from a long hole, and had not got a doodle like\r\nI have to piddle from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear innocent Charlie, that long hole was made to take in this dear\r\nfellow here that is throbbing almost to bursting in my hand, and if you\r\npromise me faithfully never to tell anyone, I will teach you how it is\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou may be sure my protestations of secrecy were most earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here then, my dear boy, and see what I have got between my legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid herself back on the long chair, drew up her petticoats, and\r\nexhibited to my charmed gaze the wondrous wealth of hair she possessed.\r\nOpening her legs, I saw the wide-spread rosy lips showing themselves in\r\nbeautiful contrast to the coal-black hair that grew in the greatest\r\nprofusion all round the lower lips, and extended also some five or six\r\ninches down the side of each thigh. But what at the moment most\r\nastonished me, and drew all my attention, was to see a deep red clitoris\r\nstanding out from the upper part of her cunt quite stiff, and as long\r\nand as thick as the middle finger of a man. I very nearly betrayed\r\nmyself at the sight, but, fortunately, was able to keep up the character\r\nof apparent ignorance I had hitherto shown, and said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou, also, have\r\ngot a little doodle to piddle with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very different from yours. Give me yours here, that I may kiss\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fondled it for a second or two, and then could not resist the\r\nimpulse to take it into her mouth and suck it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what pleasure! I shall die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, dear boy; kneel down there, and I shall instruct you in the\r\nreal secret of pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, before she could do anything, I threw my head down, crying out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must give this pretty little fellow a taste of the pleasure you have\r\njust given mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in an instant I had the delicious thing up to the root in my mouth,\r\nsucking furiously at it. Her twistings, and up and down action of her\r\nloins, showed how rapturously I was exciting her, in fact, I brought on\r\nthe crisis, when she pressed my head down hard upon it, and closed her\r\nthighs on each side of my head, as she poured over my chin and breast a\r\nperfect torrent of sperm. A minute after she seized my arms, and drew me\r\nup on her belly, then slipping her hand down between us, she seized my\r\nprick and guided him, nothing loath, into her burning hot and foaming\r\ncunt. She placed her hands on my buttocks, and pressing me right up to\r\nthe hilt, began a movement which she told me how to second, that in a\r\nvery short time brought down an exquisite spend from me. The idea that\r\nshe was giving me the first lesson in love, and of being the first\r\npossessor of my person, seemed to excite her lust to the utmost, and she\r\nimmediately followed my discharge with another, so copious that it\r\nspurted all over my thighs. Her force of pressure on my prick in her\r\nagonies of enjoyment was so great as nearly to hurt me. I never knew\r\nanyone but her with such strength of pressure of cunt on the prick. She\r\nhas often actually brought tears into my eyes, so powerful was her grip\r\nthat it made me really feel as if in a vice. She lay back with closed\r\neyes and panting bosom in a rapturous trance of lascivious lubricity,\r\nher throbbing cunt holding me tightly pressed between its palpitating\r\nfolds in the most delicious imprisonment, and from time to time grasping\r\nmy prick with a pressure that very shortly restored it to its fullest\r\nvigour and stiffness. She was as hot as fire and responded immediately\r\nto the renewed life she found stirring within me. She gave way to her\r\nsalacious lust with, if anything, a more passionate excess than the\r\nfirst time. My superb weapon seemed to stir up within her a force of\r\nlubricity that nothing could seem to satisfy. Her hands clutched my\r\nbuttocks convulsively, and seemed to wish to force my whole body into\r\nher wildly excited cunt. With such vigour was the action carried on that\r\nthe grand crisis soon arrived, most rapturous to both, and almost\r\nmaddening to Miss Frankland. The heavings of her body and gaspings for\r\nbreath were quite hysterical, while, with one of those real vice-like\r\npressures, I felt as if she were nipping my prick in two. It was not a\r\nmere throbbing pressure, but a long continued convulsive squeeze, as if\r\nher cunt had been seized like the jaws of the mouth with lock-jaw, and\r\ncould not open. It was nearly ten minutes before she recovered her\r\nsenses. She seized my head between her hands, kissed me most lovingly,\r\ndeclared I was the dearest creature that ever lived, that she had never\r\nbefore had anyone who had so satisfied her, and filled her with\r\ninexpressible rapture, &amp;c. This fondling had again brought up my prick\r\nto full stand. Miss Frankland said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Charlie, we must be prudent, as the time is drawing near for your\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x99 return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there was no stopping, the exquisite pleasure of her splendid\r\ninterior cunt pressures was irresistible. My movements speedily\r\ndetermined matters in my favour. Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s temperament was far\r\ntoo warm not to quickly set her passions to the highest fucking heat;\r\nand again we had a most exquisite fuck, lengthened out more luxuriously\r\nby the more urgent fires of desire having been moderated by the three\r\nprevious discharges. With more abandon we both sank in the death-like\r\necstasies of the delicious melting away in all the luxury of contented\r\nand voluptuous discharges. Miss Frankland lay for some short time\r\nluxuriously closing in my delighted prick, but raising her body, she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharles, we must cease for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, pushing me away, I was forced to withdraw; but her dear cunt seemed\r\nas reluctant as myself, and held my prick so tight that I had to pull\r\nhard to draw it out, and, at last, he left with a noise like drawing a\r\ncork from a well-corked bottle. Before I rose, or she could hinder me, I\r\nthrew myself down and glued my lips to her reeking cunt, and greedily\r\nlicked up the foaming sperm that had surged out of her well-gorged quim.\r\nShe with difficulty drew away her body, but as I rose she clasped me to\r\nher bosom and kissed me most fervently, and licked her own sperm off my\r\nrichly covered lips. Begging me to button up, and putting herself to\r\nrights, she desired me to sit down by her side. She wiped my mouth with\r\nher handkerchief, arranged my disordered neck-tie, collar, and hair. We\r\nthen embraced most tenderly, and she thanked me for the immense\r\ngratification I had given her; she praised my parts as being of\r\nextraordinary development and more satisfying than any she had yet had\r\nany experience of. This was the second time she referred to other\r\nexperiences. I took no notice of this all the time, as if I was supposed\r\nto be too ignorant or innocent to think any harm of it, but I determined\r\nin some excess of passion to get her to give me a recital of some of her\r\nprevious experiences.\r\n\r\nBefore my sisters came in, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall try and arrange some means for our meeting unobserved tomorrow.\r\nMeanwhile, you must sit as if you had been severely punished, and I\r\nshall assert that you had done everything to resist my authority, for\r\nwhich I had punished you further by not allowing you to leave the\r\nschoolroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said not a word to Miss F. about the ease of meeting by merely opening\r\nthe door of communication between our rooms. I was afraid to make her\r\nsuspicious of a former use of it. But I determined, when she came to\r\nbed, to rap at the door and beg her to open it, and I had no doubt she\r\nwould be as delighted as myself to find with what facility she could\r\nindulge to the utmost every libidinous passion which her lascivious\r\nnature could suggest. My sisters returned, and appeared disappointed\r\nthat I had not been able to join them, as they had anticipated a\r\nglorious fuck or two each, after the whipping had excited me as it did\r\nthem. They told me afterwards they had been obliged to content\r\nthemselves with a double mutual gamahuche, but it did not make up for my\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nWhile they were all engaged after tea, I slipped up to Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom to see that the key was in the lock of the door between our two\r\nrooms. I opened it, oiled the hinges, and locked it again from her side.\r\nI also, with a view to sometimes slipping up to my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, oiled\r\nmy own and their doors, hinges, and locks, as now that the ice was\r\nbroken with Miss Frankland, it would be necessary to be doubly careful\r\nnot to excite suspicion of my visits to my sisters. Having finished\r\neverything to my satisfaction, I joined them in the drawing room, and\r\nwhile my sisters were playing duets on the piano to mamma, I challenged\r\nMiss Frankland to a game of chess. She, of course, was a far superior\r\nplayer to me, but our legs meeting under the chess table, her little\r\ncharming foot sought mine, rested on it, and pressed it from time to\r\ntime. This distraction of her ideas enabled me to win two games\r\nsuccessively. My mother sent the girls to bed, and told me to follow\r\ntheir example, but as I did not wish to lie long waiting for Miss\r\nFrankland\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in her bedroom, I pleaded for relaxation in the\r\nhour of retiring, to enable Miss Frankland to regain her chance of\r\nbeating me, at the same time pressing her foot as a sign to her to\r\nsecond my request. She took the hint, though she had no idea of the\r\nobject. Mamma came near us to look over our game. This induced Miss\r\nFrankland to play with more caution and thought, and she won three games\r\nin succession, making her the final winner. Mamma now said I must go to\r\nbed, as it was very late for me. She still treated me as a child. I,\r\nhowever, had gained my object in obtaining nearly two hours\xe2\x80\x99 delay in\r\ngoing to bed, so that I had not long to wait before I heard Miss\r\nFrankland enter her room. I determined to let her finish her toilet\r\nbefore I called her attention to me. I watched through my peephole, and\r\ncould now calmly and leisurely see all the beauties of her\r\nwell-developed form, and the rich wealth of hair she possessed. She went\r\nthrough all her ablutions as usual. I observed she also used a syringe\r\nto thoroughly purify the inside of her glorious cunt. When she had dried\r\nherself, and was about to pull on her chemise, I rapped on the door of\r\ncommunication, and in a loud whisper called her attention to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you there, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pray unlock the door and open it, that I may come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe actually had not yet discovered that the door, locked and bolted on\r\nher side, communicated with my bedroom, but her delight at the discovery\r\nwas greater than her surprise. I flew into her arms, and was hugged to\r\nher bosom, and covered with kisses. But as my prick was in a bursting\r\nstate of erection, I drew her to the bed, upon which we both threw\r\nourselves, she on her back, and I above, and in an instant I was\r\nengulphed up to the cods in her glorious and glowing cunt, and we ran an\r\neager course of rapturous thrustings, until nature could stand no more,\r\nand we sank in all the delights of a most delicious mutual spend. I lay\r\nsoaking in bliss for some time, and after fondling each other, Miss\r\nFrankland said\xe2\x80\x94,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, dear Charlie, and let us get into bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor we had been in too great haste to do otherwise than tumble on the\r\ntop to it. My charming bedfellow also rose for a necessary purpose,\r\nwhich I had interrupted when I knocked at the door. She sat down on the\r\n_pot de chambre_, and a mighty rush of water followed. I cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do let me see you piddle from your beautiful fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI still kept up my character of innocence, and used none but infantine\r\nwords in reference to our organs of generation.\r\n\r\nShe laughed, but pulled up her shift, and raised her thighs above the\r\npot, so advancing the light, I had the delicious sight of her\r\nwide-stretched cunt, pouring out a stream of piddle with great force.\r\nHer position brought out all the beauties of the vast wide-spread mass\r\nof black curly hair that thickly covered all the lower part of her\r\nmagnificent quim, ran down each thigh, up between her buttocks, and\r\nopening out on her back, had two bunches just below the two beautiful\r\ndimples that were so charmingly developed below her waist. There was as\r\nmuch hair there as most women have on their mons Veneris. Her whole body\r\nhad fine straight silky hair on it, very thick on the shoulders, arms\r\nand legs, with a beautiful creamy skin showing below. She was the\r\nhairiest woman I ever saw, which, doubtless, arose from or was the cause\r\nof her extraordinary lustful and luxurious temperament. The sight I was\r\nindulging in brought out my pego in full bloom; as we both rose she saw\r\nit sticking out under my shirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff with all that, and let me gaze on your charming young perfections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as she desired, begged her to do the same, and there she stood, in\r\nall the glory of her superb form. We encircled each other\xe2\x80\x99s naked\r\nbodies, and then turned each other round to gaze on all the exciting\r\ncharms displayed to each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my darling boy, and let me kiss and fondle you all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid me on my back, reversed herself above me, and taking my prick\r\nin her mouth, after first feeling it most gently, and praising its large\r\nproportions, again declaring it was the finest she had ever seen, she\r\nbegan to gamahuche me with a skill such as I had never before\r\nexperienced, and gave me the most exquisite and most luxurious delight.\r\nFor my part, seeing her wonderful clitoris, stiff standing out of the\r\nbright red lips of her luscious cunt, I took it bodily into my mouth,\r\nsucked it, and rolled my tongue about it, to the evident delight of my\r\nsalacious companion. Her buttocks rose and fell, and the lips of her\r\ncunt immediately before my eyes opened, or closely pressed the lips\r\ntogether, showing the delicious nature of her enjoyment. I felt her put\r\nher hand to my bottom and insert her finger, and begin frigging me\r\nthere. I let her see how it pleased me. She stopped a moment, to beg me\r\nto do the same to her, anticipating my earnest desire to do so. I lost\r\nno time in following her example. The parts adjacent were well\r\nlubricated by our previous indulgence, and first inserting two fingers\r\ninto her deliciously juicy cunt to moisten them, I slipped one of them\r\ninto her charming bottom-hole, and finding great ease of space, slipped\r\nthe second in as well. My other hand and arm embraced and caressed her\r\nmagnificent backside, which rose and fell on my face with unwearied\r\nspeed, as my finger frigged her bottom-hole in unison with her\r\nmovements, and my mouth more closely sucked her stiffly excited\r\nclitoris.\r\n\r\nHer whole body became convulsed with erotic movements, showing what\r\nforce of lubricity our mutual embracings were most rapturously exciting.\r\nI, too, grew wild with desire, and was equally energetic in my\r\nmovements, and would have thrust my prick down her throat but for her\r\nhand, which grasped the lower part of the shaft. The rapturous crisis\r\ncame at last and laid us prostrate with soul-killing ecstasies. We each\r\nretained the dear object of our mutual caresses within our lips and our\r\nfingers remained within the delightful recesses that had so much\r\ncontributed to the excessive raptures we had enjoyed. We lay for some\r\ntime in this sweet languid enjoyment. Miss Frankland then rose from off\r\nme, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling boy, we must now get into bed.\xe2\x80\x9d We did so, quite naked as we\r\nwere, closely embracing, and covering each other with kisses and\r\ncaresses, murmuring soft terms of endearment, and in whispered accents\r\ntold of the ecstatic joys each had given the other. Our hands wandered\r\nover every charm. Miss Frankland had an art of gently passing her\r\nfingers over my prick that had the instant effect of raising him into\r\nthe fullest vigour. It was the most exquisite method of feeling my cock\r\nI ever experienced. She seemed scarcely to touch it, but drew her\r\nfingers along its length, from foot to head, with a delicacy of touch I\r\nhave never found equalled by any other woman. The effect was magical,\r\nand invariable, no matter how many times I might have fucked her before.\r\nWith her hot temperament, and excessive lubricity, it was almost a\r\nnecessary art. She was one of those libidinous natures that could well\r\nemploy several men at once. At my happy age, she found ready to her hand\r\none who could respond to her every desire in every way, so happily does\r\nnature second youth and health that she never found me wanting, when\r\ncalled on. There was no excess of lubricity we did not afterwards\r\npractise. We satisfied our passions in every way in which they could be\r\nindulged, nor did we hesitate at anything which imagination could fancy\r\nwould stimulate them. She was surprised at my aptitude, and rejoiced and\r\ncongratulated herself on having found so powerful and charming a\r\nsatisfier of her libidinous nature. How delighted she was to think she\r\nwas the first to cull the sweets of my innocence, and how happy to find\r\nso apt a scholar, who in one sweet lesson became a master of the art.\r\nThe more I gained experience of the charming sex, the more I appreciated\r\nthe wisdom of the counsels of my really first and ever loved mistress,\r\ndear, charming, lovely Mrs. Benson. How truly she had foretold that all\r\nwho might hereafter think that they were giving me the first lesson in\r\nlove would doubly, trebly, a hundred fold enjoy the sweet intercourse\r\nfrom such self-deception. Here was my fiery Miss Frankland, who had had\r\nconsiderable experience in the amatory world, pluming herself upon\r\ninstructing an innocent youth in all the mysteries of the passions for\r\nthe first time. It evidently added immensely to her excitement. Indeed,\r\nin our after-conversation, she avowed that as it was the first time she\r\nhad ever taken the maidenhead of a youth, so it had been the greatest\r\ndegree of excitement she had ever experienced. I might fancy her delight\r\nat finding combined with such a satisfaction a wonderfully well hung\r\nyouth, and who proved so apt, and so equal to every luxurious whim that\r\nthe most erotic lust could suggest. But I digress. At present, her magic\r\ntouch had brought me up to bursting point, she threw a leg over me, and\r\nraising her body, said she would help herself this time. Guiding my\r\nprick to the wanton lips that were longing for him, she sank slowly down\r\non the stiff pole on which she was so delightedly impaling herself,\r\nuntil our hairs were crushed beneath her weight, and nothing more could\r\nbe engulphed. She again rose, until the edge of the nut showed itself at\r\nthe mouth of her cunt, and then as slowly sheathed it again. She\r\ncontinued this exquisite movement for some time, to our delicious mutual\r\nenjoyment, then falling down on my belly, and telling me to pass my arm\r\nround her bottom and finger her as before, she glued herself to my lips,\r\nour tongues interlaced, and shot in and out of our luxurious mouths; our\r\nmovement grew fast and furious, until we again sank in all the luxury of\r\nthe last grand crisis. It was the very act of voluptuous rapture, and we\r\nlay lost to every sense but that of erotic ecstasy and satisfied lust.\r\nWhen we recovered our senses, she lay down by my side, cuddling me most\r\nclosely, and toying and prattling, until she thought we had paused long\r\nenough. She slid her hand down to my prick, and very quickly, by her\r\ndelicious and delicate handling of it, renewed its full vigour. Throwing\r\nher right leg over me, while lying on her back, she heaved up her body\r\ninto a position half turned to my belly, I lying on my side; she then\r\nbid me embrace her other thigh between mine, then guiding cockey to the\r\nentrance, she gave a push backwards, to meet my forward thrust, when it\r\nwas instantly sheathed to the hilt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my darling boy, in this way we can lengthen out our pleasures as\r\nlong as we please; you can make me spend oftener than yourself, which\r\nwill satisfy my very lustful nature, and not over exhaust your young\r\npowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiving one or two delicious side wriggles to her bottom, and nestling\r\nher backside close to my belly, she told me to pass my left arm under\r\nher waist that I might embrace her left bubby and finger its nipple,\r\na proceeding which she told me was as exciting as playing with her\r\nclitoris\xe2\x80\x94then turning her head, our tongues interlaced; she put my\r\nright hand down to her stiff-projecting clitoris, which I continued\r\nto frig just as I might have done to a boy\xe2\x80\x99s cock. Keeping up a slow\r\nin and out movement with my prick, excited by so many points of\r\nlascivious friction, she spent most copiously before I was prepared to\r\njoin her. Her head sank back in the ecstasy of her discharge, drawing\r\naway from me, and leaving my mouth free. I instantly dropped it upon\r\nher other firm and elastic bubby, at which I sucked away, pushing my\r\nprick as far as possible into her cunt, and leaving it there, without\r\nmovement, to enjoy the rapture-giving pressures of her delicious cunt,\r\nslowly passing my hand up and down her still sufficiently indurated\r\nclitoris. She lay for some time in the luxurious enjoyment of the\r\nposition, then once more sucking my lips, she thanked me over and\r\nover again for the pleasure I had given her, heightened as it was by\r\nknowing that it had not exhausted me. I began to move slowly in and\r\nout, keeping up my movements at the other points of excitement. She\r\nwas ready on the instant to second me, and as she meant this time that\r\nwe should spend together she left nothing to desire. Her movements\r\nwere of the most exciting and stimulating description, and we were not\r\nlong before the ecstatic moment arrived, and we sank in the lap of\r\nluxury, pouring forth streams of ecstatic bliss. We lay close locked\r\nin the most delicious embrace, only conscious of unutterable joy. It\r\nwas some time before we could venture to break this exquisite trance\r\nof enjoyment. It was followed by the sweetest toyings and prattlings,\r\nuntil again my delighted prick, stimulated by the internal pressures\r\nof the luxurious sheath in which it had remained engulphed, again\r\nawoke her scarce-slumbering passions to dash on pleasure\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly\r\ncourse. Again she spent before me with, if anything, increased rapture,\r\nand, after a pause, renewing her lascivious movements in response to\r\nmy own, we sank in a perfect death-like swoon of thoroughly satiated\r\nlust, and gradually and imperceptibly fell into the deepest slumber for\r\nmany hours, locked as we were in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. Her wonderfully\r\nretentive power of cunt held my happy prick a willing prisoner through\r\nour long sleep. I awoke first, to find it standing stiff within the\r\ncharmed circle which even in her sleep was deliciously grasping it\r\nwith its nervous folds. I passed my hand down to her clitoris, and\r\nbegan fucking her. She heaved her bottom up and down, and murmured some\r\nincoherent words, being evidently still under the influence of sleep,\r\nand probably dreaming of some former events, for in her half expressed\r\nmurmurings, I could make out something\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry\xe2\x80\x94my only\xe2\x80\x94ever loved one\xe2\x80\x94meet again\xe2\x80\x94oh! how ineffable\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nexquisitely delicious. Do push it in\xe2\x80\x94more faster\xe2\x80\x94beloved of my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped me with a hug, as if she would make but one body of us both,\r\nand spent with a scream of agonized delight, pouring down and spurting\r\nout a perfect torrent of boiling spunk all over my cods and thighs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest, beloved Henry, it is too much,\xe2\x80\x9d she uttered, and fainted away.\r\n\r\nI lay quite still, and determined not to speak until she should come to\r\nherself. It was evident her dreams had brought back some former loved\r\nand happy man and no doubt the fact of my being in possession, in full\r\nfuck, had made her believe in the reality of her sleeping thoughts. She\r\nwas quite a quarter of an hour before recovering her senses; daylight\r\nhad broken, and she looked round in a sort of alarm, and exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen her eye catching my face\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my darling Charlie, it is you! I have been dreaming of being far\r\naway, and, I suppose, the fact of your dear weapon throbbing within me\r\nmade me think of former events. Well, the dream had its pleasures, if\r\nonly in a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was no dream, my dear Miss Frankland, or at least, only partially\r\nso, as far as regarded your loved Henry\xe2\x80\x94for that was the name you\r\napplied to me, and most deliciously did you embrace me under the idea,\r\nand die away in an excess of pleasure I quite envied; but you alarmed me\r\nby really fainting afterwards. I am so pleased to have turned a mere\r\nvision of the night into ecstatic reality, and I am not at all jealous\r\nof your former lover, because had you not had any, you would, probably,\r\nnever have loved me. Oh, no! I should never be jealous of you my dear\r\nmistress. I would even like to see you in all the ecstasies of passion,\r\nin the arms of another, provided that I should share in your delights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe listened in an astonishment, acknowledged that she had imagined\r\nherself in the arms of one she had greatly loved, and had thought the\r\nwhole affair was a dream, and was not conscious of its absolute reality\r\nas to her being fucked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must have mine now, feel how it is bursting for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, the dear fellow, push him away, my Charlie, and you will see,\r\nI shall enjoy the real Charlie quite as much as the dreamt-of Henry\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nwhom I shall some day speak to you. You are worthy of him and of me\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI fear I shall love you as I do him, far too dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen lending herself to the work we were at, she did, indeed, exert all\r\nher lascivious power, and we enjoyed such a fuck as seldom falls to\r\nmortals here below. We lay prostrate and panting with satisfied lust,\r\nuntil prompted by the urgency of natural wants we were both obliged to\r\nrise and relieve ourselves. My darling mistress then used her bidet and\r\ntold me to lave my parts in the basin, as it was not only cool and\r\nrefreshing, but also reinvigorating. After which as it was now broad\r\ndaylight, she allowed me to pose her, and turn her in every position,\r\nthat I might admire and handle every part of her superb form. Her bottom\r\nwas larger and harder than any I had yet seen, and, indeed, excepting\r\none, of which, dear reader you will presently hear something, it was\r\nabout the finest in form and size of any I ever met with. Of course,\r\nthis handling was not effected without producing erotic excitement in\r\nboth parties. Miss Frankland had occupied herself as much with me as I\r\nhad done with her, and her beautifully large clitoris was showing its\r\nhead in full stand out from among the vast mass of bushy curls\r\nsurrounding it. I proposed we should have a mutual suck on the floor,\r\nwith her bottom to the light, that I might have a full view of all her\r\nglorious parts. She humoured my fancy, and pulling a couple of pillows\r\noff the bed to prop up my head, she stepped across my body, and kneeling\r\ndown, took my prick in her mouth, and brought her splendid backside and\r\nlascivious cunt down to my face. I first glued my lips to the open cunt,\r\nthrust my chin in, and then my tongue, as far as I could reach, licking\r\nthe luscious moisture which our previous handlings had excited; it was\r\nas sweet and delicious as cream. This stimulated her very much, and she\r\nclosed the sides of her cunt upon my tongue so closely as to give it a\r\ngood squeeze. I never saw a woman but her, who had such a wonderful\r\npower in that way. My nose actually felt it was reciprocating the\r\npressures of the cunt, so I changed the venue, and slipped my tongue\r\ninto her bottom-hole, evidently to her excessive delight. But things\r\nwere approaching a crisis, and she cried to me to take her clitoris in\r\nmy mouth, and substitute fingers in both the other orifices. This I\r\nquickly did, while she sucked and postillioned me, handling the root of\r\nmy prick, and my buttocks with the delicious gentle titillations in\r\nwhich she had such skill, until, in an excess of joy, we both poured a\r\ntribute of sperm into each other\xe2\x80\x99s mouths, and both greedily swallowed\r\nit. After this we got into bed again, to have one loving cuddle before\r\nparting. Of course, it ended in raising such a storm of desire as a fuck\r\ncould only allay\xe2\x80\x94she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy loved Charlie, this must really be the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told her it had so excited me to see her splendid bum before my eyes\r\nwhen we were on the floor that I should like to kneel behind and put it\r\nin that way. I really meant into her cunt, but she thought I meant her\r\nbottom-hole, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are a strange boy, what on earth made you think you could put\r\nthat great big thing of yours into my bottom-hole; but, to tell you the\r\ntruth, after being well fucked, I rather like it that way, so you shall\r\ntry, but you must be gentle in getting in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know I could do it that way with my prick, I meant to\r\nput it into your cunt from behind, but now, from what you say, I should\r\nlike to try what the other is like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou see, I was keeping up my apparent ignorance. She turned on her face,\r\nand keeping her head on the pillow, drew up her knees to her belly and\r\nexposed to the greatest advantage her glorious backside. I knelt behind,\r\nbut previous to beginning, I glued my lips to the delicious orifice, and\r\nshoved my tongue in as far as I could, and deliriously excited her. Then\r\napproaching my stiff-standing prick, and thrusting it into her cunt up\r\nto the roots two or three times, so as thoroughly to lubricate it, I\r\nwithdrew and placed it before the smaller temple of lust; then, by a\r\ngentle uniform pressure, I gradually and almost imperceptibly glided in\r\nto the utmost extent. She pushed her bottom out, and, I could feel, was\r\nstraining as if to void something, which is the real method to\r\naccelerate the entrance of a prick in that enchanting channel with the\r\nleast difficulty and pain. We then commenced a slow movement\xe2\x80\x94she wanted\r\nme to stoop forward and place my arm round her body, and frig her\r\nclitoris, but I begged her to do it herself, and allow me the luxury of\r\nlooking on the delightful wriggling of her superb backside, and also the\r\nsight of my own prick surging in and then withdrawing. She humoured me,\r\nand we had a most exquisite fuck. Her bottom-hole had hardly so tight a\r\npressure as she could exercise with her cunt, but, nevertheless, it held\r\nme in very firmly, and had a peculiar heat which was most exciting. We\r\nboth died off together, she so completely overcome with ecstatic delight\r\nthat her body sank flat on the bed, drawing me with her, without\r\nunsheathing my weapon. We lay for a short period, she convulsively\r\nshuddering from time to time with the intense degree of excitement this\r\ndelicious route had produced upon her. At last she begged me to rise and\r\nrelieve her. As we must now separate, I rose. She assisted me in my\r\nablutions, put on my nightshirt, conducted me to my bed, fondly kissed\r\nand thanked me for the exquisite night of every species of delight I had\r\nconferred upon her, promising a repetition the following night. She left\r\nme and locked the door of communication, but previously unlocked mine,\r\nin case I should oversleep myself.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first delightful night I ever passed with that most\r\ncharming and deliciously lascivious woman\xe2\x80\x94the first of many scores that\r\nfollowed, but in none of which were her raptures more intense, if as\r\nmuch. She ever after dwelt on the night when she had been the happy\r\nmeans of initiating me into all love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries, for she never knew of\r\nmy previous experiences, and always plumed and prided herself on being\r\nmy first instructress.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was somewhat somnolent, of which you may be sure Miss\r\nFrankland took no notice. She retired to her own room when we went for\r\nour recreation. My sisters scolded me for not coming to them the\r\nprevious night, but I told them that Miss F. had continued to move about\r\nher room for so long a time that I had fallen fast asleep, and even then\r\nhad not had enough, as they might have observed how sleepy I had been\r\nall day. However, to satisfy them, I gamahuched them both, and fucked\r\nthem both while each was giving the other a second gamahuche, so that\r\nthen each spent three times to my twice. I thus kept in my forces for\r\nthe renewed delights I anticipated at night. I went to bed early and\r\nslept soundly at once, having no anxiety about keeping awake, feeling\r\ncertain that Miss F. would awaken me as soon as she was ready to take me\r\nto her arms. She came, and we passed another most delicious night of\r\nevery salacious and libidinous enjoyment. A third night followed, which\r\ndiffered only in the lascivious proposition of Miss Frankland to\r\ndeflower my bottom-hole with her wonderfully prominent and elongated\r\nclitoris, little dreaming that there, too, she had been anticipated by\r\nour loved and charming friend MacCallum. She had, however, all the\r\nimaginary pleasure of first possession. As you may well suppose, I did\r\nnot attempt in any way to enlighten her ignorance thereon. We had\r\ngamahuched each other, I had fucked her twice in the cunt and once in\r\nher bottom-hole, when the fancy seized her to bugger me with her\r\nclitoris. Of course, I made no objection; on the contrary, sucking it up\r\nto a proper stiffness, I placed myself on my hands and knees in the most\r\nfavourable position to satisfy her erotic fancy. She first slipped her\r\ntongue into my bottom-hole, then spit upon her clitoris, and then\r\nanointed my aperture with the delicious slime of her well-fucked cunt,\r\nand then with the utmost ease pushed the dear thing up to its utmost\r\nlimits. I humoured her in every way, wriggling my bottom sideways, which\r\nshe declared was a vast improvement on her back and forward movements.\r\nShe passed her arm round my belly, and with that exquisitely delightful\r\ntouch on my prick for which she was so distinguished, she excited me to\r\nthe utmost, making my _sphincter ani_ respond to the throbbings of my\r\nexquisitely delighted prick, and equally exciting her lascivious\r\npassions with the idea of first possession of that narrow abode of\r\nvoluptuousness. She could feel by the electric excitement of my prick\r\nhow near I was to spending, and quickening the action of hand and\r\nclitoris, we both died away together in all the raptures that such an\r\nextra exciting conjunction could produce.\r\n\r\nSeveral nights thus passed in the indulgence of every form of the most\r\nlascivious enjoyment. We used to amuse our moments of relaxation in\r\ntrying who could suggest any new position or varied manner of effecting\r\nthe delicious junction of our bodies. On one occasion, recurring to the\r\nstate of excitement her flogging had thrown me into, I asked her, as if\r\nI did not know the fact very well already, if the application of the rod\r\non the bottom of a woman, or the mere act of being flogged, at all\r\nexcited her sex. She told me both acted with great force on her erotic\r\nnerves. She thought, from experience, that being whipped caused the\r\ngreatest excitement and produced the greatest longing to be fucked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think it had erotically excited my sisters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, especially your sister Eliza. I do not know whether you\r\nnoticed her sudden impulse to embrace and kiss me after her return to\r\nschoolwork the day I flogged her; that was a stray erotic impulse, and\r\nhad we been alone, I could not have avoided responding to it in a way\r\nthat would have delighted her, and initiated her into some of the\r\ndelicious mysteries of venery. Nay, I think, but for my happy discovery\r\nof your great and delightful merits, I should have sought for and found\r\nan opportunity of being alone with that dear girl, for you must know we\r\ncan lasciviously embrace our own sex with immense mutual pleasure, and\r\nalthough not equal to that which this noble fellow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(taking hold of my\r\nprick)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinspires, is not without its merit, and even as a little variety\r\nfrom time to time is very enticing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I suppose, you still have some hankerings after the virgin charms\r\nof dear Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, and what is more, I believe both Mary\xe2\x80\x99s and her passions have\r\nalready developed themselves. I have sometimes fancied I heard\r\nsuppressed sighs and gentle movements going on in their beds, and I\r\nshrewdly suspect they were practising masturbation on each other. I did\r\nnot interfere, and after what has passed between you and me, I will tell\r\nyou that I had a little plan in my head to let them proceed to such\r\nlengths that when I chose to make the discovery they would be at my\r\nmercy. I then could initiate them in every lascivious and voluptuous\r\ndelight that woman can have with woman. The happy discovery of your\r\nexcellences, and the perfect facility my change of room has given for\r\nmeeting without the slightest chance of discovery, has for the present\r\ndriven that idea out of my head. I am, however, indebted to it for the\r\nchange of room, as I asked for it solely to leave the two girls the\r\nutmost liberty to indulge in their voluptuous mutual enjoyments, certain\r\nthat it would increase and give them every desire for the further\r\ninstruction I could impart to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you would have fucked them with this dear stiff little\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you darling, but you have so excited me talking about it, that\r\nyou must fuck me directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe indulged in a most exciting fuck, and when recovered from the\r\nconfusion of ideas the delightful crisis always produces, we resumed our\r\nconversation on the interesting subject of my sisters. I observed that\r\nshe had not lately flogged them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll your fault; I am now so satisfied with you that I no longer seek\r\nfor relief to pent-up desires in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, dear Miss Frankland, did flogging my sisters excite you much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did, even to spending; but the fear of proceeding further with them\r\nat that time rendered me ferocious. The very severity I used was as it\r\nwere in revenge for stopping short of other salacious embraces, but if\r\nonce I had gone so far as to make them partakers of my lubricity, I\r\nshould never have flogged them again so severely, but only to such a\r\ngentle extent as would raise their passions to an uncomfortable pitch,\r\nrendering them slaves to my burning lust. Even now I have, from time to\r\ntime, a desire to do so, especially with dear Eliza, as I think she had\r\nfar more of venereal lust in her nature than Mary. You would not object,\r\ndear Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least, if you will only give me the voluptuous satisfaction\r\nof hearing all the details from your lips afterwards; it would stimulate\r\nus both to additional raptures, and spur our desires to renewed\r\ncombats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it wants much to do that; your glorious prick is as hard\r\nas iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the lascivious idea of your enjoying Lizzie that made it get up,\r\nbut I must fuck you again or it will burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, my dear boy, am inflamed at the idea; put it in behind this\r\ntime; I have a great letch in that way at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as I was directed, and so great was the agony of delight when we\r\ndied away that she sank on the bed dragging me after her, and we lay\r\nalmost insensible, soaking in bliss for quite half an hour. We did not\r\nagain renew our conversation that night, but I determined to push her\r\nforward to carry out her idea, and also to give Lizzie a hint to second\r\nher wishes in every way, without giving her any idea of what had passed\r\nbetween Lizzie and me, and being equally reserved as to my nightly\r\nconnection with Miss Frankland.\r\n\r\nThe following night we passed again in all the amatory delights we could\r\nimagine. After our deep midnight sleep, which always took place locked\r\nin each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and poor cockey held firm as if in a vice, I awoke\r\nher first, and found my prick stiff-standing in her cunt, which was\r\ninvoluntarily pressing it in the delicious interior folds. I began\r\nmoving gently, until she was so excited as to quite wake up, when she\r\njoined me in all the raptures of a delicious and voluptuous fresh\r\nmorning fuck. We then rose to satisfy natural wants, and cool our\r\nexcited nerves by a copious ablution. As we were returning to bed, I\r\nobserved that Miss Frankland took something out of her wardrobe wrapped\r\nup in a handkerchief, and placed it under her pillow with a certain air\r\nof mystery. I said nothing. After purifying ourselves we always indulged\r\nin a voluptuous gamahuche; after which Miss Frankland generally asked,\r\nas a favour, that I should finish off _in culo_. I loved her delicious\r\nbottom-hole too dearly ever to refuse. She placed herself as usual on\r\nher knees, thighs well drawn up, and head down, so as to make the most\r\nof her glorious backside. After I had followed the usual preamble of\r\nthrusting in and out of her luscious and juicy cunt so as to lubricate\r\nmy prick well, I then introduced it, always with the slow and gradual\r\npressure, until it was sheathed to the hilt, when we generally paused\r\nsome minutes to reciprocate mutual throbs and pressures. In this\r\nlascivious pause I saw her hand steal under the pillow, and draw out the\r\nhandkerchief and put it under her belly. I shortly found a considerable\r\nsubstance entering her cunt, and making my quarters still more tight and\r\nnarrow. I began to move, and found the substance in the other entrance\r\nkeeping time to my movements. I had a tight hold of her projecting\r\nclitoris, which I had frigged up to a stiff-standing point. I slipped my\r\nhand down and found she was dildoing herself with what proved to be a\r\nvery handsome dildo, in not very formidable proportions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you not do it openly, you\r\nought to know that my greatest wish is for you to enjoy these salacious\r\nmeetings in every possible voluptuous manner; frig on then, my beloved,\r\nand be sure that if it adds to your delight it adds to mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my darling Charlie, shove away, I am in the seventh heaven\r\nof delight in having as good as two pricks working in me at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would have explained more, but her words were cut short by the\r\necstasies the double fuck produced, and she spent copiously before me,\r\non finding which I held back, and was rewarded by making her spend\r\neventually with the utmost excess of delight twice to my once. By this\r\ntime it was broad daylight, and too late in the morning to enter into\r\nany conversation on the new partner in our amatory combats, which was\r\nreserved for the next meeting.\r\n\r\nThis did not occur so soon as we expected, for that day Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflowers declared themselves. It was a fortunate thing for me that she\r\nhad them at the period of the new moon, and as Mary had them at the\r\nfull, it enabled me to dedicate a night or two to my beloved sisters,\r\nwho considered I had been neglecting them of late. I said I had not felt\r\nvery well, and that I began to think that our excessive fucking was\r\nbecoming too much for me; that they must remember I was one to two, and\r\nI felt if I continued to overexert myself I should break down and fail\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would never do, dear Charlie, and it is very true you do twice our\r\nwork and more, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t pour down such a torrent as you do when\r\nwe spend; you must take care of yourself, we will not be so exacting in\r\nfuture, but cool ourselves first by a mutual gamahuche between Lizzie\r\nand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thus arranged a certain amount of cessation of fucking in that quarter\r\nthat I might dedicate the more to the far more exciting powers of the\r\ndelicious and salacious Miss Frankland.\r\n\r\nI had always remained in my own bed until I heard her heavy breathing,\r\ndenoting that she slept, before I dared to leave my own room to go to my\r\nsisters. The desire of racking me off, as dear charming Mrs. Benson used\r\nto call it, might have seized her, and my absence would have discovered\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHowever, she had, no doubt, considered that it would be all to her\r\nadvantage that I should be left perfectly quiet to recruit my system,\r\nafter the heavy drain on my amatory resources which she had kept up for\r\nthe previous fortnight. She never sought in any way to excite me until a\r\nday and a night after the cessation of her menses. She told me it was\r\nmuch better to have done with it entirely at once, rather than by erotic\r\nexcitement keep up the discharge for a week or more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is not, my dear Charlie, from any want of randy lust on my part,\r\nfor, especially at first, there is an extreme desire to be well laboured\r\nby the biggest prick one could find in existence; the natural irritation\r\nof the parts seem to be increased by the way in which the sensual system\r\nis affected in that quarter. Former experience has taught me that it is\r\nmuch better to bear this, than by seeking for erotic excitement to keep\r\nup the natural discharge for twice as long as it would otherwise endure.\r\nBesides which, there would have been a danger of affecting your dear\r\nhealth. Sometimes conjunctions, at such a period, produce a urethral\r\nirritation very prejudicial to a man, and such as might deprive me of\r\nthe delight of your embraces for some weeks. So you see, my own beloved\r\nboy, that in every way it is prudent to avoid any amorous excitement at\r\nsuch a period, however hard nature may press for venereal relief. Some\r\nwomen hazard all this, and for a momentary gratification, run risks\r\nperfectly unwarrantable, not only for themselves, but above all for\r\ntheir lovers. I, too, my darling, have had my day of imprudence, and\r\nknowing the result, I should be both cruel and stupidly insensate to let\r\nyou run the risk of what already occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she recounted those sage counsels, I could not but remember my loved\r\nMrs. Benson, whose advice had been of such service to me, and here was\r\nanother loved mistress instructing me in further matters connected with\r\nthe sex. It certainly was a stroke of great good fortune for me to have\r\nmet at so early an age two such admirable women, not only most amorous\r\nand lascivious, but instructing me in the real knowledge of their sex,\r\nand the world, at the very time that they were indulging my every\r\nlascivious desire, as well as their own. Mistresses of their art, no\r\nmystery in love\xe2\x80\x99s catalogue of excitements, and of means of gratifying\r\nthe same, was unknown to them. But they knew, too, how to inculcate\r\nwisdom for future conduct. I owe every amatory success of my after-life\r\nto the admirable teachings of these two charming and estimable women.\r\n\r\nThe next night, after we had sacrificed sufficiently often to Venus to\r\nenable us more calmly to resume the delightful discussion on the various\r\nways of pampering and exciting the passions, I turned the conversation\r\non flogging; for to take you, dear reader, into my confidence, I was\r\nseized with an uncontrollable letch to flog the superb bottom of my\r\nloved mistress. I had often seen it palpitating under the vigorous\r\nattacks of my stiff-standing pego, while belabouring either of the\r\ndelicious entrances to the temples of lust. I had often given her\r\nglorious bottom good sound slaps of the hand, but I longed to apply to\r\nit in earnest a good birch rod, see it flush to a raw meat hue, and then\r\nto shove my prick with the utmost force into either or both of the\r\ndelicious orifices. I thought the best way of arriving at this desired\r\nobject was to recur to her own description of a less severe flogging\r\nexciting the passions with pain; and as she had also admitted that it\r\nexcited her equally to be flogger or flogee, I proposed that she should\r\nexercise a gentle discipline on my bottom, to try its efficacy. She\r\njumped at the idea, but there was no rod in her room, perforce the\r\nceremony was put off until the next night. On that occasion, she advised\r\nme first to indulge in every excess of lubricity, and when nature should\r\nbegin to flag, then the real efficacy of the rod would be experienced.\r\nShe aided me with the utmost skill in every act of most voluptuous and\r\nluxurious venery, and we mutually poured down six tributes to our\r\nblessed Mother Venus, with very little cessation, for we both wished to\r\nfeel somewhat exhausted, before trying the effects of the birching\r\nsystem. We lay quiet for a short time, and then dear Miss Frankland\r\nbegan exciting me, but only in an ordinary way. My prick had already\r\nbeen too well satiated with the previous encounters to respond at once\r\nto the calls made on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in her sweetest way, \xe2\x80\x9cI see we want the rod here.\r\nPrepare yourself, sir, and take care to make no resistance, or it will\r\nbe the worse for your bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing her cue, I began to implore pity, to promise I would behave\r\nbetter in short time, etc., etc. But she was inexorable, and ordered me\r\nto lie across her knees. Then, taking me round the waist, she gave a\r\nsmart cut or two, really sharp, that made me for the moment wince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, sir, you are resisting, and you know your punishment will be\r\nsevere, if you so continue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, mistress dear, and I will never do so again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCut three, sharp, though not so severe. I did not flinch. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is\r\nsomething like a good boy, now we shall have no difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began a series of less and less severe blows, until it ended in a\r\ngentle irritable titillation which very shortly began to show its\r\neffects by the stiffness of my pego\xe2\x80\x94fiercely shoving against the naked\r\nthigh of my loved castigator, who, passing a hand round my body, laid\r\nhold of it, delighted to find how efficacious her proceedings had been.\r\nPretending to be quite exhausted, she sank back on the bed, and said she\r\ncould do no more. I sprang upon her, and we had two more _coups_ without\r\nwithdrawing, with the greatest excess of voluptuousness. It was now my\r\nturn, and as she let me slip out of her delicious cunt, I took that up\r\nas a cause of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you naughty girl,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cis that the way you treat your\r\nmaster, bundling him out of his room in that manner; here, give me the\r\nrod, I must make your bottom pay for your ill conduct\xe2\x80\x94here, kneel on\r\nthis footstool, and lay your body over my thighs, no resistance, or it\r\nwill be the worse for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! pray, sir, do forgive me this time,\xe2\x80\x9d and she knelt at my side, and\r\npretended to cry. I forced her down, and she presented her glorious\r\nbackside, in all its splendour of rotundity and size, before my\r\ndelighted gaze. I seized her round the waist, and first gloated my sight\r\nwith all the full and lascivious charms, not only displayed, but in my\r\npower, and I armed with a splendid rod. I gave her two or three sharp\r\ncuts, which made her beauteous buttocks wriggle, but called forth no\r\nremonstrances; but as I continued, in all the rage of lust the exercise\r\nexcited, to flog away most severely, she begged me to be somewhat more\r\ngentle. But I flogged on with increased vigour, until she began to\r\nwrithe under the severity of the punishment I was inflicting. She\r\nstruggled fiercely, at last, to be free, but she was completely in my\r\npower, and I did not spare her until I saw that, changing from severe\r\npain, her feelings were turning to a storm of lechery and lust. She\r\nbecame frantic with excitement, and screamed out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCease, darling Charlie, and fuck me directly. I am dying for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI threw down the rod, jumped on the bed, and drew up her loins, so that\r\nshe was placed in a kneeling position; she herself seized my bursting\r\nprick, and carried it to the lips of her cunt, where he instantly\r\nengulphed himself to the hilt. Her movements became lascivious beyond\r\nexpression, and were urged with a vigour, which brought down in a very\r\nshort time a torrent of sperm from both of us. We were too much excited\r\nto stop short, and almost without a pause, a second course was run still\r\nmore voluptuously. She was not even then satisfied, but making me lie on\r\nmy back, she reversed herself upon me, and we commenced a mutual\r\ngamahuche. I succeeded in making her spend again, and she was able to\r\nbring my pego up to a standing point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Charlie, dear, we must finish off behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo getting again on her hands and knees, she guided my willing prick to\r\nthe narrower abode of felicity. After first steeping it for a moment in\r\nthe moisture of her foaming and reeking cunt, I thrust it into her\r\nbottom-hole. I seized hold of her clitoris, she had her dildo all ready,\r\nand working it herself with one hand, we ran a last course of most\r\nlustful and lecherous enjoyment, which ended in such killing raptures\r\nthat we both sank all but insensible on the bed. Exhausted as we were by\r\nthe wild excesses we had indulged in, we fell, without moving or\r\nregaining our senses, into a deep and profound slumber, until almost too\r\nlate in the morning, so that I had to regain my room the moment we\r\nawoke, without attempting any further amorous toyings. Thus ended my\r\nfirst experiences as a flogger. The sensation was so new, and the\r\ntemptation to lay on with a vengeance was so great, that I had gone\r\nbeyond all reasonable bounds in inflicting such a severe punishment on\r\nthe glorious bum of my beloved Miss Frankland. I must, however, do her\r\nthe justice to say that she comprehended and excused the feelings under\r\nwhich I acted, only begging me, on any future occasion not to let them\r\ncarry me away so far as they had done on this. We several times renewed\r\nthis bum flogging, but with more moderate inflictions\xe2\x80\x94sufficient to\r\nhighly excite without actually punishing the patient, whichever of us it\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nWe often after this made flogging the theme of our discussions, and I\r\ngradually led on to the idea she had expressed of Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s evidently\r\namorous disposition. She still affirmed that such was her conviction. I\r\nthen suggested that it would be worth her while to try and gratify it,\r\nas well for Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s sake as for the satisfaction of her own letch in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you could easily find a pretext if you desired to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, easily enough, the idea excites me, and I shall indulge it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not remember what the pretext was, but Lizzie was kept in next\r\nafternoon at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94Mary and I proceeded to the summer house. I\r\nknew we should not be interrupted by Lizzie, and that I need not hold in\r\nfor her satisfaction. So I gave Mary all the benefit of our being alone,\r\nand we had four most exquisite and refined indulgencies in every\r\nattitude admitted of by the legitimate entrance to love\xe2\x80\x99s temple. For,\r\nas yet, I had never been able to gain an entrance to the narrower\r\norifice, which was too small for my formidable weapon to penetrate. It\r\nis odd how easily Lizzie accommodated me in her delicious bottom-hole,\r\nwhile Mary, older and more womanly in form, was as yet unable to make\r\nroom for me in that strait path of bliss. When night came I was all\r\ncuriosity to know how my dear mistress had carried on matters with\r\nLizzie. She told me that Lizzie had been somewhat nervous at first, but\r\nshe had spoken kindly to her, told her how her amiable and loving\r\nconduct after her first whipping had won her affection; that she did not\r\nmean to be so severe as on the former occasion, but that discipline must\r\nbe kept up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo come, my dear girl, drop off your frock, as I shall mine, that the\r\nbundle of clothes may be out of the way, as well as to avoid their being\r\ncreased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that Lizzie still trembled a little after she had dropped her\r\ngown, she took her in her arms, and kissing her lovingly, desired her\r\nnot to be afraid\xe2\x80\x94she would not punish her much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLift up all your things, my dear, and let me see if any marks of the\r\nformer punishment remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLizzie had a very prominent and very promising bottom. Miss Frankland\r\nfelt it all over, and admired loudly its form and firmness, declaring it\r\nwas quite beautiful to look at, and how womanly it was growing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn round, and let me see if you are as womanly in front. Upon my\r\nword, a well-formed mount with a charming mossy covering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand wandering over her form excited Lizzie, whose face flushed and\r\neyes glistened with rising desires. Miss Frankland herself became moved,\r\nbut proceeded at once to lay her across her lap, and began with gentle\r\nswitches, just sufficiently sharp to attract the blood in that\r\ndirection, which, of course, acted with double force on all the already\r\nexcited erotic organs, and Lizzie began to wriggle her bum in all the\r\nlasciviousness of lust under the excited gaze of Miss Frankland, who,\r\nseeing how matters were going on in her favour, increased the force of\r\nher blows, but only sufficiently to still more lecherously excite her\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x94until, driven to an excess of lust, she cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my loved Miss Frankland, I am dying with pleasure, do embrace and\r\ncaress me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Frankland lifted her up, and drew her to her bosom and lips, and,\r\nwhile sucking her tongue, slipped her hand down and found Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s quim\r\nwet with her flowing spunk, and her little clitoris stiff with the\r\nerotic passion that was consuming her. She frigged her until she spent\r\nagain, while their tongues were in each other\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. As Lizzie spent,\r\nMiss F, shoved a finger up her cunt, which, of course, met with no\r\nresistance, but as Lizzie possessed in perfection the art of nipping,\r\nshe was sufficiently tight to leave a doubt of anything but\r\nfinger-fucking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you little puss, you have been playing with this before now, tell\r\nme the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you everything, if you will only play with me again. Ever\r\nsince you flogged Mary and myself, we have both been so often burning\r\ndown there, and have found out that feeling it, and pushing fingers in,\r\nwas so nice, although at first we often hurt ourselves. But you do it so\r\nmuch better than Mary\xe2\x80\x94oh, do, do it again, dear Miss Frankland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do it much better, my darling, with what I have got down\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94look here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, lifting up her petticoat and chemise, she exposed, to the absolute\r\nastonishment of Lizzie, her extraordinary mass of hair, and her fiery\r\nred clitoris glowing and sticking out of its black mass of curls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x9cI declare, you have got a doodle, for\r\nwhich I have been so longing; I must kiss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStooping down, she took it in her mouth, and sucked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, dear Lizzie, we shall both enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTaking the cushion from the chair, she lay down on her back on the\r\nfloor, telling Lizzie to turn her face the other way, and to kneel down\r\nacross her body, so that both their mouths could adapt themselves to\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s quim.\r\n\r\nLizzie told me afterwards that she took care to show no previous\r\nknowledge, but to let Miss Frankland apparently initiate her into all\r\nthe ceremonies of gamahuching.\r\n\r\nMiss Frankland glued her lips to dear Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s charming quim, while\r\nLizzie took her extraordinary clitoris into her mouth. After a few\r\nardent caresses Miss Frankland pushed a finger up Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole,\r\nthen paused an instant to tell Lizzie not only to follow her example in\r\nthat respect, but to use her other hand in her quim while sucking her\r\nclitoris. Then, both adapting themselves as prescribed, they gamahuched\r\non, until both could no longer move from the excessive raptures produced\r\nby their profuse discharge. After this first bout Lizzie became curious\r\nto see all the wonderful hair-covered organ and limbs of Miss Frankland,\r\nwho gratified her to the utmost extent of her wishes. Nor did she leave\r\nthis inspection entirely to Lizzie, but reciprocated it. Undoing her\r\ndress above, she uncovered the charming budding beauties of Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbubbies, and began sucking the nipples. Their mutual caresses and\r\nhandlings very quickly refired these hot and lecherous women. After a\r\nlittle renewed gamahuching, until both were wild with excitement, Miss\r\nFrankland proposed to put her clitoris into Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s quim; told her to\r\nkneel down, and kneeling behind her, she sheathed it with ease in the\r\nhot and juicy folds of Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful cunt. Passing her hand under\r\nLizzie\xe2\x80\x99s belly, she frigged her clitoris until again nature gave down\r\nher delicious tribute, and they sank in all the voluptuous languor that\r\nfollows. A third time they renewed their salacious and lascivious\r\nraptures, then resumed their dresses so as to be ready to receive us.\r\nMiss Frankland begged Lizzie to keep her counsel and not reveal, even to\r\nMary, what had passed. But Lizzie urged Miss F. to admit Mary into the\r\nnew mysteries she had just herself been taught, and said she could\r\nassure her that Mary had a far more beautiful body than hers, and would\r\nlike it quite as well as she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, I shall think of it, and find an occasion to flog her,\r\nas I have done you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that will be jolly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will like it just as much\r\nas I do; it is so nice, you must flog me every day, dear Miss Frankland.\r\nI loved you from the first, I adore you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey embraced most lovingly, but our return put an end for the present\r\nto any further conversation.\r\n\r\nThese details were accompanied and interrupted by two or three delicious\r\nand most voluptuous fucks, without once withdrawing my burning prick\r\nfrom her equally heated and throbbing cunt\xe2\x80\x94for her description of these\r\nproceedings was most exciting. When she had finished, I withdrew, that\r\nwe might gamahuche each other, and lick up all the delicious spunk in\r\nwhich her juicy cunt abounded. We then renewed our combats, sacrificing\r\nto holy Mother Venus in both orifices. Then we slept as only\r\neasy-conscienced people like ourselves could sleep; and, like giants\r\nrefreshed by slumber, renewed our devotions on every altar before\r\nseparating in the morning.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Mary was initiated by Miss Frankland in a like manner to\r\nLizzie, while Lizzie and I made the most of our time in the summer\r\nhouse. Excited by her naive description of her scene with Miss\r\nFrankland, we indulged in every salacious device that we could cram into\r\nthe hour\xe2\x80\x99s absence, which, by the way, we lengthened out by more than a\r\nquarter of an hour, for which Miss Frankland thanked me at night. Her\r\nscene with Mary had been one of even greater lubricity, in consequence\r\nof Mary at once lending herself to everything, and acknowledging that\r\nshe knew from Lizzie what she had to expect. Besides, Mary\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\ndeveloped form and something about her greatly excited Miss F., and she\r\nwas quite amorous upon her. She had done so much in the way of spending,\r\nthat after I had gamahuched and fucked her two entrances three times,\r\nshe required the stimulus of the rod to bring her up to the highest\r\npoint of lascivious lubricity. And, to tell the truth, I afterwards\r\nrequired and received it myself. Thus our voluptuous passions acted one\r\non the other, and we passed an exhausting night in every excess and\r\nrefinement of venery, in which Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s dildoes, for she had\r\ntwo, of different sizes, played no small part in both our persons.\r\n\r\nNow that the ice was broken, I easily persuaded Miss F. to have\r\noccasionally first one and then the other of my sisters to sleep with\r\nher, alleging that an occasional early night\xe2\x80\x99s rest would recruit my\r\npowers, and that when she dismissed her bedfellow in the morning, I\r\ncould finish her off in force; she could thus initiate them in mutual\r\nfloggings, and in the use of dildo. Of course, I need not say that my\r\nultimate object was to succeed in our making it a general orgie. In this\r\nindeed it ended, but not exactly as I had intended. That mattered not,\r\nas long as the desired object was attained. I had the delightful\r\nopportunity, too, of watching through my peephole many of the delicious\r\nscenes of lubricity enacted, and when driven to the fiercest excess of\r\npassion, I used to withdraw, steal up to the unoccupied sister, and vent\r\nmy raging lust in every indulgence with her.\r\n\r\nThis had been carried on for about a fortnight, one or other of the\r\ngirls sleeping every other night with Miss Frankland. Lizzie, it\r\nappeared, had often professed to long to see a real cock, and had\r\nmanaged to worm out of Miss F. that she had enjoyment of mine. The\r\nlittle hussey importuned Miss F. to let her see me fucking her, saying\r\nthat she could easily hide behind the curtains, and I would never know.\r\nMiss F., whose passions were at the utmost tension of desire, consented,\r\nand placing Lizzie where she could see without being seen, opened my\r\ndoor, but found an empty bed. She at first suspected that I had gone to\r\none of the female servants, but thought she would make sure and see if\r\nMary was not the object. So she stole softly upstairs, and found us in\r\nthe act of enjoying a double gamahuche, which as it was early morning\r\nlight, she could see without difficulty. She had the kindness to let us\r\nenjoy it to the end, and then dragging me off, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charles! this is dreadful! Why could you not be content with\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x94have I ever refused you? Do you know this would be the ruin of all\r\nof us if ever it should become known? You are too young to know the\r\ndreadful consequences of discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere she burst out in a torrent of tears\xe2\x80\x94it was evident from real fear\r\nof the sad results that might ensue, and not from any feeling of\r\njealousy. I threw myself into her arms, and as she had herself\r\nacknowledged our intimacy, I had less difficulty in alluding to it. I\r\ncaressed and fondled her, and told her there was no fear of\r\ndiscovery\xe2\x80\x94less now than ever\xe2\x80\x94as we would be all interested alike in\r\nkeeping our secret; she would cover my intimacy with my sisters, and\r\nthey would cover my intimacy with her. All at once she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has this been going on?\xe2\x80\x94tell me truly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had long prepared myself for such a question, and at once replied that\r\nafter the description of the libidinous scenes that had taken place\r\nbetween her and them, and her exquisite account of their young charms, I\r\ngot so lecherous upon them that I had sought Mary out while she was\r\nengaged with Lizzie, and Lizzie when Mary was with her; they were both\r\ntoo much delighted to refuse me anything, and we had now enjoyed each\r\nother about a dozen times. I had previously told my sisters to support\r\nany story I might recount to Miss F. Lizzie had stolen up after she\r\nfound Miss Frankland had passed through my room, and now both confirmed\r\nthe tale told. We surrounded Miss Frankland, caressing her in every way.\r\nMy pego got terribly excited. Drawing up my nightshirt, I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet this dear fellow make peace between us, and become equally dear to\r\nall. I know, my loved mistress, that my sisters are longing to see him\r\nexercised on your glorious person, and buried in your delicious hairy\r\ncunt, so let me offer up sacrifice to its juicy charms. Lizzie has just\r\nsaid you sought me for the purpose\xe2\x80\x94see, the dear clitoris is raising its\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94let Mary lie down under you to suck your clitoris, and see my prick\r\nclose above her eyes in vigorous action filling your exquisite cunt. You\r\ncan gamahuche her and Lizzie can look on behind, witness the glorious\r\nsight, and act postillion to my bottom-hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my beloved children, the die is cast, it is no use crying after\r\nspilt milk, so let us make the best of it. I never could resist the\r\neloquent look of this loved and long thick thing, that was made for\r\ngiving poor woman all she could crave for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo arranging our relative positions as I had prescribed, we ran a course\r\nof the most luxurious and salacious enjoyment imaginable. Lizzie, who\r\nhad taken possession of one of the dildoes, manipulated herself, while\r\nwatching every voluptuous movement of our bodies, and we all managed to\r\nspend most rapturously together. We could not afford to do more at that\r\nmoment, as time was creeping on, and the household would soon be astir.\r\nMiss Frankland regained with me my room, her own door being locked, and\r\nkissing me tenderly, said I was a bad boy, but she supposed it must\r\neventually have come to this, so it was well it was sooner than later.\r\n\r\nThus passed our first general orgie, which was the precursor of many\r\nmuch more luxuriously and salaciously libidinous, and which I shall more\r\nminutely describe as events progress.\r\n\r\nMiss Frankland would not allow us to have a general orgie the next\r\nnight. She was now aware of our summer house doings\xe2\x80\x94only of late begun,\r\nas she supposed\xe2\x80\x94for my story had been too plausibly off-hand not to\r\ndeceive her, especially as she had felt convinced by all that occurred\r\non our first fucking that she had had the delightful pleasure of taking\r\nmy maidenhead. She was quite satisfied on that head. But she now\r\nsuspected that what I had just begun I should be too glad to repeat. She\r\naccompanied us to the garden in our recreation hour, so that nothing\r\nerotic took place. We sat down all together after a little running\r\nabout, and Miss F. opened to us a rule of conduct we must in future\r\npursue. She said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever delightful it would be for you all, as well as for myself, to\r\nmeet every night, it would in the first instance become a dangerous\r\nhabit, dangerous because of engendering carelessness in the necessary\r\nprecautions against discovery; and next, and above all, because it would\r\nbe the destruction of our loved and darling Charlie, who could not\r\npossibly long continue such excessive venery as three loved objects at\r\nonce would constantly require of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing my inclination to interrupt her, and declare that I felt quite\r\nequal to it, she stopped me, and told us I was too young to know what\r\nsuch excessive indulgence would lead to; that we must trust to her\r\nexperience and be guided by her, and we should all find the advantage of\r\nit. Three times a week was the utmost she could allow, when we should be\r\nall together. The other nights she would take care that I committed no\r\nexcess. Such were the sage counsels of this admirable woman, and such in\r\nfuture became the programme of our proceedings. I rebelled and kicked\r\nagainst what I thought at the time too great a restriction, but I\r\neventually became convinced that greater pleasure followed the enforced\r\ndelays. Of course I slept with Miss Frankland on what might be called\r\nour off nights, but she soon established a custom of restraining my\r\nspendings to twice a night, allowing me to excite and make her spend as\r\noften as I pleased. I was difficult to manage at first, but eventually\r\nsettled down in great regularity to the rules she dictated, and, indeed,\r\nenforced. I soon found out the wisdom of her proceeding, for often\r\nafterwards my lagging efforts required the spur of the rod to be applied\r\nin earnest for the completion of our orgies.\r\n\r\nThe second night after the discovery of my intercourse with my sisters\r\nwas the first of meeting all four together, in Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s room. We\r\nhad been sent, as usual, early to bed, and Miss F. had privately\r\nrecommended us to go quietly to sleep as soon as possible, and not to be\r\nunder any anxiety, as she herself would go for the girls, after all the\r\nhousehold had retired. As for me, it was the plan I had always adopted,\r\nas it enabled me to reap the greater amount of enjoyment, and its longer\r\ncontinuance, by the rest I had previously secured. Winter had passed\r\naway, and summer came round again. It was a lovely, warm, moonlight\r\nnight. As soon as we were all assembled, stripping to the buff was the\r\norder of the night; then followed charming embraces and mutual posings,\r\nso as each should admire the beauties of all. Hands wandered everywhere\r\nover every charm, chiefly concentrating on the wonderful and finely\r\ndeveloped form of the fascinating Frankland, whose richness of\r\ncoal-black hair was so deliciously exciting. It soon became necessary to\r\ncalm the first effervescence of our passions, which we always did by a\r\ngeneral gamahuche. Miss Frankland, who had taken an extraordinary letch\r\nfor Mary, paired off with her, while Lizzie and I accommodated each\r\nother. Miss Frankland, who had provided herself with a store of dildoes,\r\nfurnished us all with one, differing in size, according to the intention\r\nof their application. As Mary\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole as yet could only\r\naccommodate a moderate size, Miss F. kept the smallest for her\r\nparticular use, the others were indiscriminately used. Thus armed, we\r\nproceeded to enter on all the voluptuous excesses of gamahuching in\r\nevery form, lengthening out our pleasures as much and as long as\r\npossible, that we might pass the whole night in the most libidinous\r\nraptures. When the ecstatic moment overtook us, our mouths had to cease\r\ntheir operations to give vent to the expressions of the rapturous nature\r\nof our feelings. We lay panting for some time before being able to rise\r\nand resume our mutual caresses. Now that we had taken off the edge of\r\nour lustful appetite, we prepared more calmly for further and more\r\nvoluptuous combinations. The upper coverings of the bed were entirely\r\nremoved, so that it presented nearly a square field of combat for love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nencounters, admirably adapted for its purpose. We held a council as to\r\nour next movements, and finally decided to begin as follows: Mary to lie\r\ndown on her back, Lizzie reversed above her, Miss Frankland was to\r\nindulge in her letch for Lizzie, which was that of fucking her\r\nbottom-hole with her extraordinary clitoris, while I was to fuck Miss\r\nFrankland\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, and postillion her smaller orifice with two fingers,\r\nLizzie was to postillion Mary with her finger, while gamahuching her,\r\nMary to apply the smaller dildo to my bottom-hole, and frig Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncunt with a larger one. It was also agreed we should run two courses in\r\nthis voluptuous group, varying only in the substitution of my prick in\r\nMiss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole, instead of her cunt, in which was to be\r\nplaced one of the dildoes. We were none of us to press matters to a\r\nspeedy termination, but to make the most of the exquisite conjunction of\r\nour parts. We enjoyed a most salacious and voluptuous fuck, and so\r\nmanaged matters as all should spend together in perfect raptures of\r\nlubricity and lust. Notwithstanding the pleasure of the final discharge,\r\nwe managed, as previously agreed, to hold our mutual positions, our\r\nparts palpitating with repeated throbbings on or in the delicious\r\nquarters with which they were conjoined. These soon reawakened our\r\npassions, which we as yet had done but little to calm, and when\r\nsufficiently heated, the slight change agreed upon was effected, and I\r\nplunged up to the hilt in the glorious and hairy bottom-hole of the\r\ndivine Frankland, who gave almost a scream of delight as she felt my\r\nhuge pego rushing up into her burning entrails. We had to pause some\r\nminutes to allow her excitement to subside to a certain extent, or she\r\nwould have discharged after two or three thrusts of my potent weapon. We\r\nthen proceeded more leisurely, and after drawing out our enjoyment in\r\nthe most salacious and voluptuous manner, the ecstatic moment seized us\r\nall together, with such an excess of wild enjoyment that with screams of\r\nalmost agonised delight, we poured into or upon each other whole\r\ntorrents of hot boiling sperm, and sank almost insensible into a\r\nconfused heap of naked forms. We were a long time in recovering our\r\nsenses. Then disentangling ourselves, we rose and laved our parts in\r\ncold water, not only to purify ourselves, but as a stimulant to further\r\nexertions in all the wildest excesses of lubricity that any of us could\r\nfancy. But we always managed so as to make Miss F. think that she was\r\nthe author of any new salacious idea or suggestion. In fact she nearly\r\nwas so in every case, for her experience in every letch, and its\r\ngratification in every form of libidinous refinement, was great and we\r\nowed to her many new and delicious combinations in our salacious orgies.\r\nAfter partaking of wine and cake, which Miss F. had taken care to\r\nsecure, we indulged in some delicious romping and pulling about of the\r\nrich curls and hairy coverings of nearly all Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s superb\r\nform. The girls above all admired the magnitude, hardness, and beauty of\r\nher truly magnificent buttocks, and what with one now and then sucking\r\nher bubbies, and at other times toying with her already standing\r\nclitoris, we soon brought her to such a state of excitement that,\r\nseizing hold of Mary, she got her on the table and gamahuched her, while\r\nLizzie, creeping under, sucked her clitoris, and I pushed my prick from\r\nbehind into her cunt. We brought on a delicious spend, and the glorious\r\ncreature died away in excess of pleasure along with Mary, while I had\r\nnot yet arrived at the climax. So I contented myself with making my\r\nprick throb to her delicious squeezings, until the fatigue of the\r\nposition required us to break up the pose. She was so far calmed that\r\nshe could now propose and discuss after-proceedings, and what our next\r\nform of enjoyment should be. As Mary had had an extra spend with Miss\r\nFrankland, Lizzie was now placed on her knees, with her head well down.\r\nI thrust my prick into her longing cunt. Miss Frankland standing up,\r\nstrode across Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s body in front of me, here I introduced first a\r\nsmaller dildo up her bottom-hole and then a larger one up her cunt, both\r\nup to the cod pieces. She then pushed forward her belly and put her\r\nstiff-standing clitoris into my mouth, and placed her two hands on my\r\nhead. I then passed one hand under her open legs, and seizing both\r\ndildoes in one hand, proceeded to work them up and down both holes at\r\nonce, in unison with my suction of her clitoris, and my fucking\r\nmovements in Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, who at the same time was frigging her own\r\nclitoris with her fingers. Mary, armed with two dildoes, applied one to\r\nmy bottom-hole, while she fucked herself with the other. In this way we\r\nran a most exciting and delicious course. Miss F., in the ecstatic\r\nmoments, seemed as if she would have pressed my head into her belly. She\r\nwas so charmed with the voluptuous delights this pose had given that she\r\ncried out we must not change until another course was run. Lizzie said\r\nshe must change from front to back, and begged Mary to hand her a dildo\r\nwith which she might frig herself. The women were ready directly, but my\r\npego was longer in answering the call, so Miss Frankland told Mary to\r\napply the birch rod skilfully.\r\n\r\nThis she did with great art, working the dildo, which was still in her\r\ncunt while so occupied. The effect was almost electrical, and my\r\nglorious rampant prick filled dear Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s delicious and longing\r\nbottom-hole to her utmost delight. Miss F. begged Mary to give her a\r\ngentle stimulus with the rod. Nothing could better have pleased Mary,\r\nfor she afterwards admitted she had long had the greatest letch to flog\r\nthat glorious and immense backside. With such stimulants as these this\r\ncourse proved one of the most salacious and voluptuous we had yet had,\r\nand the ecstatic ending was accompanied with screams of delight, as we\r\ndied away in the death-like swoon of rapturous and satiated desires. We\r\nagain rose to purify and refresh ourselves, and for some time after lay\r\nclosely embraced on the bed. As Mary had not yet had my prick in her\r\ncunt, Miss F. proposed that I should fuck her, that Lizzie should kneel\r\nclose behind us, she could fuck Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole with her clitoris,\r\nand work one dildo up my bottom, while she worked a second in her own.\r\nNo sooner said that done. Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s head was shoved almost below Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbelly, so as to bring Miss F. close enough to me to operate as she\r\ndesired, and we ran another delicious course with such extreme pleasure\r\nthat all sank sideways down on the bed and dropped into a sound slumber.\r\nWe did not awaken until so late that we only had time to lave ourselves\r\nin cold water, finish off with a general gamahuche, and then regain our\r\nseparate rooms. On this last occasion Miss Frankland said she must\r\ngamahuche me, as she delighted to break her fast on cream. The joke\r\namused the two girls amazingly.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time Mrs. Vincent gave birth to a fine boy. I have not\r\nspoken of her since our first interview after her marriage in the summer\r\nhouse, when all had gone into the town to bring out Miss Frankland. We\r\nhad only had two stolen interviews since that time, which I have not\r\nmentioned, because they were too hasty, and with too little comfort to\r\nhave been thoroughly enjoyed; then she became too heavy with child to\r\nafford me any further opportunity. Mamma wrote a congratulating letter\r\nto Mr. Vincent, wishing him joy of the advent of a son and heir, little\r\ndreaming that her own son was the father thereof. This brought a visit\r\nfrom Mr. Vincent to beg that mamma would kindly become godmother to the\r\nlittle fellow. My mother at once assented, and asked who the godfathers\r\nwere. He said an uncle, from whom they had expectations, had consented\r\nto be one, but he was at a loss to know whom to ask as second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not ask Charlie, he was always very fond of your wife as his\r\ngoverness, and he, too, has an uncle from whom we hope some day to\r\nreceive something handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very good idea of yours, Mrs. Roberts, and if you will kindly\r\nsend for Charles I shall put it to him, and if he consents, it saves me\r\nall further trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was sent for, and, you may be sure, accepted immediately, thanking Mr.\r\nVincent for the honour he did me, and hoping that Mrs. Vincent would be\r\nequally agreeable that I should be godfather, although so young.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave that to me, my dear wife is so much attached to me that my wish\r\nis her law, so do not make yourself uneasy on that head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed I was not at all uneasy, but quite certain that\r\nit was the very thing Mrs. V. would have proposed if she had not been\r\nwithheld by prudence. We heard afterwards from Mr. V. that she had\r\nsimulated objections on account of my youth, but the very first moment\r\nshe could say a word to me in private it was to tell me what delight it\r\nhad given her that her husband should have fulfilled in the matter the\r\nvery wish nearest and dearest to her heart.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony eventually came off as had been proposed, but it was at\r\nvery rare intervals that I could find an opportunity of renewing our old\r\ncombats in the field of Venus. Meanwhile I had no reason to regret this\r\nas far as indulgence of my erotic passions went, because, for nearly two\r\nyears, that is until I had passed my eighteenth birthday, I continued to\r\nenjoy uninterrupted bliss in the arms of the luxurious and fascinating\r\nMiss Frankland, or in orgies with her and my sisters, which culminated\r\nin every excess of venery capable of being enjoyed by three women and\r\none youth. In fact, we all indulged rather too freely, if I may judge\r\nfrom the fact that, at least to Miss Frankland and myself, the rod had\r\nalmost become a necessity, and occasionally even my sisters admitted it\r\ngave them a fillip. Under the able tutorship of Miss Frankland we became\r\nthe most perfect adepts in every voluptuous indulgence of lubricity. But\r\nI must also give her the credit of never neglecting our education.\r\nIndeed, I may say it gained by the intimate union of our bodies. For\r\nthat estimable woman impressed upon us that to keep her friendship and\r\nconfidence we must do justice to her teaching. I have already said her\r\nsystem of instruction was very superior to anything we had previously\r\nknown, and now that she had won our unbounded love and affection, there\r\nwas nothing we were not ready to do in school to second her efforts for\r\nour mutual improvement. She had very superior attainments\xe2\x80\x94spoke French\r\nand German like a native, had sufficient knowledge of Latin and Greek to\r\nground me well in them, and her knowledge of music was very superior. I\r\nhave hardly ever heard anyone with a more charming touch on the piano.\r\nIn the two years that followed our first orgie we made really\r\nastonishing progress. We all spoke French very fairly, had a pretty good\r\nknowledge of German, especially Mary, who really spoke it well; as for\r\nmyself I was well up in French, fairly so in German, and with a very\r\ngood groundwork of Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that an event happened which completely changed\r\nthe order of my life. My mother had hinted that I had some expectations\r\nfrom an uncle. These were very vague. He was my father\xe2\x80\x99s brother, but\r\nthey had never agreed, and we were almost strangers to each other. He\r\ndied, and one day we were all surprised, not to say delighted, to hear\r\nfrom his executor, a Mr. Nixon, a rich merchant in London, that my uncle\r\nhad left my mother four hundred pounds a year as long as she did not\r\nmarry again, but at her death the said annuity was to be divided between\r\nmy two sisters, independent of any coverture. The residue and bulk of\r\nthe property was settled on me, under trust to Mr. Nixon until I was of\r\nage, with a request that I should be brought up to the law and entered\r\nas a barrister in the Inner Temple. Further, a sum of five hundred\r\npounds was allowed for a new outfit, in every way becoming to all of us.\r\nMr. Nixon announced that in a fortnight he would take the opportunity of\r\nbeing in our neighbourhood to come over and make the necessary\r\narrangements consequent upon the altered state of affairs. He added that\r\nthe residue of the property would yield about one thousand pounds a\r\nyear, and that, therefore, my education must be looked to more closely\r\nthan it probably had been. Here was, indeed, a change. My father had\r\nleft the house and grounds, and something like six hundred pounds a year\r\nin the funds, entirely to my mother as long as she remained a widow, or\r\nuntil her death. Afterwards one hundred and fifty pounds per annum to\r\neach of my sisters, and the house and residue to me\xe2\x80\x94a moderate income\r\nrequiring other efforts to make it comfortable to one\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing. Here\r\nI was now the heir eventually to something like fifteen hundred pounds a\r\nyear, two country houses, and a very fair house besides attached to my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s house. You may easily imagine the joy of the whole family when\r\nfrom somewhat pinched economy, we found ourselves in easy circumstances,\r\nwith at once quite double our previous income. We indulged in somewhat\r\nwild dreams of what all this might produce; but mamma brought us to our\r\nsenses by informing us that until I was of age Mr. Nixon would entirely\r\ncontrol our destinies, and that it was more than probable he would\r\ninsist upon sending me to a public school. This news dashed all our\r\nhopes to pieces with a vengeance, because it was precisely on our\r\ngreater freedom that we had been counting, and now there was every\r\nprobability our delightful intercourse and delicious orgies would come\r\nto an abrupt termination. We exchanged sad and crestfallen looks on\r\nhearing this from mamma, and met in a very disconsolate humour that\r\nnight in Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s room; but that charming and estimable woman\r\ncheered us up with the hope that if a temporary separation did occur, it\r\nwould only lead to our safer and more perfect reunion hereafter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, to tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear Charlie, we have been\r\nof late too much for you, and your health and constitution will benefit\r\nby a forced inactivity, for I have observed some symptoms about you\r\nlately that prove we three have taxed you too hard. I have no doubt I\r\nshall be retained as governess to your sisters, and leave me alone to\r\nkeep them to a point that will not disappoint you when we meet again,\r\nwhich must always occur at intervals of not longer than six months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo our loving minds six months seemed an age. At the same time Miss F.\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremarks had, to a certain extent, reassured us, and although we could\r\nnot enter into our orgie with the usual fury and letch, nevertheless we\r\nmanaged to pass a night sufficiently rapturous in the enjoyment of our\r\nlibidinous passions, which many would have thought excessive.\r\n\r\nIn due course Mr. Nixon made his appearance. He was a pleasant-looking\r\nelderly gentleman, and a complete man of the world. Finding that I had\r\nbeen educated entirely at home under governesses, he fancied I must be a\r\nmilk-and-watery ignorant youth, and had already hinted as much to\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x94who, having told me, put me on my mettle. Mr. Nixon sent for me\r\ninto the parlour alone, and began an agreeable conversation apparently\r\nleading to nothing, probably with a view not to render me nervous and\r\ntimid, gradually turning the conversation upon educational subjects. He\r\nwas agreeably surprised to find the progress I had made, not only in\r\nhistorical and geographical subjects, but in languages, and above all\r\nwas surprised at my knowledge of Latin and Greek. He was particular in\r\nasking if some clergyman had not lent his aid to the governess. After\r\ndinner, during which he paid great attention to Miss Frankland, he\r\nwarmly complimented her on her system of teaching and its extraordinary\r\nsuccess. At the same time he observed that, as his dear old friend had\r\ndesired that his nephew should become a barrister, it would be necessary\r\nhe should be sent to some clergyman taking a few boys, and then to\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s College, London, before entering a barrister\xe2\x80\x99s chambers. Miss\r\nFrankland at once admitted the justice of the remark, and hoped that\r\nCharles would not shame her teaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary, I assure you, Miss Frankland. I have been struck\r\nwith the admirable groundwork you have established, and especially the\r\nadvantages you have given him of the knowledge of modern languages. I am\r\nso much pleased that I intend to beg of Mrs. Roberts to keep you as the\r\nable governess of the girls until they are so much older as to require a\r\nlittle knowledge of the world which a metropolitan ladies\xe2\x80\x99 school is\r\nsure to impart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was said with a certain deference of manner to Miss Frankland,\r\nthat I felt certain the old gentleman was greatly struck with her\r\nperson, as well as her system of teaching. But of this it is probable my\r\nreaders will learn more hereafter.\r\n\r\nMy mother, hearing of the intention of sending me to some clergyman,\r\nimmediately suggested that her own brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr.\r\nBrownlow, rector of Leeds, in Kent, a retired village close to the\r\ncastle of that name, would be a suitable person. He was a gentleman who\r\nhad taken honours at Cambridge, and was in the habit of receiving one,\r\ntwo or even three young gentlemen, but never more, to prepare them for\r\nthe universities. At that moment she knew by a letter from her sister\r\nthat he had a vacancy. His name, she said, stood high as an instructor,\r\nas Mr. Nixon would find on inquiry; and as Charles had never been away\r\nfrom home, it would be a great satisfaction to her to know that he was\r\nunder the care of her own sister. Mr. Nixon said he perfectly agreed to\r\nher suggestion, provided, as to which he had no doubt, his inquiries\r\njustified his sending me there. He left us with a promise of an early\r\ndecision, and, indeed, before the week had passed we received his full\r\nconcurrence to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion. So my aunt was written to, and it\r\nbeing the period of the holidays, Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow were asked to\r\ncome over and spend a week, and then I could return with them to Kent.\r\nWe had not seen aunt or uncle since we were little children, and only\r\nremembered her as a very tall immense person. The distance had prevented\r\npersonal intercourse, and we only knew of them by interchanges of hams,\r\nCanterbury brawn, and oysters at Christmas time. As they replied by\r\nreturn of post, saying they would be with us in two or three days\r\nfollowing their letter, you may be sure Miss Frankland and all of us\r\nmade the most of what was to be the last of our mutual orgies for the\r\ntime. No restrictions were put upon us, and every night was dedicated to\r\nthe god of lust and voluptuousness.\r\n\r\nAt last the fatal day arrived. My mother and the two girls went into the\r\ntown to fetch uncle and aunt out, leaving Miss Frankland and me to our\r\nstudies. You may well suppose it was the prosody of love and not that of\r\ngrammar that occupied us. There was a tenderness of manner, and a loving\r\nkindness and fondling, which I had not before observed in Miss\r\nFrankland, and which I should have thought alien to her character.\r\nEmbracing me tenderly, and pressing me lovingly to her bosom, she burst\r\ninto a flood of tears, and sobbed as if her heart would break as her\r\nhead sank on my shoulder. I tried to comfort her in the best way I\r\ncould, and as my kind reader knows, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tears always had a most\r\npotent effect on my prick, I placed it in her hand, she hysterically\r\nlaughed amidst her crying, but instantly sank her head down to the loved\r\nobject, embraced, sucked, and frigged it until I poured a flood of\r\nboiling sperm into her mouth, which she greedily swallowed, and\r\ncontinued sucking until not a drop was left. Then rising once more to\r\ncaress and embrace me, she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my own beloved boy, that was indeed a means to stop my tears, I\r\nnot only adore it, but have come to love you, my darling, more than I\r\never loved anything in my life\xe2\x80\x94you are my own scholar, bodily and\r\nmentally. I shall miss you greatly, and I bitterly regret our parting;\r\nbut we shall meet again, although never with such freedom and ease as we\r\nhave done. You will spend your holidays at home, and we shall make the\r\nmost of them. I can feel the dear object already to be made the most of\r\nagain, and so it shall, dear fellow, so come to its own nest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese last fond words were addressed to my prick, which, already rampant\r\nagain, was claiming attention. We went at it, hammer and tongs.\r\nRecruited at luncheon, we renewed the raptures of lubricity as that\r\nestimable woman alone knew how to indulge them. We were the less\r\nreasonable, as it had been decided by us the night before that I was to\r\nfind out the habits of the coming couple before I should venture on\r\nleaving my room to slip up to theirs, and thus I had a night of\r\nrelaxation before me.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock the carriage drove up, and uncle and aunt were welcomed\r\nto our house. My uncle was a tall, portly, unctuous-looking clergyman,\r\nquite a gentleman in his manners, and with a very agreeable voice. My\r\naunt, who was some fifteen years my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s junior, was very tall for\r\nher sex, a fine portly figure, broad shouldered, large bubbies well\r\napart, a small waist for her size, immense hips and evidently buttocks\r\nto more than match. She was very stout, but stood firm upon her pins,\r\nand walked with great elasticity of step, showing there was a good deal\r\nin her, or rather she could take a good deal out of anybody. She had a\r\nprofusion of fair hair, with thick eyebrows, that promised abundance\r\nelsewhere. Her eyes were of a deep blue that could look very far into\r\nyou. She had a very pleasing expression, a small mouth, and very white\r\nteeth. Her complexion was exceedingly fair, her arms immense, but\r\nbeautifully formed, hands and feet small, fat and plump. She looked\r\nthirty-five, but was nearly forty, and was altogether a most desirable\r\nwoman to look at, on a large scale. She embraced me tenderly, which I\r\ndid not fail to return, and complimented me and the whole family on our\r\nlate good fortune. The first introduction was altogether most agreeable,\r\nand I already began to imagine I might not be so badly off after all.\r\n\r\nWe were allowed to sit up rather later than usual, and as my aunt was\r\nfatigued with her day and night\xe2\x80\x99s journey, they were glad to follow our\r\nexample almost immediately. I had only just time to get undressed, when\r\nI heard them enter the room which Miss Frankland had vacated the\r\nprevious day. This had previously been arranged, and she now slept in my\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, as formerly, until we should depart. I quickly blew out\r\nmy light, for fear they should observe it shining through the chinks I\r\nhad made. Kneeling down, I began to watch the proceedings. The first\r\nthing my aunt did was to squat on the pot just opposite my peephole, and\r\nas she held up her dress well, I could see that she had a most prominent\r\nmons Veneris, thickly covered with very fair ringlets. Her power of piss\r\nwas something wonderful, it was like a cataract in force and quantity,\r\nand at once made my mutinous prick stand at the mighty rush of waters\r\nthat could be so plainly heard. As she rose, and before she dropped her\r\ndress, I saw her splendid proportions of limb, the like of which had\r\nnever before met my eyes. Alas! it was but a passing glimpse. However, I\r\ndetermined to watch on, hoping to see a further display in the course of\r\nundressing. She took off all her upper clothes, until nothing but her\r\nstays and chemise remained. I could now mark the real grandeur of her\r\nproportions. The stays kept in the waist, and allowed the splendour of\r\nher hips and buttocks to stand out in all their glory. Never in my life\r\nhave I seen a finer backside than my aunt had got. I am now speaking\r\nfrom a vast amount of after-inspection and adoration, but in its covered\r\nmagnificence in which I at this moment viewed it, it appeared the finest\r\nbackside I have ever met with, and was in fact the one I alluded to some\r\ntime back, when I observed that Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s was the finest but one\r\nI ever saw. It is true, her stoutness added greatly to its prominence,\r\nbut though stout, even very stout, it was not a stoutness you could call\r\nfat. For in after-intimacy, which became of the very closest and most\r\nvoluptuous nature, I was never able to pinch her in any muscular part.\r\nShe had the hardest, as well as the biggest, backside I ever met with. I\r\nam quite sure that when she was standing upright, a child might have\r\nstood on the immense projections of her buttocks. Her thighs were\r\npositively monstrous in their mighty proportions, as hard as iron,\r\nexquisitely moulded, and of a fairness and smoothness that rivalled\r\nivory, which, in another respect, they much resembled, namely, in\r\nfeeling cold to the touch. Her legs were worthy of the glorious frame\r\nthey supported, and finished off with a pair of charming, clean-run\r\nankles, and very small feet for her size. As her chemise was short\r\nsleeved, the grand magnificence and beauty of form of her splendid arms\r\nand neck, where the bubbies came out in all their perfection and\r\nbrilliancy of skin, were fully displayed. As may be supposed, not a bone\r\nwas to be traced in her upper neck, but all was dazzling in colour and\r\nflesh, which is such a beauty in woman. When a woman shows her gaunt\r\ncollar bones, it is a proof of bad breeding, and a common nature. Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntruly grand bubbies rose magnificently over her bodice, which I thought\r\nat the time was their support, but this glorious woman required nothing\r\nof the sort, for when perfectly stripped, her bubbies stood out firm and\r\nprojecting in all their grandeur, and they were of the largest, worthy\r\nof all her other fully developed charms. Her belly alone was somewhat\r\ntoo prominent, when standing up, but as she never had had children, it\r\ndid not at all hang flabbily, and ended in one of the most prominent and\r\nlargely developed montis Veneris I have ever met with, profusely covered\r\nwith the fairest of curls, which did not prevent her lovely creamy skin\r\nfrom shining through them. She was well provided with hair on that part,\r\nbut after the extraordinary hairy covering that Miss Frankland\r\npossessed, and with which I had so often toyed, all other women appeared\r\nas nothing in that way. My aunt, after donning a nightrobe, sat down to\r\nher toilet, and proceeded to let down her massive bunch of tresses.\r\nHere, she was, indeed, richly gifted, her hair was all her own, in the\r\nutmost profusion, and, tall as she was, fell much below her buttocks,\r\nand was so thick that she could let it spread over both back and front,\r\nand completely cover her nakedness. Titian must have had such another\r\nmagnificent head of hair for one of his models, for it exactly\r\nresembled, except in being somewhat of a fairer hue, his celebrated\r\nMagdalen, in the Pitti Palace, at Florence, where she is represented\r\ncovered only with the rich profusion of her ringlets. Such was my aunt,\r\nand often and often afterwards has she indulged all my fancies, by\r\nshowing herself off in every voluptuous attitude with this, the greatest\r\nornament of woman, flowing in the utmost profusion over her glorious and\r\nmighty charms. Meanwhile, the doctor had undressed, but it may well be\r\nsupposed perfectly unnoticed by me. I had better game in view. He, too,\r\nhad donned a _robe de chambre_, and sat down by his wife to have a chat\r\nover the occurrences of the day. Of course, their conversation very\r\nnaturally turned upon myself. They began by congratulating themselves\r\nthat the good fortune of the family was partly reflected on them by the\r\ncircumstances of my being put under the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s care. The lady remarked\r\nhow doubly fortunate it was, as the little scandal that had happened\r\nhad, for some time, prevented their having any pupils at all. The doctor\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that, my love, this little fellow will soon be the decoy\r\nduck for others; he seems a nice, gentle lad, but I shall seek to have\r\nsome talk with him tomorrow, and see what he is made of; boys, under\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, are generally mere milksops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you will find it so in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d added my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot a bad judge of character, and I feel certain that Miss Frankland is\r\ntoo stern and firm of purpose not to have bent any boy\xe2\x80\x99s will to her\r\nbidding; I fear, on the contrary, she has, if anything, been too severe\r\nwith him, for my sister told me that she had full power to wield the\r\nrod, but, after one or two severe bouts, she completely mastered them,\r\nand that their progress was really very great, and most satisfactory, as\r\nMr. Nixon, Charles\xe2\x80\x99s guardian, who had examined him, had reported most\r\nfavourably thereon. But he appears to be insignificant, and undersized,\r\nthin as a whipping post, pale, and somewhat sickly-looking, he appears\r\nmuch younger than he is, and seems hardly fitted for what you and I\r\nwould delight in. Eh! dear doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not understand at this time what her allusion meant, but it was\r\nfollowed by the doctor stooping forwards, kissing her, and, I have no\r\ndoubt, tongueing her too. He first thrust a hand below her beauteous\r\nbubbies, and then pulling up her chemise, began foraging between her\r\nlegs. She put down her hair brush; and laid hold of his cock, but\r\nquickly said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t excite me, my dear, you see this poor fellow can do nothing\r\nwithout a rod, and we have none here, so be quiet and go to bed, that is\r\na good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObeying her, he rose, threw off his robe, put on a nightcap, and tumbled\r\ninto bed, and was sound asleep before his magnificent spouse had\r\nfinished her toilet. When it was concluded, she took off her stays, and\r\ndrew her chemise over her head, I doubt if it could have fallen over her\r\nenormous buttocks. She then walked across the room in my direction,\r\nstark naked as nature made her, and strikingly magnificent in the\r\nfirmness of her tread, and the glorious uprightness of her truly superb\r\ngrandeur of form. I was positively awestruck. I could imagine her to be\r\nJuno in all her glory before Jupiter, and well he might be tempted to\r\nstray to the forbidden path of love, if Juno had such a backside as the\r\nenormous and glorious one my aunt possessed. She again squatted down,\r\nnaked as she was, and poured out another torrent into the pot. I felt\r\noverpowered at the sight, and staggered back to my bed, and for the\r\nfirst time in my life felt constrained to rack off by self-pollution the\r\nexcess of lust the gazing on such superhuman beauties had engendered. I\r\ncould hardly refrain from shouting out to relieve my till then\r\nsuppressed excitement, especially when nature gave way, and there\r\nspurted forth a jet of sperm, actually from the bed against the door\r\ntowards which I had pointed my prick while wildly frigging it, and in\r\nimagination shoving it into aunt\xe2\x80\x94anywhere; for if ever the saying that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere was plenty of good fucking about all these parts\xe2\x80\x9d was applicable\r\nto anyone, it was supremely so in my glorious aunt\xe2\x80\x99s case. Anyone might\r\nshove his prick against any part of her body, and spend at once from\r\nexcess of lust, at her very beauty and splendour of form and exquisite\r\ncolour and fineness of skin. Never, never have I met her equal. Her\r\npower of fuck, too, was on a par with the immensity of size, and of a\r\nquality to please the most fastidious, or the most lustful. Such were\r\nthe first experiences that I had of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s person, and as my\r\nnarrative extends, the reader will become more intimate with her person\r\nand proceedings. I sank to sleep, to dream of possessing her in every\r\nway, rivalling Jupiter with Juno, and Mars with Venus, mere visions of\r\nthe night, but which were in after-days converted into sweet\r\nrealisations of the most voluptuous and rapturous nature.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at our hour of recreation, Miss Frankland walked out with\r\nus, and seeking a retired part of the grounds, while the girls amused\r\nthemselves, I recounted to Miss F. all I had seen and heard. She at once\r\ncame to the conclusion that I was destined to fall into the arms of my\r\naunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so far pleased, my dear Charlie, that it will be into those of an\r\nextraordinary fine woman; you must, after your present experiences with\r\nme, have had someone to go to, and certainly you could not have a finer.\r\nThere will, evidently, be every facility, for I read those hints, which\r\nhave puzzled you, as intimating anything but reserve once you are\r\nadmitted into the inner arcana of their lives, or I am much mistaken.\r\nThere is one point I must strongly caution you about, and your general\r\nprudence and great good sense will make you appreciate its importance.\r\nYour aunt is evidently much experienced in erotic pleasures. If at once\r\nshe found in you the extraordinary adept you are, she would never cease\r\ntormenting you until she discovered who had been your instructress. Now\r\nit must be evident to you that if she thought you and I were intimate in\r\nthat way, she might draw evil inferences with regard to your sisters, or\r\nif not going so far as to think we had equally corrupted them, it is\r\nprobable enough she might seek to remove me from their society. So you\r\nsee, my darling boy, though it may be very difficult to do, you must,\r\nfor all our sakes, determine to appear quite innocent and ignorant of\r\neverything connected with indulgence in amorous passions. You must not\r\nlet yourself appear excited, but leave her to take all the initiatory\r\nsteps, and I much mistake if she will not be extremely ready to do so,\r\nbut all the more so if she finds you apparently innocent. However much\r\nyou now know of love\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings, you must keep a guarded check upon\r\nyour feelings, so as not to let your knowledge become apparent in the\r\nsmallest degree. She will, eventually, be twice as well pleased if she\r\nfancies she has had your first fruits. Before you leave I shall give you\r\nsome short hints as to how to conduct yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this time I was getting rampageous, so begging her to stoop forward\r\nupon a stump, I tilted up her petticoats and fucked her from behind,\r\nfrigging her delicious clitoris, and making her spend at the same time\r\nas myself. It was a hasty fly, but very sweet nevertheless, for we were\r\nboth conscious that it was necessary to make the most of the short time\r\nI had yet to remain at home. I mentioned my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s remark about having\r\nno rod at hand, and it was agreed that Miss Frankland should put one on\r\nan upper shelf of her wardrobe, and accidently leave the key in the\r\ndoor. As this wardrobe remained in the room uncle and aunt were sleeping\r\nin, woman\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was sure to induce an examination of it. This\r\nanswered a double purpose, for Miss F. so arranged things that some\r\nexcellent books full of little bits of paper inserted here and there, at\r\nhighly moral or religious passages, led both uncle and aunt to have a\r\nvery high idea of her moral character\xe2\x80\x94for these were works that\r\napparently could only be for her own private reading.\r\n\r\nThe rod was placed, and the bait laid next day. Meanwhile, that\r\nafternoon, the doctor called me aside, and put me through a\r\nconversational sort of examination. I was studiously modest, but being\r\nvery fairly grounded by the admirable system of teaching pursued by Miss\r\nFrankland, I not only satisfied him, but he took occasion to compliment\r\nMiss Frankland very highly for the admirable groundwork she had laid. I\r\nfancied also, as he continued in conversation with her, that he grew\r\nmore kindly and unctuous, as if the spirit of lust was infusing itself\r\nin his veins, as he continued to converse with and gaze on that most\r\nengaging and lust-creating creature.\r\n\r\nThat night I watched, as before, their preparations for sleep, and heard\r\ntheir conversation. This time the doctor was profuse in his praise of\r\nme, but aunt thought I was timid and lifeless; there seemed no spirit\r\nabout me, as there ought to be, she added, at his age, but this\r\neducation by females makes girls of boys. I thought to myself, I guess,\r\nI shall very soon undeceive you on that point, my dear aunt. The doctor\r\nwent quietly to bed; aunt stripped and used the bidet, giving me a most\r\nexciting and voluptuous view of all her full-blown charms. No sooner was\r\nher light out, and she in bed, than I slipped out and crept up to my\r\nsisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, where three randy cunts were impatiently awaiting my\r\nadvent with an equally randy and inflamed pego. We indulged in every\r\ncomplicated combination of lust and lubricity, and never ceased until\r\ndaylight forced my unwilling retreat. Before leaving, as the rod was to\r\nbe put in the wardrobe, and the key left in the door, it was arranged\r\nthat the next night the girls, and Miss F., too, if she could, were to\r\nendeavour to sleep soundly before I came. For if our stratagem\r\nsucceeded, I should remain to see the result which would probably occupy\r\nmore than an hour or two, and I would awaken them by applying Moses\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrod to their water courses as doubtless I would be in a rampageous\r\nstate, if our expectations of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s and aunt\xe2\x80\x99s tendencies that\r\nway were realised.\r\n\r\nI kept myself awake until aunt and uncle came to bed, and then I\r\nimmediately placed myself _en vedette_. At first no notice was taken of\r\nthe key being in the lock. Aunt continued her operations, and uncle\r\nbecame somewhat more tentative than usual, when aunt, finding by placing\r\nher hand on his prick that it was mere useless desire, rose and scolded\r\nhim. He grew more emboldened, and followed her up, wishing to feel her\r\nsplendid cunt. It so happened she had drawn back as far as the wardrobe\r\nitself, until the key actually hurt her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh what have we here?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and then turning round, said that as\r\nthe key had been left in the lock, there could be no harm in looking in.\r\nHer husband became as curious as she. Of course, the first things they\r\nsaw were the prearranged books. They were seized upon with avidity\r\nprobably with the expectation of finding something smutty, but to their\r\nsurprise, and especially that of the doctor, it was quite the reverse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should never have thought this; do you know, my dear, I had\r\nbegun to suspect that, under a demure exterior, there was lurking an\r\nenormous deal of animal passion in that Miss Frankland, but if so, these\r\nworks prove that it is under complete regulation. More\xe2\x80\x99s the pity, for\r\nshe is made for the real enjoyment of the passions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you have been speculating in that quarter, have you, you old\r\nlecher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, you know we have both liberty to stray now and then, and\r\nyou, yourself, have not a little availed yourself on our mutual\r\nunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, doctor, you are too bad; do I not quite overlook all your weakness\r\nfor the younger members of your own sex, and do I not lend myself to\r\nyour fantasies in that way, when chance deprives you of any opportunity\r\nof pederasty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, my love, I was not upbraiding you, you are too dear and too\r\nkind to me to permit of anything beyond a joking allusion; but what have\r\nwe here? A birch rod! by all that is holy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReaching up to the high shelf, he drew down the rod. At first they\r\nsuspected Miss Frankland operating on herself, but the perfectly\r\nuntouched state of the rod proved that it was there in reserve only, and\r\nhad not yet been used.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lucky chance,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall now be able to birch you\r\ninto something like a fit state to fuck me\xe2\x80\x94and you shall birch me\r\nafterwards, if it will only produce a second fuck, back or front,\r\nwhichever you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an angel, my darling wife, and I shall try to content both\r\norifices; it is an abominable shame that with such a gloriously made\r\nmagnificent woman as God has given me in your noble form, I should ever\r\nrequire any other stimulant than a glance at your exquisitely exciting\r\nproportions; but I suppose it is age that weakens our sensibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, my dear John, for I, who used to think your dear old\r\ncock was enough for me, find I require the excitement of younger ones to\r\ngive me the real excess of pleasure my constitution demands; it would be\r\na shame if I did not humour all your little caprices, when you so\r\nreadily throw opportunities in my way. I only wish this nephew of mine\r\nhad been more worthy of us, we should have made him a glorious _bonne\r\nbouche_ between us, equally to his satisfaction as to ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, the air of Kent, and more manly treatment, may yet\r\ndevelop his somewhat stinted growth, and under your tuition, he may yet\r\nprove not so bad an object as you seem to think, at all events, he may\r\nserve as a _pis aller_, until a better turns up; but you must proceed\r\nwith caution, for he seems as modest as a maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear John, your modest ones always make the best, when once broken\r\nin. I only wish his physique had been more to my liking, but we shall\r\nsee, we shall see; meanwhile let us both strip to the buff, and proceed\r\nto make the most of this happy discovery of the rod\xe2\x80\x94the very thing we\r\nmost wanted and wished for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt rapidly twisted up her magnificent tresses, and as rapidly stripped\r\nto the skin; the doctor likewise. I assure you he was a well-made,\r\nmuscular, portly, handsome man, with a large well-filled pair of cods.\r\nHis pego still hung down his head, but had a certain amount of size,\r\ndoubtless stimulated by the exciting nature of their conversation and\r\nreminiscences. His skin and his cock were beautifully white, and the\r\nball of his prick of a tempting scarlet. I felt at the moment that, if I\r\ndared, I would have bolted into the room, and sucked it into such a\r\nstiffness as would have instantly satisfied the insatiable cunt of my\r\nglorious aunt. This was a delight to be left for a future day, when I\r\nallowed the doctor all the credit and pleasure of persuading me to do\r\nthat which I was burning with desire to do. But I digress. No sooner\r\nwere both fully prepared than my aunt, in a stern voice, ordered the\r\ndoctor to approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, sir, I must whip you, you have not done your duty as you\r\nought lately, and you are a very naughty boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, putting on the air of a schoolboy, begged to be excused this\r\ntime, but his inexorable mistress was not to be moved, and seizing him\r\nby the arm, pulled him over her broad and massive thighs, and with one\r\narm round his waist, seized his cock in her hand, and began whacking\r\naway at his backside in such real earnest and, apparently, with all the\r\nforce of her powerful arm, that I began to think the doctor must cry out\r\nin earnest. But he took it all without a murmur, only wriggling his fat\r\nand smooth buttocks about in a way that rather inferred satisfaction\r\nthan suffering. Presently my aunt, who, doubtless, knew by the grip of\r\nhis prick that matters had arrived at the point her own passions had\r\nmost at heart, lifted him up, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must put you in pickle, but as your great red buttocks are too\r\nlarge to be pickled, I shall pickle your prick instead. So come here,\r\nsir, and let me put this rampant fellow into my pickle tub, where, I\r\npromise, the salt brine will soon bring down his pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suppose this was the sort of childish yet lascivious talk which\r\npleased them both, for uncle, who had risen, and who now presented a\r\nmuch finer weapon than I had given him credit for, pretended to fear\r\nthis further punishment, and begged and entreated to be let off\xe2\x80\x94he had\r\nbeen punished enough, &amp;c., &amp;c. Aunt, however, leading him by the prick\r\nto the bed, threw herself on the edge, and lying back, drew up her\r\nenormous thighs almost to her belly, and showed to my gloating gaze her\r\ntremendous salmon-coloured gash, all covered with spunk, for the\r\noperation had made her spend profusely. I never saw so large a cunt, nor\r\nsuch an extensive triangle as lay on the side of each lip between it and\r\nthe commencement of the buttocks, beautifully covered with the fairest\r\ncurls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sir, is your place of punishment, stoop and kiss it before I\r\nimprison your indecent cock within it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, nothing loath, stooped and gamahuched her so well that her\r\nmighty backside wriggled beneath his head, and made everything in the\r\nroom jingle; her hand pressed his head until I thought it would have\r\nbeen pushed in altogether. At last, she spent with a shout of delight.\r\nHe hastily gobbled it all up, and rising, without more ado, thrust his\r\nstiff-standing weapon up to the hilt, I might almost say cods and all,\r\nin her longing and magnificent cunt. Here, he soaked for some minutes,\r\nand I could see by the convulsive movements of her backside how much\r\naunt was enjoying it. They soon became bent on more active movements,\r\nfor throwing her splendid legs over his back, she began an up and down\r\nmovement, much more active than I could in any way have given her credit\r\nfor. They went at it in real earnest for a longer time than I expected,\r\nbut when the mighty crisis came, it was with an energy, and passionate\r\nstruggles worthy of the strength and substance of the two love\r\nwrestlers. I could see her cunt all foam again around the roots of the\r\nincreased size of uncle\xe2\x80\x99s very respectable prick, and then they lay in\r\napparent apathy for full twenty minutes, but one could see by the\r\nconvulsive throbs of their whole bodies what delicious transports of\r\nrapture they were enjoying. Uncle was the first to rise, but only to\r\nstoop and to greedily lick up all the foaming spunk which the\r\nwide-spread entrance to her glorious cunt exhibited. This being done,\r\nshe, too, rose, and throwing her arms round the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s neck, drew his\r\nmouth to hers, and seemed to suck his slimy lips, and gain for herself\r\nas much as she could of the delicious spunk the doctor had been\r\nrevelling in. This lasted some minutes. Then my aunt turned him down on\r\nthe bed, and took a long suck at his prick, now hanging limp, but still\r\nof a goodly thickness. Then she thanked him for the great satisfaction\r\nhe had given her, and declared it was almost as good as the first days\r\nof their union. Then after toying and cuddling on the bed for a time,\r\nshe said they must now proceed to a little further castigation, on her\r\nbottom this time, as he had promised to give her a double dose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my love, but you know you promised I should take my choice of\r\nwhich temple I should make my sacrifice at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own John, you know, that after being once well fucked, the hinder\r\nhole is my preference, that is understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey accordingly rose, and uncle, furnishing himself with the rod,\r\ndesired aunt to kneel on the edge of the bed, and present her\r\nmagnificent backside projecting out fair for his birching. This she\r\nimmediately did, and being directly before my eyes, I had a full front\r\nview of her gloriously large wide open cunt, and all the pinky brown\r\n_aureola_ around her charming bottom-hole, over which the little fair\r\nringlets showed in great beauty. I need not say that my own John Thomas\r\nwas in all the pride and panoply of prickdom, and ready to burst with\r\nexcitement. My uncle took the rod in hand as soon as aunt was in\r\nposition, and placing himself on one side, while his left hand passed\r\nunder her belly to frig her clitoris, he had his right hand free to\r\ninflict any amount of whipping. And, I must say, neither one nor the\r\nother spared the rod; they laid it on right soundly, but drew forth no\r\nword or sign of complaint. My aunt soon began to wriggle her stupendous\r\nbackside, in a way to show how very exciting the birching was to her.\r\nHer exquisitely creamy white skin began to see the scarlet of the blood\r\nrushing to the surface under the infliction received. The redder it\r\nbecame, so did the evident palpitating movement of her two resplendent\r\norbs increase, until uncle, too, showed how the glorious sight was\r\nstimulating his less easily excited system, by the stiffening and\r\nuprising of his pego. Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s hand slipped down to it, and being well\r\nacquainted with its habits, pronounced it to be as equally ready as\r\nherself. Turning her body lengthways, but still on her knees, the doctor\r\nscrambled up behind her, and first stooping, licked up the foam on her\r\ncunt, for she had already spent once; and then, rolling his tongue about\r\nthe beautiful indentation leading to her delicious bottom-hole, he\r\nthrust it in as far as he could there. Then rising on his knees, he\r\nfirst plunged his jolly good prick into her cunt for two or three\r\nshoves, and then drawing it out well lubricated, presented its point to\r\nher exquisite bottom-hole, and plunged it up to the hilt at a single\r\nthrust. Aunt gave a cry and shudder of delight as she felt it penetrate\r\nto her very entrails. The doctor, satisfied for the moment, lay soaking\r\nin the exquisite pressure that aunt\xe2\x80\x99s _sphincter ani_ was applying to\r\nhis happy prick. He looked down upon her glorious buttocks, handling\r\nthem with evident pleasure. I saw aunt\xe2\x80\x99s hand steal down to her cunt,\r\nand could observe that she was actively frigging her clitoris. She\r\nshortly cried out to uncle not to be so idle, but to commence the\r\ndelicious movements she expected from him.\r\n\r\nHe did\xe2\x80\x94they did; and such a scene of excitement it was to see so\r\nmagnificent a woman with such a mighty backside in all the agonies of\r\nenjoyment that I could hold out no longer, but seizing my bursting prick\r\nin my hand, two or three rapid movements up and down, and tight\r\ngraspings of the shaft, brought on the ecstatic rapture of so lascivious\r\na spend that I actually fainted and fell heavily on the floor. It was\r\nfortunate that aunt and uncle were so hotly engaged that an earthquake\r\nmight have shook the house without their being conscious of it. So as I\r\nonly fell from my knees it never disturbed one moment of their pleasure.\r\nI must have been some minutes without consciousness, for when I came to\r\nmy senses, and was able to resume my inspection, I found their crisis\r\nwas past, but that uncle still lay soaking in the narrow cell he so\r\ndelightfully occupied. He was gazing with evident pleasure on the still\r\npalpitating buttocks of the divine backside immediately below him.\r\nNeither was in any hurry, but they dwelt for a considerable space of\r\ntime in this repose of lubricity. At last, his cock, reduced in bulk,\r\nslipped out of its close quarters. Then, rising, and helping aunt out of\r\nbed, they warmly embraced each other, kissed and tongued, and aunt\r\nthanked him for a most rapturous fuck. Aunt then sat down on her bidet,\r\nand uncle used the wash basin. After purifying themselves, and aunt\r\nshowing all the extraordinary fine development of her glorious form,\r\nthey put on their nightdresses, blew out the lights, and tumbled into\r\nbed. I immediately hastened to gain my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 room, with my cock\r\nstanding stiffer than ever. I entered gently\xe2\x80\x94they were all asleep. My\r\ntwo sisters lay reversed, with their heads between each pair of thighs;\r\nthey had evidently fallen asleep after a mutual gamahuche in the very\r\nattitude in which they had spent. Miss Frankland had apparently waited\r\nfor me, but feeling drowsy, had thrust her very fine hairy backside\r\nright out of bed, ready to attract my attention the moment I should\r\ncome. So gently approaching, and bringing the light to bear on the\r\nbeautiful sight, I spit upon and lubricated the end of my prick, and\r\nvery gently introduced him into her ever delicious cunt. I managed to\r\nfully engulph it before applying my finger to her bottom-hole, and my\r\nother hand to her clitoris. She had already in her sleep involuntarily\r\nsqueezed me with her usual force. Then, suddenly applying all my\r\nenergies, I began an active movement, which instantly awoke her. She was\r\nas ready for the sport as I was, and in a very few minutes we ran a most\r\nrapturous course of intense delight, and spent with an energy which\r\nproved the strength of the excitement I had been under. As I was\r\nstanding by the bedside, and she lying on it with her fine bottom\r\nprojecting beyond the edge, it was not a position to remain long in;\r\nbesides, I was still dressed. So, withdrawing, I undressed myself. My\r\nsisters had slept through all this, so first preparing everything for an\r\nexcessive orgie, by getting out dildoes and birch rods, we awoke the two\r\ndarlings, who, rising, stripped to the buff. The three dear creatures\r\nwere all curiosity to know what had kept me so long\xe2\x80\x94more than two hours\r\nand a half, and what had been done.\r\n\r\nI recounted all the proceedings, except in so far as they had talked of\r\ninitiating me, for neither Miss Frankland nor I wished my sisters to be\r\nacquainted with that matter. They laughed heartily, and little Lizzie\r\nsaid she must act aunt, first flog me and be fucked; then be flogged by\r\nme, and have my darling prick up her bottom-hole to follow. We laughed\r\nand humoured her, and that scene came off with considerable _eclat_.\r\nMiss Frankland fucking Mary, for whom she had a great letch, in the cunt\r\nfirst, and in the bottom, after my example on Lizzie, in the second\r\nplace. Lizzie and I then laved our parts and prepared for fresh\r\nencounters, and we then began a more regular course of the most\r\nlascivious lubricity, in which dildoes and rods played conspicuous\r\nparts, both becoming necessary under the excessive indulgencies of these\r\nlast few nights. I stole to my room long after daylight, and slept\r\nsoundly for an hour or two. You may be sure our lessons were of the\r\nlightest in these few days that were left us, and I was allowed to doze\r\noff during school hours.\r\n\r\nMiss Frankland again walked with me alone in the garden, to give me, as\r\nshe thought, last lessons in the way I should act with aunt, who she now\r\nfelt more certain than ever would very soon attack and carry my person\r\nwhen she reached home and had the place and time all to herself. I\r\nlistened with apparently great attention; as the reader knows, I was\r\nalready an adept in the art she wished to indoctrinate\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the\r\nadmirable advice of my ever charming real first instructress, the lovely\r\nMrs. Benson. But I could not help thinking how completely these two\r\nadmirable women had the same wisdom and knowledge of the world with\r\nwhich they were so anxious that I, too, should become conversant.\r\n\r\nThe next night the doctor and aunt went quietly to bed, the doctor\r\ndeclaring that his previous night\xe2\x80\x99s doings would prevent any more that\r\nnight. So I only had one more gaze at all aunt\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent beauties,\r\nwhich had a never failing effect on my excitable weapon, and which she\r\nsent away when her light was put out in a perfectly fit state for the\r\nwork that awaited him in my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 room. I came upon them sooner than\r\nexpected, and found the three rolled into one body, two gamahuching each\r\nother, and Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris in Mary\xe2\x80\x99s bum-hole. For a wonder\r\nthey did not hear me as I gently opened the door, and I patiently waited\r\ntill the lascivious crisis brought down a delicious spend from them all.\r\nWhen clapping my hands applaudingly, I cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! bravo! encore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so far glad, for to confess the truth the pace was telling, and I\r\nbegan to require more and more of the rod. However, we had but this and\r\nthe next night at our disposal, and the knowledge that we must soon\r\ncease our delicious orgies nerved us all to increased efforts.\r\n\r\nAgain our passions raged furiously, and broke out in spurts of foaming\r\nsperm. Every desire our lascivious lubricity could suggest was carried\r\nout to increase our pleasures or renew our exhausted resources, until\r\ntime warned us again to separate.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was no school time\xe2\x80\x94it was spent in packing and\r\npreparing for departure. My poor mother took it much to heart\xe2\x80\x94she was a\r\nmost affectionate creature, as innocent as a babe. I often wondered\r\nwhere we three got all the natural wantonness of our characters, for\r\nmamma had nothing of it. I suppose it must have come from our\r\ngrandparents, as aunt had it in the fullest degree, and was almost the\r\nequal of the adorable Miss Frankland, who only excelled her in having\r\nGreek blood in her veins, which, doubtless, accounted for the extreme\r\nheat of her lubricity. Some day I will recount the chief events of her\r\nromantic story, which she herself, in after-time, fully related to me.\r\nThe day was a sad one for us all, even sadder than the next, the actual\r\nday of departure. As often happens, the anticipation of evils is greater\r\nthan the reality when they come.\r\n\r\nThat night my aunt and the doctor had another whipping bout, but this\r\ntime she only succeeded in getting a single course out of the doctor. As\r\nbefore when all was over, I slipped away to pass the last delicious\r\nnight with the dear creatures with whom I had now carried on the most\r\nrapturous orgies for more than two years past. My sisters were rapidly\r\ndeveloping into remarkably handsome fine young women, especially Mary,\r\nwho, having the advantage of a year and a half over Lizzie, was\r\nnaturally more filled out and formed, although Lizzie promised in the\r\nend to be, and in fact became, the finest woman, and had also by far the\r\nhotter temperament of the two. We passed the night in orgies the most\r\nrefined, interspersed with tears of regret at our parting, and soft\r\nendearments leading to perfect furies of lubricity, until I was nearly\r\nfainting with exhaustion. We tore ourselves asunder with difficulty, and\r\nthe three angelic creatures held their door open, and with streaming\r\neyes watched my receding form; twice, on looking back, I could not help\r\nreturning again and again to throw myself into their arms for a last\r\nloving embrace; but like all things human it came to an end, and I\r\nreached my bed and sobbed myself to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to dwell on our parting next day. My mother accompanied\r\nus to the town where we were to take a coach. It drove up. My poor\r\nmother could hardly utter her blessing and farewell, and I saw the tears\r\ncoursing down her venerable cheeks as she waved her handkerchief before\r\nthe coach turned the corner that shut us from her view. Of course my\r\nheart was full, whose could be otherwise when quitting home for the\r\nfirst time. My aunt put her arm round my waist, and laid my head on her\r\nample bosom, and comforted me as well as she could; but a full heart\r\nmust vent itself. Fortunately, we had the inside all to ourselves. My\r\naunt was very tender, and so was the doctor. I soon sobbed myself to\r\nsleep; even in the bitter grief of the moment I had some slight comfort\r\nin the idea of pressing those glorious orbs. My aunt frequently kissed\r\nme, and I returned it with full pouting lips, which I fancied rather\r\npleased her. I slept until the coach stopped for supper, ate heartily,\r\nand, as may be supposed after my late week of hard work, soon again\r\nslept like a top.\r\n\r\nI did not awake until it was broad daylight, and, like all heavy\r\nsleepers, was awake and sensible of what was going on before opening my\r\neyes. I became conscious that a hand was gently pressing and apparently\r\ntaking the size of my standing pego, which the pressure of water on my\r\nbladder had occasioned to be in an erection of the hardest. I lay quite\r\nstill, continuing to breathe heavily, but unable to prevent sundry\r\nthrobbings of my pego, occasioned by the soft hand of my aunt, who was\r\ngently following its form from the outside of my trousers. It appeared\r\nshe had only just commenced her manipulations, not having previously\r\nobserved the bulging out of its large dimensions under my trousers. She\r\npressed her knee against that of the doctor opposite, who I presume, was\r\ndozing off, and in a whisper I heard her draw his attention to my\r\nextraordinary development.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel it, my dear, but very gently, so as not to waken him, it is the\r\nlargest prick I have ever felt, and altogether beats the late Captain of\r\nGrenadiers you used to be so jealous of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor did feel, and I think aunt would have unbuttoned my trousers,\r\nhad not the coach suddenly pulled up at the inn we were to breakfast at.\r\nSo perforce they shook me up. I acted the suddenly awakened sleeper very\r\nwell. As soon as we were out of the coach, I whispered to the doctor\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, uncle, I want to piddle very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd taking me behind some wagons in the innyard, where we would not be\r\nseen, he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, we can both piss down this grating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, forsooth, to encourage me, pulled out his own standing pego. I saw\r\nwhat he wanted, and out with my own in all its length and strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Charles, what an immense cock you have got\xe2\x80\x94does it often\r\nstand like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, uncle, every morning it hurts me so until I piddle\xe2\x80\x94it gets worse\r\nand worse, and bigger and bigger\xe2\x80\x94it was not half so big a year ago. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do to cure myself of this hardness, which is very\r\npainful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, I must speak to your aunt, perhaps she can help you. Have you\r\never spoken to anybody else about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear no! I should have been quite ashamed; but when I saw you also\r\nhad the same hardness, I was very glad to ask your advice, dear uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. Always consult me about that part of your body, whatever\r\nyou may feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted, and I could see, on regaining the coach, that uncle and\r\naunt had a satisfactory exchange of words on the subject. We got to the\r\nRectory in Kent in time for dinner, at which I was the object of great\r\nand devoted attention of both, especially of my aunt.\r\n\r\nOur previous long journey made an early retreat to bed a necessity for\r\nall of us. They both conducted me with much _empressement_ to my\r\nbedroom, a very comfortable one, having a communication at one end with\r\na corridor, and, on the right-hand side entering, another door\r\ncommunicating with my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-and bathroom, and these opening\r\ninto their bedroom, which had a similar dressing room on the other side\r\nfitted up with wardrobes for female gear, and dedicated to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsole use. I was left to a quiet night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, which I most thoroughly\r\nenjoyed, and slept profoundly until late in the morning. I was awakened\r\nby my uncle drawing all the clothes off me. Of course, I was rampant, as\r\nusual. He gazed for a moment or two without speaking at my enormous cock\r\nat full stand. He then said it was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and breakfast was\r\nready, that he had not liked to disturb me sooner, as I was in so sound\r\na slumber, but now it was time for me to get up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your doodle, as you call it, has got the\r\nhardness you spoke of yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he laid hold of it, and gently squeezed it\xe2\x80\x94it filled his grasp. He\r\nevidently enjoyed the pleasure of handling it, but contented himself\r\nwith saying that my aunt must see to giving me some remedy the next day,\r\nwhen she should come and inspect it in the morning, so as to see how\r\nhard it was, and how it hurt me.\r\n\r\nI replied that it would be very kind of aunt, but what would she think\r\nof my showing my doodle to her; mamma had told me, when I slept in her\r\nroom, always to piddle in a corner, and never let anyone see it.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at my apparent simplicity, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma was quite right as to people in general, but it is quite a\r\ndifferent thing with your aunt, whose close relationship authorises her\r\ndoing what she can to relieve her dear nephew, in whom we both take such\r\nan interest; besides, I suppose your mamma never saw it in this size and\r\nhardness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gently handling it all the time of our conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! mamma never saw it but at night, when it was quite shrunk up,\r\nand that is nearly a year ago, when I used to sleep in her room; it is\r\nsince then it has grown so large and hurts so much, and throbs so\r\nviolently as it is doing now in your hand. It makes me feel so queer,\r\ndear uncle, and I shall be so much obliged to dear auntie if she will\r\nbut give me a remedy to relieve the pain I suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed again, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall speak to your aunt, and we shall see\xe2\x80\x94we shall see; but get up\r\nnow, we shall find your aunt waiting for us. So make haste and dress;\r\ncome downstairs, you will find us in the dining room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left me, and I could hear him laughing to himself, as he walked along\r\nthe corridor, doubtless at my apparent innocent simplicity. I saw at\r\nonce that I should be called upon to show myself a man next day; but I\r\nalready felt the advantage of the advice both my admirable mistresses\r\nhad given me, as to making all new conquests believe that they had my\r\nfirst fruits. I determined to adhere to the game I was playing, and I\r\nforesaw that the pleasure of supporting such a thing would greatly\r\nenhance the delight aunt would naturally take in being fucked by my\r\nreally monstrous cock. I was soon down to breakfast, and was most warmly\r\nembraced by my gloriously beautiful aunt, who, in a graceful dishabille,\r\nlooked more charming than ever. She hugged me for more than a minute in\r\nher arms, and devoured me with kisses. I have no doubt the doctor had\r\nrecounted our interview, and by the sparkle of her eye, and the flush on\r\nher face, as she so closely embraced me, she showed that already her\r\npassions were excited, and she was longing for the hour in which she\r\ncould indulge them. However, all that day, they were kept under\r\nrestraint. The doctor had some parish business to attend to, and aunt\r\nleaving me for an hour after breakfast, while she attended to some\r\nnecessary household affairs, afterwards took me all over the house and\r\ngrounds, and then we had a walk through the village. The house was one\r\nof those snug rectory houses situated in their own grounds which abound\r\nin England, but few have so glorious a prospect as was seen from the\r\nfront of the house. Leeds, in Kent, is situated on the ridge of hills\r\nrunning east and west, and commanding views over the rich and beautiful\r\nweald of Kent. The rectory faced the south, and the ground falling\r\nrapidly beyond the garden left a splendid landscape in full view.\r\nAlthough close to the village and the church, both were planted out by a\r\nthick belt of evergreen trees, which extended to north and east,\r\nsheltering the house and grounds from every adverse wind. The house\r\nitself was very commodious, but unassuming. The south front had a large\r\nprojecting half-circle, with three windows in it and a window on each\r\nside of the half-circle; this formed the drawing room below and my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and two dressing rooms above. To the right, looking at\r\nthe house, there was a wing with an open-arched passage leading to a\r\ngreenhouse and vinery, while above ran a suite of three rooms, each with\r\none good-sized window overlooking the garden. These were the three rooms\r\nkept for the same number of young gentlemen who might be taken in for\r\npreparation for the University\xe2\x80\x94a number the doctor never exceeded. Of\r\nthese rooms I was at present the only occupant. They were built so as to\r\nbe shut off from all the rest of the house by a door on the landing,\r\nleading into the corridor, from which a door communicated with the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room, and with each of the three rooms. At the end was\r\na water closet for general use. I have already mentioned the first of\r\nthese rooms had a second door of communication with the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing room, and this was appropriated to me. Below these rooms, but\r\nlooking north, and communicating with the village by a covered way and\r\nhaving a playground into which it looked, was the schoolroom, taking up\r\nabout half the space of the rooms above. Beyond the covered way to the\r\nvillage was a quiet garden square, into which the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s study looked.\r\nThis study was separated by a passage from the schoolroom, and had\r\ndouble baize doors both on the house and schoolroom sides. It was in\r\nfact the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s sanctum sanctorum, of which more will be told in the\r\nsequel. In this manner the schoolroom part of the house was quite shut\r\noff from the rest, and was nowhere overlooked. To return to the\r\nhabitable part. The west front contained a small library, opening from\r\nthe drawing room, and beyond a comfortable dining room, communicating\r\nwith the kitchen and offices, which overlooked the courtyard of the\r\nentrance to the house, above these were the domestics\xe2\x80\x99 bedrooms, &amp;c. The\r\nentrance was from the north into a handsome entrance-hall, with a good\r\nbroad staircase leading to the upper landing, which, turning westward,\r\nled to three extra bedrooms above the library and dining room. It was\r\nthus a very convenient house and well-adapted for a clergyman adding\r\nscholastic duties to his other ministrations. I forgot to say that the\r\nfirst bedroom, in the west wing, had a door of communication with my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room, which I afterwards found had often served for\r\namorous propensities by making it the bedroom of some favoured lover.\r\nThe grounds were charmingly laid out with a profusion of flowers. There\r\nwas a perfectly shaded walk in the east shrubbery leading from the\r\ngreenhouse down to a most charming summer house overlooking the very\r\nfinest prospect, and perfectly secure from all observation. It was\r\nfurnished very appropriately for amorous purposes, the couches being\r\nlow, broad, and with patent spring-cushions. In the sequel it was the\r\nscene of many a bout of lubricity. My aunt took me through all that I\r\nhave described. When we arrived at the summer house, I could see that it\r\nwas with difficulty she restrained her great desire to possess me; I\r\nwould most willingly have rushed into her longing arms, and fucked her\r\nto her heart\xe2\x80\x99s content, but prudence withheld. I had undertaken to act a\r\npart, and must go through with it. No doubt aunt was withheld by a\r\nsimilar motive. She and the doctor had resolved that nothing to alarm my\r\nmodesty\xe2\x80\x94heaven save the mark!\xe2\x80\x94was to be attempted till the next morning.\r\nSo with a deep sigh she led me away from the summer house into the\r\nvillage, where we met the doctor, and returned to luncheon. After\r\nluncheon the doctor took me for a walk again through the picturesque\r\nvillage along the ridge of hills, to enjoy the beautiful views of Leeds\r\nCastle, the doctor giving me very many interesting historical details\r\nconnected with it. After a most pleasant and lengthened walk we returned\r\nin time to dress for dinner. I found that one of the rules of the house\r\nwas that no matter, whether alone or with company the doctor invariably\r\ninsisted on regular evening costume at dinner-time. This has many\r\nadvantages. In the first place it gives at least half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noccupation, an object in itself worth something to persons living in the\r\ncountry, and then it gives a _cachet_ or rather _chic_ to your dinner\r\nparty, however small it may be, and is in itself a certain amount of\r\nrestraint on excessive exuberance of spirits, and thus may be considered\r\nas a disciplinary element of education tending to keep up that reserve\r\nand self-restraint characteristic of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nBeyond a marked attention to me in every way, our dinner and evening\r\npassed without anything worthy of record. I was evidently high in their\r\nfavour, probably for the reason that both began to have great hopes that\r\nI would serve their purpose in every way. We retired early to rest, and\r\nI thus obtained three nights of uninterrupted rest, recruiting me after\r\nall the excesses I had indulged in before quitting home. It was so far\r\nfortunate, that I was thus ready to satisfy the strong passions of my\r\naunt, who was insatiable when once her lust was let loose. I awoke\r\nearlier than on the previous morning, and shortly afterwards, hearing a\r\nmovement in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room, I feigned sleep. It was as I\r\nexpected, the doctor coming to me in company with my aunt. They\r\napproached my bedside. I had laid myself on my back purposely to allow\r\nthe thin summer-covering to be lifted up and bulged out by my\r\nstiff-standing pego. I heard the doctor whisper to aunt, to draw her\r\nattention to it. She gently slipped her hand under the clothes, and\r\ngrasped it in her soft fat fingers, upon which it throbbed so violently\r\nthat I thought it politic to waken at once. My aunt was not at all put\r\nout, but held it still in her hand with a gentle pressure. She said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear nephew, your uncle has brought me to see if I cannot relieve\r\nthe extreme hardness and pain you feel in this immense thing of yours.\r\nLet me see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe now threw off the coverlet, and brought to light my large prick in\r\nall the glory of the stiffest stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word! what a monster!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nHer eyes sparkled, and her face flushed as the sight met her full gaze.\r\nThe doctor approached, and also handled it with evident delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, will you be able to put it into your natural warm bath? It is\r\nso very large!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I have not the slightest doubt but that I shall be able to soothe\r\nand deliver it of all pain\xe2\x80\x94poor fellow, how it throbs! Does it hurt\r\nmuch, dear Charles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; your hand seems to make it even harder than before, but, at\r\nthe same time makes me feel so very queer, as if I were going to faint.\r\nDo relieve me, dear auntie, the doctor says you can if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so, certainly, my dear boy; but the method is a great secret,\r\nknown only to your uncle and myself; and you must assure me you will\r\nnever mention it to anyone, or tell how I cured you. It is only my\r\nstrong affection for you that makes me anxious to do anything I can to\r\nrelieve you. Do you promise to be discreet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear aunt, you may be sure I shall be too much obliged to you ever\r\nto think of revealing your great kindness. Do, pray, do it at once; I\r\nfeel so queer, and I am bursting with pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, make room for me beside you, and I shall lie down; the\r\ndoctor will cover us up, and I shall soon reduce the stiffness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got into bed, lay down on her back, pulled the sheet over us, laying\r\nbare her splendid belly, and, at the same time, opening her magnificent\r\nlimbs and desiring me to get upon her, telling me she had a sheath in\r\nher body, which, when my hard doodle was put within, would soon relieve\r\nit of its stiffness. I got awkwardly upon her. She seized my standing\r\nprick, and placing its knob between the already very moist lips, told me\r\nto push it in as far as it would go. It glided into its delicious sheath\r\nup to the cod piece in a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9chow nice! Dear, dear, auntie, what shall I do\r\nnow, I feel as if I were going to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy apparent innocence seemed to add to her pleasure. She threw the sheet\r\nthat covered us on one side, and with arms and legs clasped round my\r\nbody, begged me to move my bottom up and down, so as to make my doodle\r\ngo in and out. I followed her directions, and she seconded me with rare\r\nart, squeezing my instrument with wonderful pressures as I withdrew and\r\nshe retired, to meet again the up and down shock with the most\r\nlascivious delight. I felt the hand of the doctor embracing my testicles\r\nand gently pressing them. I became aware that the crisis was\r\napproaching, and shoved home with a cry of rapture, but remembering my\r\npart, I exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am dying, dear aunt; oh! oh! stop! stop! I\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI sank away, but could hear aunt murmuring\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, darling, delicious boy, I never had such a glorious prick in me,\r\nor a better fuck before. I fear the dear child has fainted from the\r\nexcess of pleasure, and the newness of the sensation, but his glorious\r\nprick still throbs deliciously within me\xe2\x80\x94only feel its root, doctor, how\r\nstiff it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt the doctor grasping it, making it throb violently as he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear boy is as stiff as ever. You will get another fuck out of him\r\nthe moment he comes to himself. I am glad of that, for it is delightful\r\nto see you at it, especially with so splendid a prick operating upon\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94it is the greatest treat you have ever given me in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at that, my dear, for I never met with such a fine prick\r\nin my life before, and little thought my nephew could have had such a\r\nsplendid one in his trousers when we first saw him. Oh, I am lewder than\r\never, and am spen\xe2\x80\x94spen\xe2\x80\x94spending. Oh!\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she poured down another copious hot flow on my enraptured prick. I\r\nlet her revel in the ecstasies of her second lascivious discharge until\r\nI found that her libidinous passions were again excited and longing for\r\nmore active operations. I pretended not to know where I was, and began a\r\nfaltering\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, where am I? What has happened? I have been in paradise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLifting up my head, I apparently recognised aunt in surprise\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear; how came I here? Oh, remember, auntie, you promised to\r\nrelieve my hardness, and it seemed so nice, but I feel it is harder than\r\never; you will try and relieve me again, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear auntie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my dear nephew, you must do as you did at first, move in and\r\nout, and I shall second you; and perhaps we shall succeed this time\r\nbetter than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, I was less gauche, and she more energetic. I felt the doctor\r\ninsert a moistened finger up my fundament, and move it in unison with\r\nour thrusts. Aunt cried out to me to go on faster and faster, and we\r\nsoon came to the grand crisis, dying away together in sobs and sighs of\r\ndelighted enjoyment. I again sank on her noble panting bosom, really\r\novercome with the rapture-giving delights of that most delicious cunt.\r\nOn lifting my love-humid eyes to the face of my aunt, she seized my head\r\nin both hands, and drew my lips to her in a long, long kiss of satisfied\r\nlust, and thrust her tongue into my mouth, which I immediately sucked.\r\nShe then begged me to give her mine. After tongueing together for a\r\nminute or two she asked if my doodle was in less pain, and if its\r\nhardness was reduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little, dear auntie, but I feel it is getting hard again\xe2\x80\x94you must try\r\nonce more, if you please\xe2\x80\x94oh! it is so nice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd my prick throbbed up and stiffened to prove the truth of my words.\r\nBut the doctor here interrupted us by saying that he must have his own\r\nstiffness reduced, at the same time presenting his really fine prick at\r\nfull stand before our faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must get up, my dear boy, and your aunt will allay your new\r\nhardness in another way, in which she will be able to relieve both our\r\nhardnesses together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReluctantly I rose, withdrawing my reeking prick at more than half\r\nstand. Looking down as I rose on the truly large and magnificent foaming\r\ngash from which I had just withdrawn, I cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear aunt, what a wonderful sight it is; I must kiss it for the\r\nefforts it has made to relieve me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI threw my head down upon it, kissed it, licked its wide open lips all\r\nfoaming with fuck as they were, thrusting my tongue in as far as it\r\nwould go. This evidently gave aunt great delight. But the doctor drew me\r\noff, told me to lie down on my back, and made aunt straddle over me. She\r\ntook hold of my now completely standing prick, bent it back, and\r\ndirecting it aright, sank upon it until her ample bush of hair lay\r\ncrushed on mine. She rose up and down two or three times in a slow\r\ndelicious movement, and then bending forward, glued her lips to mine\r\nwhile I threw my arms round her glorious body.\r\n\r\nI could feel the doctor getting up between my legs on his knees, and\r\nthen felt his prick was rubbing against the lips of the cunt fully\r\ndistended round my large pego, doubtless for the purpose of lubricating\r\nit before thrusting it into aunt\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent backside. I felt the\r\nrubbing of his prick against mine through the thin partition, as he\r\nglided slowly up into her entrails. We then began our joint movements,\r\nbut aunt beat us both, and spent twice before joining in our final\r\nfinish, which was ushered in by loud cries of delight from all three as\r\nthe death-like ecstasy seized us, and we sank in that half unconscious\r\nstate of supreme bliss. It was some time before any of us spoke a word.\r\nThe doctor rose first, and without drawing his prick from the delicious\r\norifice in which it had been engulphed, showed by the way it hung down\r\nits pendant head, that aunt had at all events allayed its stiffness. He\r\ndesired aunt to rise also, but I felt by her throbbing cunt, and the\r\npressure she put on my prick, as she rose from it, so that it came out\r\nwith a loud flop, that she would fain once more have done me the service\r\nof allaying any stiffness that might re-arise. However, it was much\r\nlimper than before, although still of a goodly thickness. When she got\r\non her legs, she stooped forward, kissed it, took it in her mouth, and\r\nmost lovingly sucked it, saying how delighted she would be to relieve me\r\nwhenever it was troublesome. They begged me to get up and dress, and we\r\nshould meet at breakfast. They then withdrew, to complete their own\r\ntoilets. I lay for some minutes in the dreamy delight of thinking over\r\nthe delicious event that had just taken place, and amused at the last\r\nremark of my aunt, which seemed to infer that she thought I was innocent\r\nof the real meaning of the performances that had just taken place. I\r\ndetermined to act as if it were so.\r\n\r\nWe met at breakfast, aunt kissed me most lovingly. I thanked her for her\r\ngreat kindness in relieving me from pain in so delicious a manner, and\r\ntold her I could not help loving her more than I had ever loved anyone\r\nbefore, and said I hoped she would kindly relieve me every morning, for\r\nI always suffered at that time from the painful hardness, though I\r\nshould never be sorry for that, as long as she would so kindly allay it.\r\nI put my hands quite in a childish way on each cheek, and held up my\r\nmouth for a kiss, which was given to me in the lewdest way. She called\r\nme her dear boy, and told me that she would always help me as she had\r\ndone that morning, as long as she found I was discreet, and never told\r\nhow she did so. You may be sure that my promises were most earnestly\r\nreiterated. So we kissed again, and sat down to an excellent breakfast\r\nwith sharpened appetites from our early exercise, and did full justice\r\nto the viands set before us. The doctor gave me a book of history, and\r\ndesired me to read for a couple of hours, and said that at luncheon we\r\nwould talk over the subject of my reading. I studied attentively for the\r\ntime prescribed, and then aunt came to ask me to walk in the grounds\r\nwith her. Insensibly or not, she led me to the summer house, and sat\r\ndown on a low ottoman. I sat down beside her. She drew me to her, kissed\r\nme, and clasped me to her bosom, murmuring terms of endearment, and\r\npressing me to her glorious bubbies. Of course, my unruly member fired\r\nup at once. To prevent her imagining it was lasciviousness that prompted\r\nme, I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear aunt, I do so want to piddle, my doodle at once gets as\r\nhard as wood if I at all restrain the inclination to do so, just feel\r\nhow stiff it has become; will you let me go and piddle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, I will go with you, and unbutton your trousers for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went among the trees. Her busy fingers undid my trousers, and helped\r\nto bring forward my lordly cock in its glory. Fortunately, I did want to\r\npiddle, and aunt held it up as I did so, her eyes sparkling with lust as\r\nshe handled it, and her face flushed with her excited passions. She\r\nremarked what an astonishing size it was, gently rubbing it up and down.\r\nOf course, it became more rampant than ever. Throwing my arms round her\r\nstooping neck, I asked her if she could not again relieve the excessive\r\nhardness and pain it was in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, my dear boy. Come here again into the summer house, where\r\nwe cannot be observed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe entered. She put a cushion on the floor for my knees, threw herself\r\non her back, and lifted all her petticoats well over her belly, exposing\r\nher very hairy cunt, and its splendid pinky gash, already moist from her\r\nexcitement. I threw myself on my knees, and stooping down, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must kiss the dear reliever of my pains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kissed and tongued, until my aunt begged me to raise my body, and come\r\nupon her, that she might quickly put me out of pain. I rose, and slipped\r\nmy stiff member up to the hilt in her longing cunt almost taking away\r\nher breath by the suddenness and completeness of the insertion. Her legs\r\nand arms were round me in a moment, and at it we went hammer and tongs,\r\nuntil we quickly spent with cries of delight, and sank in momentary\r\noblivion, soon to recover our full sensations, and dash again on\r\npassion\xe2\x80\x99s furious course, this time aunt pouring down her hot boiling\r\ndischarge before me, and again when she felt the torrent of my sperm\r\nshooting up to the top of her womb. Our final crisis was even more\r\necstatic than the first time, and we lay longer in the soft languor of\r\nthe after-sensations. The excessively voluptuous nature of her inward\r\npressures soon re-illuminated all my libidinous desires, and refired my\r\nprick with renewed force. We soaked for a short time, each indulging in\r\nthe delicious inward throbbings, until our lust could stand no longer\r\nsuch mere preliminary work, and stimulated anew, we rushed with\r\nfreshened passions into the fray. The fiery nature of my lustful aunt\r\npaid down two tributes to Priapus to my one. This time our sensations\r\nwere so ecstatic in spending that we really lost all consciousness, and\r\nlay for long locked in the closest embrace. I could feel that we were\r\nboth becoming re-excited, but my aunt begged me to rise, saying that was\r\nenough for the present, the stiffness was allayed, and my weight was too\r\nmuch for her to endure longer. I rose, but again buried my face in the\r\nwide gash of that glorious cunt, and before rising completely, I licked\r\nup the delicious foam, and even ventured to give, as it were, an\r\naccidental lick to her little knob of a clitoris, for she was not much\r\ndistinguished in that way; she shivered with excitement, when I touched\r\nit, and even pressed my head down upon it, when she felt the pleasure\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, what exquisite delight you give me! Continue for a little\r\nto keep moving your tongue on that hard projection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so. Her splendid backside wriggled below in the fullest enjoyment.\r\nShe rapidly came to the ecstatic ending, nearly thrusting my whole face\r\ninto her vast orbit, and spurting out a very torrent of sperm, all over\r\nmy face and neck. She seized me by the shoulders to draw me up, that she\r\nmight kiss me. My prick had regained its full vigour, and could not fail\r\nto slip in of itself into that most lascivious and gaping cunt when it\r\nreached the entrance. My aunt started at such an unexpected result, but\r\nwas too much gratified to hesitate for an instant. Throwing legs and\r\narms around me, her supple loins were in immediate action. I myself was\r\nequally in a state of wild lubricity, so that our course was even more\r\nrapid than at first, and we both spent and sank together in the\r\ndelicious after-languor as soon as the ecstatic joy of the first rush of\r\nthe exquisite discharge was over. My aunt, who could not but be most\r\nhighly gratified, still kept up the appearance of relieving me, she\r\ndesired me to rise, and said we must go, as luncheon time was at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my darling nephew, you must yourself endeavour to keep down your\r\nhardness, and not allow it to become stiff so often\xe2\x80\x94you will injure me\r\nwith your violence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling aunt, you give me relief with such exquisite pleasure\r\nthat my doodle seems to harden only for the purpose of your relieving\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94see how it is again bulging out of my trousers,\xe2\x80\x9d for she had buttoned\r\nit up. She put her hand upon it, and squeezed it, but said, with a deep\r\nsigh\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, come along, or I do not know what might happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew me away, but by the manner in which she squeezed my arm, I\r\ncould feel she was herself still greatly excited. Her prudence alone\r\nenabled her to resist further indulgence, as she seemed to think I was\r\nstill unaware of the real nature of our proceedings. We found the doctor\r\nwaiting for us at the luncheon table. He guessed by the flushed face of\r\nmy aunt the nature of our late employment, and asked if I had been again\r\ntroubled with my unnatural hardness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears that whenever he wants to\r\npiddle, and cannot do so at once, it troubles him in that way, and I\r\nhave had some difficulty in allaying it. I succeeded at last, but I have\r\ntold my dear nephew that he must endeavour himself to restrain it in the\r\ndaytime, as it is not always in my power to relieve him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, my love; my dear Charles, you must endeavour to follow the\r\nwishes of your aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I promised, and with such a look of innocence that I could see\r\nthey exchanged smiles at it. We sat down to luncheon. Afterwards the\r\ndoctor, seating himself by my side, began a conversation on the\r\nhistorical subject I had been studying. Our conversation became really\r\nvery interesting. The doctor was a man of great erudition, and of varied\r\nknowledge, and had a manner, special to himself, of making almost any\r\nsubject most interesting. Hours flew by, and it was only when aunt\r\nentered about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, to take a cup of tea, as was her wont, that\r\nwe were aware how time had flown. The doctor praised my knowledge of\r\nhistory, and the pertinency of the questions I had put to him, in a\r\nmanner highly flattering to me, and I could see that I had risen much in\r\nhis estimation, quite apart from any erotic influences. He proposed a\r\nconstitutional walk before dinner, and much interested me by his\r\ninstructive conversation during it. Our dinner was most agreeable. In\r\nthe drawing room aunt, a most admirable performer on the piano,\r\nenchanted us with her skill and taste. The doctor challenged me to a\r\ngame at chess. He was, of course, far superior to me, but he praised my\r\nstyle of play, saying I should become a great proficient with time and\r\npractice. We retired, as usual, about half-past ten, the doctor seeing\r\nme to my room, and promising to bring aunt in the morning to see if I\r\nwas still troubled with that painful hardness. I thanked him warmly, but\r\nwith much simplicity, as if quite unaware of the real nature of the\r\napplication of the remedy. He left me to my repose. The quiet nights of\r\nsound sleep made my day efforts pass off without any exhaustion, and I\r\nfelt my erotic powers increasing in force.\r\n\r\nI slept soundly, and so long that I was only awakened by the caressing\r\nhand of my aunt on my stiff-standing pego. She had gently lifted off all\r\nthe coverings, and I lay quite exposed to eye and touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling aunt! how kind of you to come this early to relieve that\r\ntroublesome thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held out my arms. She stooped down to kiss me. I clasped her to my\r\nbosom. Our lips met, and our tongues darted fiery lust into our bodies.\r\nShe threw herself down by my side, I was onto her in a moment. The\r\ndoctor took hold of my pego, and guided it into the delicious orbit of\r\nhis wife. Dear aunt begged me to do as I did yesterday, if I wanted\r\nrelief. Our action became fast and furious. Her legs and arms wound\r\nround me in loving pressures. Her active backside wriggled in delight.\r\nThe doctor had introduced first one finger, and then two, into my\r\nfundament, and added greatly to the fury of my lust, so that I spent in\r\nan agony of pleasure, as quickly as the fiery lust of my aunt produced\r\nher hot and plentiful discharge. I sank on her charming bosom, panting\r\nwith the force and fury of our coition, but like all very fast fucking,\r\nmy virile member hardly flinched from his first vigour, and a very few\r\nof aunt\xe2\x80\x99s exquisitely delicious internal pressures sufficed to bring him\r\nup to the fullest stiffness. We were about to plunge again with renewed\r\nardour into all love\xe2\x80\x99s wildest excitement, but the doctor insisted upon\r\nour first changing places, that he, too, might have his hardness\r\nallayed. Our change of position was instantly accomplished, and dear\r\naunt, after impaling herself on my upright member, sank on my bosom and\r\nwas clasped in my longing arms. The doctor scrambled up behind her, and\r\nlost no time in sheathing himself in her fine and beautiful bottom-hole,\r\nand then we ran a double course of delight, dear aunt taking the lead as\r\nusual, and deluging us with her hot and delicious discharges before we\r\nwere ready to pour into her a double dose of delight, which again made\r\nher spend with fury and cries of rapturous enjoyment, in which we both\r\njoined, and then sank in love\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite inanimation. On recovering\r\nourselves the doctor withdrew, but I was already as stiff as before.\r\nAunt began a most effective and delicious movement above me, which soon\r\nbrought on another grand finale, and we died away in mutual delight. I\r\ncould feel that the doctor was gently handling my cods, both during and\r\nafter our last combat. When, by our mutual throbbings, he saw that we\r\nwere about to become fit to enter on another career, he begged his wife\r\nto rise from off me. But the idea of losing her and her extra pressures\r\nmade my prick immediately resume an erect position, so that when she\r\nrose from off it, it was shown in a completely standing state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! again, Charles?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cYour member is sadly unruly.\r\nMy dear, you must again try to allay it, but put yourself this time on\r\nyour knees, and we shall see if that position be better adapted for the\r\npurpose of relieving this immense object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gently and admiringly handling it all the time. His wife was\r\nquite aware of his object, and, indeed, so was I. Our last bout had\r\nhelped to restiffen his prick, and although not yet quite rampant, it\r\nwas evident that when my bottom was in full view, and so placed as to be\r\ngot at with facility, it would be quite as stiff as necessary. When his\r\nwife had knelt down, and by lowering her head had exposed all the\r\nwondrous grandeur of the most superb backside that ever met my eyes, my\r\nprick bounded with joy. The doctor still grasping it, and feeling it\r\nthrob so wildly, saw that his game was sure. He pointed out all the\r\nbeauty of aunt\xe2\x80\x99s second orbit of love, and told me it was in that he had\r\nallayed his own hardness, and as the other orifice had not succeeded in\r\nquieting me, he recommended my entering within the narrow path of\r\necstasy. I professed no surprise, but seemed to take it quite as a\r\nmatter of course in the simplest innocence of manner. Uncle continued to\r\nhandle my tool as I mounted on my knees behind aunt. Guiding the almost\r\nbursting weapon into the delicious cunt in the first place, to be\r\nlubricated there, and then telling me to withdraw it, he directed it to\r\nthe smaller orifice, and desired me to push gently and smoothly in. It\r\nglided in slowly up to the meeting of my belly against the enormous\r\nbuttocks of that sublime backside. There I paused for a minute or two\r\nwithin the throbbing sheath. Aunt had pushed her bottom well out, and by\r\nthe action of apparently voiding, had facilitated the entrance. She\r\nwinced once or twice, but on the whole, as she told me afterwards, took\r\nin my enormous tool with less difficulty than she expected. After a few\r\nslow movements, during with I caressed and devoured with admiration the\r\nglorious orbs beneath my dearest gaze, uncle desired me to lean forward\r\nand embrace my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s splendid bosom. As soon as I did this, and began\r\nslowly to thrust in and out of the delicious sheath in which I was so\r\nrapturously engulphed, I felt uncle\xe2\x80\x99s hands wandering over my buttocks,\r\nfollowed by the introduction of two fingers into my anus. My throbbings\r\non them showed how much he pleased me. He asked if it added to the\r\npleasure I was enjoying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, dear uncle, immensely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cas I, too, am suffering from hardness, I shall try to\r\nallay it in your bottom, as you are doing in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s; don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\r\nif I hurt you I shall stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo just as you like, dear uncle, both you and aunt are so kind as to do\r\nall you can to relieve my pain, and I should be very ungrateful if I did\r\nnot do all in my power to relieve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a darling boy, and I shall love you dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knelt behind me, and spitting on his cock, presented it at my\r\nbum-hole, and pressing gently forward, soon sheathed it to the utmost\r\ndepth. He did not hurt me at all, as I was too much used to be dildoed\r\nthere to have felt any difficulty of approach, but I deemed it politic\r\nto beg him to be gentle from time to time, as if it were a virgin vale\r\nhe was entering. He fancied as much, and that was just as good. When\r\nonce he was fully within, after a few throbs, which were felt most\r\ndeliciously on his delighted prick, we proceeded to more active work.\r\nAunt, in the meantime, by more pressure on my prick, and by frigging her\r\nown clitoris, which I was quite aware she was doing, had spent\r\nprofusely; and, as the case with all the mucous membranes of the body\r\nwhich sympathise with the cunt\xe2\x80\x99s discharge, her bottom-hole became quite\r\nmoist and deliciously heated. The doctor and I then went at it with\r\nfiery force, and soon gave down nature\xe2\x80\x99s tribute, and mutually poured a\r\nflood of sperm up the entrails we were respectively belabouring.\r\n\r\nWe lay for some time after in all the luxury of soaking in the delicious\r\napertures. I fell to nothing, and reluctantly withdrew. I had again\r\nbecome rampant, and keeping myself more erect, with a hand on either\r\nimmense hip, I devoured with greedy eyes all the glories beneath my\r\ngaze. Fired by such a truly magnificent sight as these huge buttocks\r\nwere, when in an entire state of wriggle, I again spent with cries of\r\nagonised delight, and in all the ecstasy of fully satiated lust, sank\r\nalmost insensible on the broad and beautiful back of my aunt, who\r\nherself had spent several times, squealing like a rabbit, and eventually\r\nfalling flat on her belly overcome with exhausted lust, drawing me with\r\nher still held a willing prisoner in her glorious and exquisite\r\nbottom-hole. We lay entranced for some time, until the doctor, who,\r\nduring our last bout, had purified himself, told us we must now get up.\r\nWith difficulty I tore myself from out of that delicious sheath, and\r\nrose with my cock at last pendant. The doctor congratulated me on the\r\nsuccess of the last move. His wife lay still panting with all the\r\ndelight of satisfied desire, and we had to help her up. She threw\r\nherself into my arms, and hugged me close to her heaving bosom, kissed\r\nme tenderly, and hoped she had relieved me of all pain. I was her own\r\ndarling boy, and she would always be truly happy in relieving me of that\r\ninconvenience whenever it troubled me. I was internally amused at their\r\ncontinuing to keep up this idea, but I humoured them, and appeared the\r\nmost innocent simpleton, notwithstanding all that had occurred. The day\r\npassed much as the previous one. After two hours\xe2\x80\x99 reading, aunt again\r\nproposed a walk, which, of course, ended at the summer house, where\r\nagain a pressure of water brought on the painful hardness, which aunt\r\nsucceeded in allaying after four most exquisite bouts of love, varied by\r\na thoroughly good double gamahuche between the last two acts. Aunt must\r\nhave spent at least ten times, and appeared thoroughly contented, but\r\ncontinued to attribute it to her gratification at having relieved me of\r\nmy painful hardness. Again I passed hours in instructive conversation\r\nwith my learned uncle and after a similar evening to the last, retired\r\nat our usual hour.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was awakened by uncle alone, who told me that my aunt was\r\nsomewhat poorly, and could not come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry it is so, for this little fellow is as hard as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am so sorry dear aunt is poorly, both on her account and my own.\r\nWhat shall I do, dear uncle? It is so hard and painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear boy, I must try to allay it myself. I love you too dearly\r\nto leave you in this state. I am not so good at allaying this painful\r\nattack as your aunt, but as you know you were successfully relieved in\r\nher bottom, and I in yours, yesterday, we shall try today if I can\r\naccommodate this huge fellow, of which I have some doubts. Take off your\r\nnightshirt as I do mine, it will be more commodious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant we were both stark naked. We threw ourselves into one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s arms and lovingly kissed each other. Our tongues met in a\r\ndelicious sucking\xe2\x80\x94our hands took each a prick, and we had a most\r\nexciting and loving embrace. The doctor then took my prick in his mouth,\r\nsucked it a little, and well lubricated it with his saliva, spitting on\r\nthe lower part of the shaft and rubbing it round with his finger. He\r\nthen knelt, and presenting a really beautifully rounded bottom of the\r\nfairest hue, he pushed it out, showing a light brown corrugated\r\nbum-hole, most tempting to look at. He desired me to wet it with my\r\nsaliva. I stooped and applied my mouth and tongue to the appetising\r\nmorsel, and thrust my tongue in as far as it would go\xe2\x80\x94to his evident\r\ndelight, leaving it well moistened. I then brought my prick to the\r\nentrance; he shoved his backside well out, and acted as if he desired to\r\nvoid himself. A firm but slow pressure quickly engulphed the knob. The\r\ndoctor desired me to rest a moment, and drop some spittle on the shaft.\r\nAgain it was firmly pushed forward, and gradually it won its way up, the\r\nbelly against the buttocks, without much flinching on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\nAfter resting a while, he desired me to bend forward and feel his cock\r\nwhile I should move backwards and forwards in the sheath until I was\r\nrelieved. I had a most delicious fuck. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole was\r\nquite hot internally. His pressures with the sphincter were exquisitely\r\ndelicious, and he had acquired the charming side wriggle so exquisite in\r\nquim fucking. Of course this was an old letch of his, which his position\r\nas schoolmaster had given him so many opportunities of indulging in, and\r\nthe still greater pleasure of initiating others in it. At this very\r\nmoment he was delighted with his delusion about me in that respect. Of\r\ncourse I never undeceived him, and he had all the extra delight of the\r\nidea. My younger and hotter passions had made me spend before he could;\r\nso after indulging me in a delicious soak after the ecstasy of the\r\ndischarge, he drew my attention to the rigidity of his own member,\r\nwhich, he said, I must now allow him to allay in turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my dear uncle, I am too sensible of your great kindness in\r\nrelieving me to hesitate about giving you the same relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI now withdrew. He rose for a mutual loving embrace, and then I stooped,\r\nand taking his fine milk-white prick with its lovely vermilion knob into\r\nmy mouth, most deliciously sucked it, making my tongue tickle the\r\nentrance to the urethra, to his infinite delight. He murmured out soft\r\nterms of endearment; then getting exceedingly lewd, he begged me to\r\nkneel down as he had done. He then kissed and gamahuched my bottom-hole,\r\nmaking my prick stand and throb again with delight. Then spitting on his\r\nprick he quickly sheathed it in my glowing backside. After pausing to\r\nenjoy the exquisite pleasure of complete insertion, he stooped, and\r\npassing a hand round my belly laid hold of my stiff-standing prick with\r\none hand, while he gently pressed the ballocks with the other. We then\r\nproceeded to active measures. He soon made me spend, which I did with\r\nloud cries of delight, giving him the most exquisite pleasure by the\r\npressures the act of spending made me exercise on his pleased prick. He\r\nsoon resumed his thrusts, and eventually we both spent together in the\r\nmost ecstatic joy. I sank forward on the bed, dragging the doctor with\r\nme still imbedded in the rapture-giving aperture of my backside. We lay\r\nlong in all the enchantment of delight. At last he withdrew completely\r\nreduced, but was surprised to see me still in a rampant state. When I\r\ngot up he took my prick in his hand, praised its noble proportions, and\r\nagain stooping, took it in his mouth, frigging the lower shaft with one\r\nhand; he then introduced two fingers into my bottom-hole, continued his\r\nsuction and movement on my prick in unison with the working of his\r\nfingers up my bum-hole, and in this manner quickly produced a delicious\r\ndischarge in his mouth. I had placed my hands mechanically on his head,\r\nand I nearly choked him as I thrust my prick halfway down his throat as\r\nI spent. He greedily swallowed every drop, and then rising, embraced me\r\nlovingly, telling me I had given him the greatest treat in the world,\r\nand he loved me dearly. After this he invited me into his dressing room,\r\nand we both entered the bath together and mutually laved each other.\r\nThen dressing we joined aunt at breakfast. She had not the least air\r\n_d\xe2\x80\x99une malade_, but with a sly smile hoped the doctor had proved as\r\nefficient as herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my dear aunt, and I am so much obliged to both of you for your\r\nsolicitude to relieve the pain I suffer in the morning, but it seems to\r\nme that it more frequently and more severely attacks me than ever. I\r\nonly hope I shall not tire out your kindness by such frequent appeals to\r\nyour aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling nephew, do not imagine anything of the sort. We are but\r\ntoo happy to be of any service to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied with a knowing smile cast at each other, caused by\r\nmy apparent uncommon simplicity, but which they were evidently glad to\r\nsee. We sat down and enjoyed a capital breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe day passed quite as the two preceding ones. Aunt asked me to walk\r\nwith her, and as before ended by leading me to the summer house, where,\r\nafter relieving my distress symptoms, as she called them, three times,\r\nand finding that the relief was still inefficacious, she proposed to try\r\nif by adopting my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s position she could not be more successful. So\r\nkneeling on the low ottoman, and throwing her clothes over her back, she\r\nexposed all the glories of that most splendid backside, and dazzled my\r\nsight with its huge magnificence and ivory-like surface, perfectly\r\nmilk-white, the pureness of which was equally perceptible through the\r\nrich light curly hair that spread bush-like between her legs, and\r\nwandering beautifully upwards between the cheeks of the enormous orbs,\r\nstole round the charming corrugated aperture that I was about to\r\npenetrate, the rosy circle of which appeared all too small to admit my\r\nvery large virile member. I threw myself on my knees, and first licking\r\nout the wide open lips of her wondrously fine cunt, and taking care to\r\npay my respects to the small knob of her indurated clitoris, I\r\ntransferred all my attention to the smaller and most charming orifice.\r\nAfter kissing it most lovingly, I thrust my tongue in as far as it would\r\ngo, and rolled it about to her infinite delight, while with my left hand\r\nbelow I kept pressing and frigging at her excited clitoris. She wriggled\r\nher glorious backside in all the agonies of the delicious excitement\r\nuntil she spent most profusely, actually hurting my tongue with the\r\ntightness of the squeeze her sphincter muscle gave as she poured down\r\nher plentiful discharge over my chin and neck. In her grand excitement,\r\nand wild with the fury of her lust, she cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! fuck me, my darling, and shove your glorious prick into my\r\nbottom-hole. Oh! fuck\xe2\x80\x94fuck\xe2\x80\x94fuck me directly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInwardly delighted at this natural outbreak of her passions, naming\r\nmatters by their more appropriate terms, I replied by acts, without any\r\nwords at the moment. It may well be imagined I was myself in the most\r\nrampant fury of desire. So bringing my raging prick up to her\r\nmagnificently large cunt, all foaming as it was with her recent\r\ndischarge, I plunged with a furious bound up to the codpiece at once.\r\nShe met my forward lunge with a backward push and a cry of delighted\r\nsatisfaction. I moved a few times in and out, so that my prick was white\r\nwith the foam of her delicious cunt. Then suddenly withdrawing, I\r\npresented it at the entrance of the more secret temple of Venus, and\r\nmore gently pushed it home, she helping me with outthrust buttocks and\r\noutward straining of the entrance, so that I most charmingly glided\r\nslowly into the glowing furnace that was awaiting with such lascivious\r\ndesire to engulph and devour my longed-for prick. For, as I have before\r\nobserved, my dear aunt was gluttonous of a bottom-fuck, after being so\r\nfucked in cunt as I had already served her. It was so deliriously tight\r\nand hot that I lay in the exquisite rapture of complete insertion for\r\nsome minutes. I had seen my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arm move in a manner to convince me\r\nshe was frigging her own clitoris, in fact, the movement of her hand\r\nfrigging herself was felt by my codpiece. I let her continue, until\r\nfinding by the involuntary wriggling of her bottom that she was about\r\nagain to spend, I aided her with my prick, and had hardly made many\r\nmoves before she poured down another tribute of lust, with a squeal of\r\ndelight, and with such pressure on my prick as nearly drove him at once\r\nto a similar discharge. I did my best, and succeeded in not following\r\nsuit. My aunt was insatiable, and I was glad to let her spend as often\r\nas possible, and I so managed matters that she spent again before\r\njoining me in the final crisis, which seized us together, and we died\r\naway in joyous cries of thoroughly, though but momentarily, satisfied\r\ndesire. I sank on that magnificent back, as the languor that follows the\r\necstatic moment overtook me, but it was only for a short time. The\r\nexquisite internal pressures that my amorous and glorious aunt was\r\nexercising on my delighted prick were too exciting not to rapidly\r\nproduce a reaction; nonetheless rapidly that it was in such a delicious\r\nretreat as the pleasure-giving aperture of that gloriously exciting\r\nbackside. I was lying down on her broad back, so passing one hand round\r\nto her large but firm bubby, I took its nipple between my fingers. The\r\nother hand sought the knob of her still stiff clitoris. I excited both\r\nwhile making a very gentle move with my hardly fully standing prick. I\r\nfelt at once how this gratified her, indeed, she often afterwards\r\nassured me that such frigging, with the movement of the softened prick\r\ngently working within her, was most exciting, and almost better than\r\nwhen it was in full force. I soon made her spend again. Another of her\r\ndelights was to have a stiff prick shove away into her the instant after\r\nshe had spent, when she herself was at the moment incapable of action on\r\nher part. She in after-days proved that her greatest pleasure was to\r\nhave a fresh-standing prick near, to take the place of one that had made\r\nher spend, and had spent itself, and have it thrust into her with all\r\nthe vigour and lust the sight of the previous fucking had inspired and\r\nfired it with. At this moment, as I had not spent, it was the exact\r\ncounterpart her libidinous imagination could have desired. I fucked and\r\nfrigged on until we both gave down in cries of joy our united tribute to\r\nVenus. We both sank this time down on the couch in utter forgetfulness\r\nof all but the ecstatic bliss with which we were overcome. We long lay\r\nsoaking in all the delightful sensations my adorable aunt\xe2\x80\x99s convulsive\r\nclutchings of my prick with her delicious close pressures excited. At\r\nlast she begged me to withdraw, although she could feel me now\r\nrestiffening under the delights of that exquisite interior. I would\r\nfain have recommenced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not, my dear boy, it is more than nature can support, and I\r\nmust consider your youth; you have delighted me even beyond previous\r\ndelights\xe2\x80\x94rise then my love, and let me embrace, thank, and love you as I\r\nshall always do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose, and we threw ourselves into each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, lovingly kissing\r\nand tongueing each other. Aunt then buttoned me up, first kissing and\r\ntaking a mouthful of my prick for a moment between her lips, and then\r\nputting him away, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cmy pretty doodle.\xe2\x80\x9d I seized the\r\nexpression, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt, you called it my prick just now, and begged me to fuck you,\r\nand to shove it well into your cunt. Are these the real names for my\r\ndoodle and your Fanny, and what does \xe2\x80\x9cfuck\xe2\x80\x9d mean, my darling aunt? Do\r\ntell me, dear auntie? and teach me the language I ought to use when you\r\nare so kindly relieving me of the pains of my now so frequent hardness.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you have observed it, dear auntie, but I never\r\nenter this summer house with you, but it becomes painfully hard at once;\r\nto be sure you give me such exquisite pleasure in relieving me that I\r\ncould wish to have constant hardnesses as long as you were near to calm\r\nthem. Is this natural, dear aunt, or a disease? Pray tell me, and teach\r\nme all the endearing terms you so lavish upon me while I am reducing my\r\nhardnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy apparent simplicity evidently pleased her. She probably thought, too,\r\nthat as I must sooner or later really thoroughly understand the nature\r\nof our intercourse, it would be much better she should, as it were, make\r\na confidant of me, and attach me more securely to herself. She begged me\r\nto be seated and she fully explained everything to me. Of course I was\r\neven better acquainted than herself with all she communicated, but I\r\nconfirmed the idea she evidently entertained of her being my first\r\ninstructress by various naive remarks on all she was telling me. Of\r\ncourse I proved an apt scholar, and by my close-put questions brought\r\nout all her own knowledge, and left nothing for me to learn. At the end,\r\nI said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo all women have such a delightful sheath\xe2\x80\x94cunt I mean\xe2\x80\x94between their\r\nlegs as you have, dear aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my darling; but you must never stray to others; you will find none\r\nso fond of you, or I may add, without vanity, so capable of satisfying\r\nthis dear fellow; but come, I see it will be dangerous to allow him to\r\nstay here longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, but I quickly unbuttoned and produced my prick in an almost\r\ngrander state than ever. I begged of her to let me have one more \xe2\x80\x9cfuck\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nnow that I knew what it all really meant. I put it into her hand. Her\r\nown previous descriptive lesson had aroused her lasciviousness. She\r\nfondly grasped it, and stooping down, kissed it, saying she could not\r\nresist its eloquent look. Throwing herself back on the couch, with her\r\nclothes up, her feet on the edge, and her legs apart, her glorious cunt\r\nlay open in its moist magnificence. I threw myself on my knees and\r\ngamahuched her until she spent: and now, knowing her greatest letch, I\r\ninstantly brought my bursting prick up to her foaming cunt, plunged in\r\nand began a furious movement, accompanying it with all the most\r\nendearing bawdy phrases she had just, as she thought, taught me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my most gloriously cunted aunt, do I fuck you? Wriggle your arse\r\nfaster\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it! Do you feel my prick up to the hilt in your delicious\r\ncunt? Oh! what pleasure you do give me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied as broadly. Passing her hand down she pressed my cods, and\r\nasked if thus squeezing my ballocks added to my pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my love, your cunt, your arse, your bubbies, are all\r\ndelicious. Oh, I never before knew there could be such additional\r\npleasure to our fucking as using these endearing words produce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were both so excited by the bawdy terms we so profusely used that we\r\nwent off in the utmost excess of ecstasy, and died away thoroughly\r\nsatiated with our libidinous and most lasciviously delicious fuck. It\r\nwas time to finish. So sliding off her, I again buried my face in her\r\ndelicious gaping and foaming cunt, my mouth, lips, nose, and cheeks were\r\ncovered with sperm; she drew me to her lips and licked it all off. Then\r\nrepairing our disordered dress we returned to the house, and found the\r\ndoctor impatiently awaiting us. Our flushed and excited faces at once\r\nshowed that we had been indulging in the greatest excess. He joked aunt\r\nupon her skill in allaying such frequent attacks as I now appeared\r\nsubject to.\r\n\r\nAunt informed him that she had inadvertently in her lust made use of\r\nexpressions which had betrayed so much to me that she had found it\r\nnecessary to leave me nothing more to learn, and I was now fully aware\r\nof the true nature of our connection; after luncheon he himself might\r\nfurther enlighten me, for she was certain that complete confidence would\r\nbe the best policy to pursue; it must come about, sooner or later, and\r\nit was far better it should come from him than that I should learn it\r\nelsewhere. He said she was quite right, and that he would further\r\ninstruct me after luncheon, so we set to work on the viands before us,\r\nto which I did ample justice.\r\n\r\nI was thus, as they supposed, newly initiated in the mysteries of the\r\ncoition of the sexes. I shall reserve further details of our more\r\nintimate and expansive experiences for the third volume of this true\r\nRomance of Lust, and still of Early Experiences.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAunt Brownlow\xe2\x80\x94Harry Dale\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Dale and Ellen\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. D.\xe2\x80\x94Ellen\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. D., Dr.\r\nBrownlow, and Harry\r\n\r\nAfter the luncheon, which closed the last volume, a churchwarden\r\noccupied uncle for about an hour. When he had left off, uncle proposed a\r\nwalk in the garden. I could see at once what this was meant to lead to,\r\nas he almost immediately turned in the direction of the summer house.\r\nWhen we got there he sat down on the couch, and begged me to sit beside\r\nhim. He opened the subject at once by saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Charlie, I am very much pleased that your aunt has opened your\r\neyes to the real nature of our actions with you, which your simple\r\ninnocence had imagined to be a mere kindly relief to the overgorged\r\nvessels of your virile member. Accident might have made you acquainted\r\nwith this through some less interested channel, and you might have\r\ninnocently betrayed your future position. I believe you to possess a\r\nlarge fund of good sense and discretion, and the advice I shall give you\r\nas to the conduct to pursue in future will not only be received with\r\nconfidence as meant for your future good, but listened to attentively\r\nand acted upon. The world, my dear boy, and by that I mean Society in\r\ngeneral, condemns the practices we have lately been indulging in with\r\nyou. Their narrow prejudices ignore the fact that nature alone prompts\r\nto these delightful acts, and that the great God of nature gifted us\r\nwith the powers necessary for their performance. But, as the world has\r\nchosen to brand them with its censure, men of prudence, like myself,\r\nwhilst apparently conforming outwardly to such stupid prejudices, know\r\nhow in secret to fully enjoy them. I am blessed in your darling aunt\r\nwith a wife who fully understands and humours my desires. She is rarely\r\nsplendid in the glorious beauties of her body, and in temperament hot as\r\nthe most erotic of our sex could desire. Even in your ignorance you must\r\nhave felt the wonderful power of conferring carnal ecstatic pleasure she\r\npossesses, and have heard how, in the energy of her passion, she allowed\r\nher lust to betray her into the use of grossly bawdy terms, but which,\r\nas they have enlightened you when best prepared to receive such\r\nknowledge, is rather fortunate than otherwise. I speak thus frankly to\r\nyou, my dear boy, because I have found you of a rare facility in giving\r\nand receiving erotic pleasures, and of a temperament worthy of the\r\ndescent from the same stock as your aunt. You are worthy of each other,\r\nand formed to enjoy to the utmost each other\xe2\x80\x99s carnal delights, and I\r\nbless my happy star that has brought you both under my own roof.\r\nHenceforth there must be no secrets between us. It was at my earnest\r\nwish that your aunt relieved you; and, of course I had my own object in\r\nview. In the first place I require some extra excitement to be able\r\nmyself to indulge in these delightful combats in love\xe2\x80\x99s domain. You and\r\nyour aunt\xe2\x80\x99s copulations were to me more exciting than you can imagine.\r\nYou will have observed, too, what is the real quarter to which, when\r\nexcited, I pay my devoirs. Glorious as is the backside of your\r\nincomparable aunt, your young charms, virgin in that respect, excited me\r\nstill more. I began by gentle touches, and then tried the insertion of\r\nmy finger, when I saw you were far too busy operating within the orbit\r\nof your lustful and lusty aunt to observe or even feel what I was doing.\r\nI found a facility about your bottom as perfect for enjoyment as your\r\ntruly magnificent prick or cock was fitted for operating in its way. It\r\nwas then I suggested to your aunt to mount upon you, and afterwards made\r\nyou aware that your aunt possessed another aperture which could equally\r\nwell allay what you then looked upon as a source of pain. My object was\r\nto lead you to the same point. Your innocent docility lent itself with\r\neasy simplicity to all my desires. I saw that you entered readily into\r\nyour aunt\xe2\x80\x99s glorious bum-hole, and allowed me to work with two fingers\r\nin your own. Finding that it rather gave you pleasure than otherwise, I\r\nproposed to abate my own stiffness in your bottom. Your affectionate\r\ndocility enabled me to obtain unfailing ecstasy. Your after-fucking of\r\nme, while I was in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, conferred the utmost erotic bliss\r\nupon me, as you have experienced when operating and being operated upon.\r\nThese\xe2\x80\x94these are the moments of a felicity your stupid prejudiced\r\nworldlings know nothing of; and these are the pleasures which, now that\r\nwe have initiated you into all their secret mysteries, we will enjoy to\r\nthe utmost. To the true votaries of these love orgies grossness of\r\nlanguage is a stimulant to passion.\r\nFuck-frig\xe2\x80\x94bugger\xe2\x80\x94cunt\xe2\x80\x94prick\xe2\x80\x94ballocks\xe2\x80\x94bubbies\xe2\x80\x94arse-hole\xe2\x80\x94are all sacred\r\nwords only to be pronounced when in the exercise of love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries. At\r\nall other times a guarded decency of word, act, and gesture is\r\nimperative, as enhancing the delight of an unbridled vocabulary in the\r\nvoluptuary of raging lust. I shall from time to time inculcate sage\r\nprecepts on this point\xe2\x80\x94enough for the present. Let us now indulge in\r\nmutual embraces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo ending, he took me in his arms and glued his lips to mine. Our\r\ntongues met. Both our hands wandered, his on my prick, which immediately\r\nresponded to the touch, my hand was placed on his prick, but which was\r\nonly at half-cock. I rapidly unbuttoned, and brought it forth, then\r\nstooping I took it in my mouth, and sucked it and fingered the root with\r\nmy hand. Then passing my other hand below, I sought to penetrate with my\r\nfinger into the interior of his fundament. He rose to a standing\r\nposition to enable me to enter his anus more easily. His prick quickly\r\nstanding fiercely showed how much I excited him. I ceased not until he\r\nwas in an agony of pleasure\xe2\x80\x94forcing my head down on his prick until it\r\nentered almost completely into my mouth, and shooting his sperm right\r\ndown my throat. I continued to suck and frig him until I produced\r\nsomewhat of a restiffening of his prick. He begged me to rise, that he\r\nmight take mine in his mouth, desiring me at the same time to take off\r\nmy trousers and lie down on the couch. I did so. He knelt at my side,\r\nand first handling and examining it with loudly expressed admiration of\r\nmy noble weapon, he took its head in his mouth, and then with his hand\r\non its lower shaft, and finger up my fundament, brought on a similar\r\ncrisis as that I had produced on himself. He just as greedily swallowed\r\nall. I had allowed my hand to fall down by the side of the couch, where\r\nit encountered his prick, which had resumed its pristine vigour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome my dear uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us put it into its favourite\r\ncorner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose, and kneeling, turned my backside full in his face. He stooped,\r\ncaressed, kissed, and tongued the rosy orifice. With the plentiful\r\nsaliva with which the operation of sucking my prick had filled his\r\nmouth, he moistened my bum-hole and his own prick, and then easily\r\nglided up to the hilt within my delighted backside. Resting for a while\r\nin all the ecstasies of insertion, which I heightened by my internal\r\npressures, he seized my prick which had stood again at once at the\r\npleasing sensation occasioned by the introduction of his prick in my\r\nbottom. Thus frigging my prick and fucking my arse, with occasional\r\npauses to lengthen out our pleasures, he at last brought matters to a\r\nmost exquisite termination, and died away in cries of joy as we poured\r\nforth a mutual torrent of sperm. Uncle continued soaking in all the\r\nblissful after-sensations, which I did everything in my power to enhance\r\nby the delight-giving pressures of my sphincter muscle. When he withdrew\r\nand rose to his legs, he helped me up, and drew me to his bosom, and we\r\nhad a long kiss of gratified desire, tongueing each other the while, and\r\nhandling our ballocks with mutual gratification. My uncle was profuse in\r\nhis praises of my docility and aptitude, declaring that his pederastic\r\nenjoyment of my person excelled all he had ever experienced in his long\r\npractice of the habit, and my delicious sideways wriggle was superior to\r\nthe very fine bum-fucking his adorable wife had the art of giving him:\r\nthen there was the further excitement of handling the very finest prick\r\nhe had ever met with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no flattery to you, my dear Charles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut mere justice\r\nto its superb dimensions and admirable power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he stopped, and sucked anew its reeking head, getting a few more\r\ndrops out. We then purified ourselves\xe2\x80\x94a basin with water was kept in a\r\nsmall cupboard purposely for such occasion, for I afterwards learned the\r\nplace had been the scene of innumerable contests of the same kind with\r\naunt and other boys. Having readjusted our disordered habiliments, we\r\nleft the grounds, and took a long quiet walk in the fields; the good\r\ndoctor inculcating admirable advice to me, whom he considered an\r\ninnocent tyro in love\xe2\x80\x99s ways. Nevertheless, all he taught me only\r\nstrengthened my high opinion of the wisdom of dear Mrs. Benson, and the\r\nadorable Frankland, whose opinion of what was likely to happen to me at\r\nthe rectory had been so quickly realised. We returned in time to dress\r\nfor dinner. The evening passed as the previous ones. I was conducted to\r\nmy room, and left alone to recruit my forces by a quiet night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. I\r\nmay here incidentally mention that it was a rule of uncle and aunt, very\r\nrarely departed from, to send their favourites to their lonely couches\r\nas a means of restoring their powers, and reinvigorating them for\r\ndaylight encounters\xe2\x80\x94both the dear creatures loving to have the fullest\r\ndaylight on all the charms of their participants in pleasure, at the\r\nsame time yielding an equally undisguised inspection of their own. This\r\nwas their principle reason, but they also considered it advisable as a\r\nrestorative, and a useful precaution not to overstrain the energies of\r\nthe youths they both so much enjoyed. My late experiences at home had\r\nalready taught me the advantage and utility of a quiet night\xe2\x80\x99s rest\r\nafter frequent contests in the fields of Venus and Juno.\r\n\r\nI slept on this occasion with a deep and continuous slumber, until I was\r\nawakened by my uncle, who came to summon me to the arms of his wife,\r\nwho, in the splendour of her full-blown charms awaited me in her own\r\nbed, naked as the day she was born. Her arms outstretched, she invited\r\nme to the full enjoyment of her glorious person. The doctor drew my\r\nnightshirt over my head, and in a moment I was locked in the close\r\nembrace of that superb creature. We were both too hot to wait for\r\nfurther preliminaries, but went at it in furious haste, and rapidly paid\r\nour first tribute to the god of love. The doctor had acted postillion to\r\nboth of us, with a finger up each anus. The exquisite pressures of my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s cunt reinvigorated me almost without a pause, and we proceeded at\r\nonce to run a second course. Uncle got three fingers into her divine\r\nbottom-hole, as her legs were thrown over my waist, and her immense\r\nbuttocks well thrown up enabled him to have full play between the cheeks\r\nof her backside. This double operation made the dear lascivious creature\r\nspend again in a very few movements, and giving her hardly time to\r\nfinish her discharge, I fucked on with double force, and with prick as\r\nhard as wood, as fast I could work. This furious onset, which was the\r\nmost exciting thing she knew of, rapidly caused a third discharge. To\r\nprevent my own prick from spending too quickly, I held somewhat back;\r\nthen again we went at it fast and furious, and the dear lustful\r\ncreature, with cries of joy, spent again with me, and fainted from\r\nexcess of pleasure; but her glorious cunt continued to throb on my\r\ndelighted prick, as if it would nip it off by the roots. I never met\r\nwith so lusciously large a cunt, or one with a greater power of\r\npressure. She could quite hold even an exhausted prick a complete\r\nprisoner in these most delicious and velvety folds. Great as was the\r\npower of Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s cunt in that way, aunt beat her. I may here\r\nmention an occurrence that took place some time after this period. It\r\nwas during a rare opportunity from an accidental absence of the doctor,\r\nwhen I was sleeping with my gloriously beautiful aunt. I had fucked her\r\nto her heart\xe2\x80\x99s content before we slept, and again on waking, in full\r\ndaylight, after which we rose to relieve our natural wants. I laid\r\nmyself down on the floor, that I might completely see my dear aunt\r\npiddle from her splendid cunt. It was a glorious sight, which instantly\r\nfired my passions and was at once followed by a fuck on the floor, my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s enormous backside being quite cushion enough, and we enjoyed the\r\nnovelty of the thing amazingly. She was loud in her praises of my\r\nindefatigable prick, which, with its vigour and superb dimensions, was\r\nbeyond all she had ever seen or felt, and just fitted her large and\r\nluscious cunt, which had never before been so well filled. This remark\r\nreminded me of a desire I had long had to have a thorough investigation\r\nof that immense and splendid object. I expressed a wish to that effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling boy, anything you like, you could not have a better\r\nopportunity, my legs point to the window, so you have the fullest\r\nsight\xe2\x80\x94look, feel, frig, fuck, or bugger, all is at your free\r\ndisposition\xe2\x80\x94only give me a pillow from the bed, as the floor is too hard\r\nfor me to continue so long as you are likely to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI jumped up and gave her two pillows. Then laying her limbs wide open,\r\nwith knees bent, the magnificence of that luscious cunt lay in all its\r\ngrandeur before me. I have before described what a large, but splendidly\r\nproportioned woman she was\xe2\x80\x94small feet, and clear-run ankles, large, but\r\nadmirably turned calves, very small knees, above which rose the very\r\nfinest and fleshiest of thighs, worthy supporters of what I have already\r\ndescribed as the largest and finest backside my eyes ever lighted on.\r\nImmense hips, and wonderfully and naturally small waist, above which\r\nwere her superb, large, fine, and firm bubbies that stood out when\r\nnaked, as hard and firm as those of the youngest of women; a charming\r\nneck, and well-posed head with most pleasing and beautiful features\r\ncrowned the whole. Her arms were superb, and equal in proportion to her\r\nother grand and splendid limbs. The flesh was of the most delicious\r\ncreamy white, without a spot or a blemish. The hair of the head,\r\nplentiful in the extreme, and so long and thick that when undone it fell\r\nall around her and below her superb buttocks, so that she could shake it\r\nout all round, and completely hide her nakedness. Often and often has\r\nshe allowed me to pose her in every way, and shake it out all over her,\r\nand well she might, for no matter how often I might have fucked her\r\npreviously, it was sure to produce at least three more encounters, one\r\nof which was always in her backside, a most favourite way with her and\r\nwhich she declared was by far the most pleasurable provided the other\r\naperture had been previously well fucked. With such a taste, of course,\r\nher greatest pleasure was to have two pricks in her at once, the _ne\r\nplus ultra_ of erotic satisfaction. To return to the inspection I was\r\nabout to describe, which was really the first at my full disposition,\r\nfor although I had often gamahuched, felt and seen the beautiful object,\r\nit was when my passions were excited, and when the gratification of lust\r\nalone prompted me, a state of mind opposed to close observation of\r\nnatural beauties. Now, repeated tributes to the god of lust had cooled\r\nmy ardour for the moment, and left me to the perfect enjoyment of the\r\nsight before me, with the temper to inspect its full-blown beauties in\r\nthe minutest way. I have said before that my aunt had one of the\r\nbroadest, most prominent, and most beautiful mounts of Venus that I ever\r\nsaw. It was thickly covered with beautiful silky fair curls, which did\r\nnot hinder you from seeing her exquisite skin below. The sweep round, to\r\npass between her thighs, was bold and graceful. In the middle was a well\r\ndefined semi-circular depression, from whence the large, thick and\r\nbeautifully pouting lips of her cunt commenced, which in her present\r\nposition lay partially open. You could just see where the clitoris lay\r\nsnug. I have already observed that this was not largely developed, nor\r\nwere the inner labia of her cunt at all projecting, indeed, they were\r\nnot visible, unless her legs, with bent knees, were stretched apart, as\r\nat present. On each side of these luscious pouting lips, and the long\r\nimmense pinky gash, was a triangle of considerable space, such, in fact,\r\nas is only to be seen in a woman of the splendidly large proportions of\r\nmy aunt; this was covered as much as her mount with fair silky curls,\r\nwhich ran down to her beautiful corrugated and rosy bottom-hole. Nothing\r\ncould be finer or more beautiful than the sight, as she thus lay fully\r\nexposing every part in the broadest daylight. After handling and\r\nadmiring all, I laid the lips well back and apart, and there they kept\r\nopen. Nothing could be more charming than the interior of that most\r\nenchanting cunt, of an exquisite salmon-pink in colour, nothing was out\r\nof order. The clitoris, which bulged out in excitement from my touches\r\nof all the parts around, lay first in the upper partition of the pouting\r\nlips; then became below, slightly open, a charming entrance to the\r\nurethra, larger than usual, to allow the mighty rush of waters to pour\r\nfrom it when piddling; below this was the opening of the vagina, which I\r\nparted with my fingers, and could see even to the corrugated sides of\r\nthat exquisite pleasure-giving sheath; then followed some sinuosity of\r\npinky flesh, whose duty it was to stretch to allow the largest prick to\r\npenetrate. Half-an-inch beyond was the rosy orifice of her bottom. Such\r\nwas the exquisite scene before my delighted eyes. I proceeded with my\r\ninternal examination. Thrusting in three fingers of each hand, I forced\r\nopen by literal pressure the lips, until I could see to a depth of four\r\nor five inches. It was a most beautiful sight. The sheath appeared to\r\nhave ribs running round it about half-an-inch apart, and I could see\r\nthey were the means of causing the exquisite pressures her cunt could so\r\necstatically exercise. Indeed, excited by my _attouchements_, I could\r\nsee them contracting and relaxing. It was, doubtless, these ribs that\r\nseemed to exercise a sort of peristaltic motion on the prick, when\r\nreposing at full stand in that glorious cunt. I was able so widely to\r\nopen this splendid vagina that I thought I would try to get my hand\r\naltogether in. Projecting my fingers forward, with the first and fourth\r\ndrawn under the middle ones and the thumb between, I pushed them\r\nforward, and as the whole cunt was reeking with my last discharge, and\r\nwas well lubricated, I glided on; there was a little difficulty at the\r\nknuckles, but I exerted a slight, gentle pressure, and in all went. Aunt\r\nwinced a little, and asked what I was doing. I told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all in, my darling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Auntie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed upon it, and squeezed it quite hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how nice!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cpush it further in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI advanced, and could feel the end of her womb, which appeared like\r\nthree points to fingers and the thumb drawn together, and looked at\r\nendways is something like what it felt\xe2\x80\x94of course, without the nails.\r\nAunt asked me if I could double my fist where it was. I had no\r\ndifficulty, as the part yielded to the greater bulk. Aunt cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling boy, that is delicious; push it further in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so, and began working within her, backwards and forwards. She\r\nwriggled her splendid backside in ecstasy, and before I had made a dozen\r\nmovements, poured down upon my hand and arm a torrent of almost boiling\r\nliquid, and went off with a cry of enjoyment. Her arms and legs relaxed,\r\nand she lay quite still in the utmost after-enjoyment, but with a\r\npressure on my arm and fist quite wonderful. Knowing how she liked the\r\nmovement to be continued at such a moment, I worked in and out slowly.\r\nShe soon recovered, and again seconded my movements, and again went off\r\nin all the fury of lust, accompanied with shouts of excitement, urging\r\nfaster movements, and again went off in all the fury of her most\r\nlibidinous nature, and spent most profusely. All this had now brought me\r\ninto as furious a state as herself. I wanted to withdraw and substitute\r\nmy prick, not only from the state of excitement I was in, but also to\r\nexperience the effects of such a well-stretched cunt upon my\r\nlesser-sized weapon. But so tight did my aunt hold my imprisoned hand\r\nthat I could not withdraw. I begged her to let it go, as I wanted to\r\nfuck her instantly, but she prayed me to give her one more of such\r\nexquisite manoeuvres, it was a joy beyond anything she had ever before\r\nexperienced, so she begged her darling boy to join. On I went as she\r\ndesired, and a more exciting picture of furious lust never met my sight.\r\nI helped her final discharge by thrusting two fingers in her bum-hole.\r\nNever shall I forget the grip she gave my arm and fingers when she\r\nspent. It was positively painful, and showed the enormous force of\r\npassionate lust. She went off in such a fury of excitement that I\r\nthought she had fainted outright. But her pressures continued all the\r\ntime. It was long before she recovered her senses, and my arm was\r\naching, and my prick bursting. At last she exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! where am I? I have been in paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdo let me out. I am bursting to fuck you, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get my arm out, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t relax your grip of my wrist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, my dear boy, it is involuntary, put your other hand on\r\nmy mount, and pull steadily, but not with a jerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so, and really it required considerable force to withdraw it,\r\nnotwithstanding I had previously unclenched my hand. I jumped\r\nimmediately upon her, and at one bound plunged into that vast cavity, up\r\nto the cods. It immediately closed upon me, and tight as she usually\r\nheld me, she really appeared to do so this time tighter than ever, so\r\nwonderfully gifted was that longest, highest, and most luscious cunt I\r\never fucked. You may easily imagine the rapid ending of such raging\r\nlust. I spent with cries more like the braying of a donkey than any\r\nother sound, and then lay like one dead on that glorious belly, with\r\nhead reposing between the firm and splendid bubbies, aunt clasping me to\r\nher bosom, panting with all it had just granted. We lay long in ecstatic\r\ntrance of the delicious after-sensations. Our mutual internal throbbings\r\ngradually re-excited all our passions. With renewed ardour I quickly\r\nmade my lascivious and libidinous aunt spend again on my delighted\r\nprick, which kept ramming at her during the swoon-like pause which\r\nspending produced; she had taught me this was exquisite delight to her.\r\nShe soon resumed the full swing of her lust, but suddenly stopping,\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, my darling, withdraw, and shove it in behind.\xe2\x80\x9d She quickly\r\nturned round, with great agility, prompted by the excess of her desires.\r\nI was behind her in an instant, and as my prick was reeking with the\r\nfuck she had just so plentifully bedewed it with, and the divine lower\r\norifice had also received its tricklings, I had no difficulty in pushing\r\nfirmly but not too forcibly right up to the meeting of her stupendous\r\nbuttocks and my belly. She sighed deeply with delight, when she felt me\r\nfully imbedded, and began the delicious side wriggle, while I remained\r\nfor some minutes quiet, that I might enjoy the superb beauty of those\r\nmighty orbs, in all their play of passion. Aunt grew furious with lust.\r\nHer hand was actively frigging both clitoris and cunt. She called out to\r\nme to shove on; two or three thrusts on my part, and the dear, lecherous\r\ncreature again poured down her nature. I paused to restrain my own\r\ndischarge, but made my prick throb within its most exquisite sheath,\r\nwhich never ceased responding most deliriously. It was but for a minute\r\nor two, when my own fierce passion drove me to very energetic action. My\r\ndelighted aunt seconded my movements, fast and furious grew our sport,\r\nuntil, with cries of the wildest lust, we both spent deliciously\r\ntogether. I sank on her glorious bottom and back, and by embracing her\r\nsuperb bubbies with both hands, until her exquisite pressures again\r\nrenewed my forces, and drove me on to another delightful career, in\r\nwhich again the hot lust of my aunt drew down from her several\r\ndischarges to my one. At last we sank both together, in all the joys of\r\nfully satiated desire. Again I lay for some time on that broad and\r\nbeauteous back, until aunt said I must withdraw, as she had great\r\nnatural want. I instantly withdrew, out he came with a loud plop,\r\nfollowed immediately by a tremendous succession of farts. Aunt professed\r\nto be quite horrified, but I only burst into a loud fit of laughter and\r\ntold the dear creature to fart, piss, or shit, whenever she felt\r\ninclined, I should only love her the better. She said she must at once\r\ndo the latter, and was running off to the water closet as soon as she\r\ncould hurry on some clothes. But I drew out the chamber, and begged her\r\nto sit down there at once. It would give me pleasure and excite me as\r\nwell. She was too hard pressed to hesitate, so sitting down, she had a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chell of a let-fly\xe2\x80\x9d as a military friend of mine used to say. I stooped\r\nover her back, caressed her bubbies and when she turned up her delighted\r\nface, our lips were glued together in a loving kiss, while my nose\r\nsniffed the really delicious odour that came from her. When she had\r\ndone, she begged me to hand her a towel to wipe herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my darling aunt, nothing of the sort; stoop down forward on to\r\nyour knees, and I will lick the delicious orifice clean with my tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed, kissed me, and told me I was a darling boy, just after her\r\nown heart, but hardly expected I had already acquired the tastes of my\r\nuncle, the rector, whose letch lay in that practice. She let herself\r\ndown on her knees as her sublime arse raised itself from the pot, and\r\nstooping her head low down, presented her immense buttocks before me,\r\nwith the chink between well-stretched open. I move the pot on one side,\r\nthrew myself on hands and knees, and eagerly kissing the exquisite\r\norifice, greedily licked it clean, and thrusting my tongue well within,\r\nrolled it about, to the great delight of dear aunt, whose passions were\r\ninstantly aroused, and her divine backside began to wriggle. I shoved my\r\nthumb up her cunt, and frigged until she spent. Meanwhile my own unruly\r\nmember had become distended to his full size, and was throbbing with\r\ndesire. So raising my body erect, I brought him again to the rosy\r\norifice I had just been tongueing, and to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s infinite delight,\r\nagain housed him as far as he could go, and again began active\r\noperations, which I continued until aunt\xe2\x80\x99s lasciviousness again made her\r\nspend. I paused a little after this, or otherwise I should have gone off\r\nmyself. Stooping over the glorious bottom, I replaced her hand with my\r\nown, and began frigging her clitoris, till her passions, again excited,\r\nmade her begin ecstatic movements, in which I joined until the grand\r\ncrisis seized us both together, ushered in with cries of joy. We spent,\r\nand sank down sideways on the floor in quite a death swoon of ecstatic\r\nand satisfied lust. Here we lay quite exhausted for some time. At last\r\naunt let me out, and begged me to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must purify you, my darling boy, as you did me.\xe2\x80\x9d And seizing my limp\r\nprick in her mouth she sucked it clean, until she began to feel symptoms\r\nof the resurrection of the flesh. She hastily rose, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Charlie, you have done far too much tonight. I must see you to your\r\nbed, that you may get at least a couple of hours sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up my nightshirt, threw it over me, led me to my bedroom,\r\ntenderly embraced me, and thanked me for such a night of pleasure as she\r\nhad never in all her life enjoyed the equal. Then locking me in, she\r\nretired to her own bed. It may well be supposed that after such\r\nexertions, I slept the sleep of the just for many hours. My aunt had\r\nfrequently come to look at me, but seeing me in so sound a slumber,\r\nwould not have me disturbed\xe2\x80\x94a politic proceeding, as it resulted in a\r\nfuller indulgence in the summer house that day than would have happened\r\nif my powers had not been restored by refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nThis kind of life had been going on for nearly three weeks. The doctor\r\nbecame less easy to move. One morning I had fucked my aunt twice; the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s prick at the end of the second had stiffened to about half\r\nstand. I took it into my mouth, which, with handling his ballocks and\r\npostillioning his bottom-hole, brought him up to the full standard. He\r\nproposed to bugger aunt while I did the same kind office to himself. A\r\ncaprice seized me, and I proposed, on the contrary, that we should both\r\nfuck aunt\xe2\x80\x99s capacious cunt at once. Aunt, for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, cried out\r\nagainst it, but the idea tickled the fancy of my uncle, who would not\r\nonly enjoy all the beauties of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s glorious backside in motion,\r\nbut could postillion her as well. So I lay down on my back, aunt mounted\r\nme, and presented her splendid bum to the attack of her excited husband.\r\nHe first thrust his prick up to the hilt in her luscious and\r\nwell-bedewed cunt; when well lubricated, he withdrew, to allow me to\r\nmake my place in full possession, then bringing his stiff-standing prick\r\nagainst the root of mine, pressing it well down, he gently shoved\r\nforward, and gradually sheathed himself within the well-stretched and\r\ncapacious orbit of my aunt, who winced a little in pretended pain, but\r\nwho, by the grip she immediately gave to the double fuck within her,\r\nshowed how much gratified she was. After a pause of enjoyment, I gave\r\nthe signal for exact joint movements, both pulling out gently, and\r\nsliding slowly in again. Two or three thrusts, aided by the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger in her bottom-hole, sufficed to make dear lecherous aunt spend\r\nprofusely. We increased our speed, but still not fast, which quickly\r\nreawakened all aunt\xe2\x80\x99s lust. Before we ourselves were ready, the dear\r\nlascivious creature again poured down her nature, boiling hot, on our\r\ndelighted pricks. This produced such excitement upon us that we could no\r\nlonger restrain our own desire to come to the ecstatic conclusion. Our\r\nmovements became more rapid. We each felt the electric-like sensation of\r\nthe approaching crisis. Aunt doubly felt the influence of our increasing\r\nspeed and hardness, and was as ready as ourselves to pour down the\r\ntribute to the goddess of love or lust, holy Mother Venus. The novelty,\r\nthe pressure, and the excess of pleasure declared itself in the loud\r\ncries of the last crisis, as we all died away in the enrapturing\r\nsensations produced by the intense satisfaction our desires had\r\nexperienced. We lay long wrapped in the after-ecstasy; aunt\xe2\x80\x99s delicious\r\ninternal movements began again. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prick had shrunk to a merry\r\npiece of inanimate dough, and he withdrew, begging us at the same time\r\nto change our position, and let him enjoy seeing me attack my aunt in\r\nrear. This inflamed me at once. Aunt rolled from off me. I took my place\r\nbehind, and we ran a most delicious course, rendered much more excitable\r\nto me by the introduction of uncle\xe2\x80\x99s two fingers up my fundament, which\r\nkept time with my action in the delicious aperture of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\nsuperb and glorious backside, the movements of which beneath my\r\ndelighted gaze had not been the least stimulating part of the enjoyment.\r\nThe crisis was most ecstatic, and I sank exhausted on her broad buttocks\r\nand beautiful back, to clasp her lovingly in my arms and sob out bawdy\r\nterms of the warmest endearment. The doctor, who had very much enjoyed\r\nthe sight, but who pointed out the sadly downcast state of his prick,\r\nwhich had been in no wise excited by the scene, said to his wife\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, we must have recourse to the grand remedy, I will also\r\ninitiate dear Charlie into a new mystery of love, of which he can have\r\nno idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI guessed at once what he meant, but professing extreme ignorance, I\r\nbegged him to tell me what it was. Aunt rose and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, your uncle requires his blood to be excited by flogging his\r\nbuttocks with a birch rod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI never felt anything but the severest pain when I\r\nwas flogged, and I took precious good care not to deserve it again. How\r\nthen can it excite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her wardrobe and produced a formidable rod of fine fresh-cut\r\nbirch twigs. The doctor begged me to lie down on my back\xe2\x80\x94he got over me,\r\nand we commenced sucking each other\xe2\x80\x99s pricks. Mine stood at once, as the\r\ndoctor, in addition to sucking, thrust a couple of fingers up my\r\nbottom-hole, and frigged away as fast as he sucked. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuttocks were left at the mercy of aunt, who flogged away at them with\r\nno gentle hand. I spent before the doctor could quite get his prick to\r\nstanding point, but the copious torrent I poured into his mouth, and his\r\nafter-suction on my prick, in addition to the red raw state of his\r\nbuttocks, at last brought him up to full stand. He wanted to put it into\r\nme when ready, but aunt said that as flogger she had herself become\r\ngreatly excited, and must have it herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile this dear prick,\xe2\x80\x9d throwing herself on it, and sucking it, \xe2\x80\x9cshall\r\nfuck me at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was quite ready, and she straddled across me, and guided my now\r\nlonging prick into her luscious cunt. She soon stopped, and we tongued\r\neach other while the doctor was mounting to the assault on her delicious\r\nbottom-hole. As soon as he was housed, we began another charming course,\r\nin which aunt, as usual, spent frequently before our less lecherous\r\nnatures were ready to join in one general and exquisite discharge. We\r\nwent off in furies of delighted lust, and then sank exhausted in the\r\ndelicious after-sensation. We long lay in the sweet inanition and luxury\r\nof satiated lust. At last we disconnected ourselves, rose, and laved\r\neach other with cold water, more as a restorative than as a\r\npurification. Aunt and I had two bouts after\xe2\x80\x94one in front and one\r\nbehind. The doctor would not allow a fresh application of the birch, as\r\nhe said it would only produce so great an exhaustion as would require\r\ndays to restore. I retired after this, but ever afterwards the doctor\r\nwas regularly birched before he could even copulate once. Sometimes he\r\nrequired to flog my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s glorious bum to excite his fading powers,\r\ndeclaring that it was almost as exciting as being flogged. He even gave\r\nit me gently, although I hardly ever required it, but I professed my\r\nsurprise at its efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe holidays were at an end, but I was as yet the only boarder. There\r\nwere, however, some twenty or thirty youths from the neighbourhood, who\r\nwere day scholars at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s school. Among these the doctor had his\r\npick in the flogging way, but he never allowed them to know anything of\r\nour other proceedings, or to imagine that the birching which took place\r\nwas otherwise than as a punishment for faults or inattention. However, I\r\nwas generally the chosen companion of these whippings, in which I acted\r\nas horse, or holder of the boy to be flogged. Of course I took good care\r\nto expose as much as possible their lovely cocks, as well as their plump\r\nbottoms, and as this excited me as well as the doctor, it often ended,\r\nafter the culprit was dismissed, in my flogging the doctor, followed by\r\na mutual rack off in each other\xe2\x80\x99s bottoms.\r\n\r\nThere was one fine, plump, girlish-looking youth, named Dale, who was\r\nhere for the first half. He had not as yet been brought up for\r\npunishment, although the doctor had confided to me the letch he had\r\ntaken to flog his fine fat bottom. One day, Master Dale brought a sealed\r\nnote from his widowed mother, who lived about a mile from the village,\r\nin a charming cottage ornee. The doctor read the note. By chance I was\r\nlooking at him, and saw a smile of joy light up his features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Master Dale,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a mild and gentle voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nmother tells me that you have behaved in a most shameful manner to your\r\npretty young cousin, who is residing with your mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster Dale blushed scarlet, for he was not aware until now that anyone\r\nhad been a witness to the scene that had taken place between him and his\r\npretty cousin.\r\n\r\nThis was what had passed. The cousin, a lovely girl of fifteen, was in a\r\nsecluded spot in the garden, near an arbour, the preceding afternoon.\r\nShe was bending down, tying up a flower close to the ground, which made\r\nher stoop to such a degree that she could only reach it with ease by\r\nhaving her legs wide apart. Her back was towards the walk by which young\r\nDale was advancing. As he approached unheard by her, he could not fail\r\nto see peeping out between the stretched open expanse of snowy drawers\r\nthe inner part of her well-rounded globes of dimpled ivory. Her shift\r\nhad somehow worked upwards, and revealed all the charms of her delicate\r\nyoung bum and plump white thighs. The sight inflamed the youth beyond\r\nmeasure. He crept up noiselessly quite close to her, and, stooping down\r\nuntil his head was below the level of her raised petticoat, he feasted\r\nhis eyes for some time with the lovely prospect before him, her little\r\nvirgin rosebud slit, its pink and pouting lips, plump little mount\r\nalready delicately shaded with a curly foliage that promised soon to be\r\nmuch more dense, together with the swell of her lovely young thighs and\r\ncalves. All this was quite unsuspected by the object of his admiration,\r\nwho was absorbed in her garden operations. At length, however, the\r\nexcited youth could not resist the temptation of applying his soft warm\r\nhand to the parts he was admiring, which made Miss scream slightly\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nthinking it was some insect up her petticoats\xe2\x80\x94exclaiming\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! oh, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut turning her head round, she discovered the delinquent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Ellen dear, but really you exposed so very pretty a sight\r\nwhile stooping that upon my word I could not help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow girls are curious as well as boys, perhaps more so; and if the truth\r\nmust be told, Miss had for some time past longed for an opportunity to\r\nbecome better acquainted with things in general, and, therefore, thought\r\nhere was a chance not to be thrown away. So, after some little show of\r\nresistance on her part, for decency\xe2\x80\x99s sake, it was agreed between them\r\nthat he should have a good look at _hers_, if he would afterwards show\r\nher _his_. Miss Ellen had never seen a male \xe2\x80\x9cdiddle,\xe2\x80\x9d as she and her\r\nyoung playfellows called it, not even that of a boy, and she was all\r\nexcitement and expectation to feel with her own hand the \xe2\x80\x9cfunny thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor so a communicative servant-maid had described it, who at the same\r\ntime had fully explained the theory of its use, which made Miss long to\r\nobtain some practical knowledge also. So to the arbour they both\r\nadjourned. Miss Ellen first lay back upon the seat, while the young\r\nrogue unfastened her drawers, and pulling them down, feasted his eyes\r\nwith a full view of her virgin charms as long as he pleased, for Miss\r\nEllen was a lecherous little maid, who really felt a precocious pleasure\r\nin being thus exposed to the close observation and admiration of one of\r\nthe opposite sex, although for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake she covered her blushing face\r\nwith her delicate little hands. He touched _it_, pressed _it_, rubbed\r\n_it_ with his finger. Her thighs trembled and opened. Taught by nature,\r\nhe imprinted a burning kiss on the lovely little quim before him. She\r\nsighed, and mechanically put her hand on his head and pressed it closer\r\nto her naked skin. Guided by his feelings, he indulged in movements of\r\nhis lips and pressures which speedily excited the amorous little maid to\r\nsuch an extent as to make her give down with a deep and trembling sigh\r\nthe first tribute of her virgin cunt. Feeling the warm liquid oozing\r\nfrom the pouting orifice on his closely pressed lips, he could not help\r\ntasting it with his tongue. This reawakened very quickly the\r\nsensibilities of the lecherous little thing, and awoke her to the desire\r\nto practise a like pleasure with his cock. So reminding him of his\r\npromise, she made him stand up before her, while she undid his trousers\r\nwith her fairy fingers, all trembling with excitement, and drew out his\r\nstiff affair, which already gave promise of a very respectable future,\r\nnow swollen to a size it had never before known. Delighted at the sight\r\nof so bewitching a plaything, she made him lie down as she had done, and\r\nkneeling beside him, with cheeks glowing with excitement, she closely\r\nexamined every part of the rampant little member. Strange to say, no\r\nhand, hardly even its owner\xe2\x80\x99s, had as yet invaded its virgin precincts,\r\nand it had not yet had its ruby head fully uncovered, although he was\r\nupwards of fifteen. The delight caused by the touch of her warm hand\r\npressing and encircling his stiffened cock was most exquisite. She was\r\nnot long, however, before she became curious to see what could possibly\r\nbe underneath the skin that covered its rounded head. In her toying she\r\nsought to draw the skin back over the head, a slight cry of pain from\r\nhim caused her to stop. But when, be she young or be she old, is a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity to be baulked. She had managed to draw it back a short\r\nway, and now it suddenly occurred to her that by the help of a little\r\nmoisture her object might be accomplished without hurting the dear\r\nfellow. By an impulse of passion she stooped and took the rosy head into\r\nher delicious little mouth, closing her coral lips around it, and\r\nlubricating it with her tongue, to the intense gratification of the\r\nyouth, who involuntarily wriggled his body about voluptuously, and could\r\nnot help raising it up to her mouth. This movement, combined with the\r\npressure of the lips, perfectly succeeded, without further pain, in\r\ncompletely unhooding the charming little cock she was so deliciously\r\nembracing in the soft folds of her lips. She lifted up her head to see\r\nthe result. The tight foreskin had closed below the nut, and left the\r\nnow fiery red head bursting with excitement, and visibly throbbing with\r\nintensity of passion. Her joy and delight at this full revelation of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfunny thing,\xe2\x80\x9d as she continued to call it, now knew no bounds. She\r\ndrove him nearly frantic with her ardent caresses\xe2\x80\x94she again drew the\r\ncovering over the vermilion head, and still finding that it did not\r\neasily return again, she thrust her head down upon it, and with lips,\r\nmouth, and tongue began again her attempt to unhood it. Poor Dale was\r\nbrought up to the wildest state of excitement, his hands involuntarily\r\npressed down her head, his body rose to meet it, and at that ravishing\r\ninstant the grand crisis seized him, and, with a cry of delight, he shot\r\nforth his first tribute to Venus within the delicious mouth in which he\r\nwas enclosed. The ecstatic gush poured down the throat of the dear girl,\r\nand she gulped it all down by the mere effort to avoid choking. Poor\r\nDale\xe2\x80\x99s hands fell down insensibly from her head, which she instantly\r\nwithdrew, and gazed on the youth. To her great surprise she beheld the\r\nso lately rampant weapon drooping its head and withdrawing within its\r\nshell, while some few drops of a milky white creamy like liquid were\r\nslowly oozing from the small orifice of its head. While she gazed it\r\nreduced itself to a mere shadow of its former state, and the foreskin\r\nslowly covered again the so lately fiery and bursting head. She was lost\r\nin wonder, and was about to express her surprise at the strangeness of\r\nthe whole affair, but they now became aware that footsteps were\r\napproaching. Fortunately for them, as they thought, the noise of the\r\ngravel underfoot was distinguishable at such a distance that they had\r\ntime to arrange their clothes, and when Dale\xe2\x80\x99s mother appeared at the\r\narbour, she found them, on entering, quietly seated and talking\r\ntogether; and thanks to the youth\xe2\x80\x99s discharge in his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s sweet\r\nmouth, without any tell-tale flushings of his face. Little did they\r\nsuspect she had already seen all.\r\n\r\nThis then was Master Dale\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, and this it was that had been\r\nfully and minutely detailed in the note sent by this mother to the\r\ndoctor, with a request that he should punish him well in whatever way he\r\nshould think proper. The note further begged to know the terms for his\r\nbecoming a boarder with the doctor, as she could no longer have him\r\nresiding in her house with her orphan niece, whose guardian she was. You\r\nmay easily imagine the double delight of the doctor. Another boarder, a\r\npoint of some consequence to him after a previous scandal which,\r\nalthough hushed up, had deprived him of house pupils; and now with two,\r\nhe foresaw a quick return to his full number; and then his delight at\r\nhaving to flog young Dale, and the erotic pleasure of drawing from him\r\nthe exciting description of their young loves and voluptuous actions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Master Dale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I have an account to\r\nsettle, follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without a word further he led him into his private room, where, as\r\nwas generally understood in the school, he birched the worst offenders.\r\nArrived in the room alone with the young culprit, he locked the door,\r\nand taking a large cutting birch rod from a closet, sat down on a sofa.\r\nHe called the youth to him and told him to unbutton and let down his\r\ntrousers, and tuck up his shirt well under his waistcoat. This being\r\ndone, the doctor said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Master Dale, we shall see if this birch will cool your itching for\r\nfeeling your pretty cousin\xe2\x80\x99s private parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Dale had never yet been punished more severely than by the hand of\r\nhis mamma, and certainly trembled at the sight of the formidable birch\r\nrod threatening his now bare bottom; yet, notwithstanding his fears, the\r\nallusion to the pretty private parts of his cousin so fired his\r\nimagination that his cock instantly stiffened and stood out, to the\r\ninfinite delight of the doctor, who augured therefrom a future further\r\nfelicity. Keeping him standing close beside him, and enjoying the sight\r\nof his youthful charms so deliciously exposed immediately before his\r\neyes, he proceeded\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Master Dale, you have, it seems, been gratifying yourself with\r\nlooking and feeling between the legs and thighs of a pretty young girl\r\nof fifteen, your cousin, is she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed out the youth.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s gaze was fixed upon the stiff and rampant member of the\r\nyouth, watching the throbbings produced by every allusion to the\r\nluscious scene of the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, come, tell me all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his arm round the\r\nsobbing boy\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and making him stand still closer beside him. \xe2\x80\x9cWas\r\nshe such a very pretty girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother throb of the rampant member.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you saw all her legs, thighs, plump little bottom, rosy pouting\r\nlittle _slit_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(_throb_\xe2\x80\x94_throb_\xe2\x80\x94_throb_)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmoist with the dew of\r\nexcitement and amorous play eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little machine seemed ready to burst at the thought of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did it have the same effect as I see it now has on _this?_ Dear me,\r\nhow naughty it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here the lecherous doctor took the rampant little cock in his hand\r\nand pressed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did she do to this, did she touch it so?\xe2\x80\x9d squeezing it gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered out the youth, who was getting greatly excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, passing his hand gently and caressingly up\r\nand down the stiffened and throbbing little cock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, too, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d pushing back the foreskin off the head,\r\nand as quickly replacing it, several times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x94es. Oh! sir; oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, as the doctor swiftly frigged his cock, began to be\r\nexquisite. The doctor could not resist the temptation of bringing things\r\nto a crisis. Clasping the youth tightly with one arm, he continued his\r\ntoying with the plaything in a quick exciting manner, apparently without\r\nreflecting upon what he was about, uttering, at intervals\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chow naughty it was of you; but how pretty she must have\r\nbeen to tempt you to do so, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lovely youth was now in paradise. In the exquisite sensations of\r\npleasure he felt he was losing all consciousness when the doctor\r\nsuddenly stopped short and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is indeed, a pretty piece of business, seducing your young cousin;\r\nyou must be cured of such doings in future by means of a good flogging\r\nwith an excellent birch rod, and on this your saucy bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he let fall the arm that had clasped the boy\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and let his\r\nhand wander over the plump, hard, and lovely orbs. The doctor now took\r\nup the rod which he had previously dropped to occupy his hand with the\r\ncharming young prick he had just been so deliciously frigging. Shaking\r\nthe rod angrily at the now trembling youth, he exclaimed, in a fierce\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you young rascal, down, down on your knees, and beg to be\r\nflogged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor boy was forced, trembling, to obey. This over, the doctor\r\ncommanded the delinquent to lie down across the sofa. Reluctantly he\r\ncomplied, but at last he straddled across it with his snow-white plump\r\nbackside fully bared to view, and a fair mark to the threatening rod. He\r\nlooked like a young Adonis displaying his beauties to a satyr. The\r\ndoctor was greatly excited at the lovely prospect, and gloated his eyes\r\non the beautiful display, and, then and there, there sprang up a\r\ndetermination to fully enjoy the ravishing of these virgin charms before\r\nmany weeks were over. Lifting the rod on high, he cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you young villain, I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to look up young ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\npetticoats again, I warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClasping him tight round the waist, the rod descended smartly on the\r\nlovely hillocks of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s charming backside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor at each blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! sir, oh! Do pray forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the beautiful youth, as he\r\nfelt the stinging strokes descend on his hitherto virgin posteriors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh sir. Oh! sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never do so any more. Oh! sir. I won\xe2\x80\x99t indeed.\r\nOh! pray, sir, have mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, whose erotic passions were fully aroused, was deaf to all\r\nhis entreaties, and kept on flogging harder and harder, and faster and\r\nfaster while the poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s bottom bounded and tossed upon the sofa; but\r\nhe was kept in a firm position by the strong arm of the doctor, who, to\r\nhold him the faster, had laid hold of the stiff cock still at full\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall not escape my cuts, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d cutting\r\nat the lovely delicate buttocks with all his might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! sir; mercy, mercy; I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must bear it, you young rascal you shall have no mercy until I have\r\nmade your bottom bleed for your crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor youth, from the pain he was suffering, bounded up and down on\r\nthe sofa as he felt the stinging blows descend upon his bottom. This\r\naction caused his standing cock to rub up and down in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s warm\r\nhand, who seemed to have accidently laid hold of it. The effect was such\r\nthat the poor youth hardly knew whether he felt most pleasure or pain,\r\nfor while his posteriors were of a burning heat, the warmth flew to the\r\nopposite part, which was so deliciously clasped in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncaressing hand. He ground his teeth with pleasure and pain, he ceased to\r\ncry out, but sobbed and moaned with the excess of indefinable feelings.\r\nThe doctor never ceased lecturing him, dwelling continually on the\r\nbeauties of his lovely young cousin and the scene in the arbour. He\r\nthought but of her, of her lovely pink little slit so sweetly shaded\r\nwith soft downy short curls; how she had so charmingly caressed his\r\ncock, until he felt a heave and a shudder, another, a sensation as if he\r\nwas going to expire, a short cry, a catching of his breath. Wildly and\r\nvigorously he thrust his member down on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s warm hand, he shut\r\nhis eyes, he felt not the rod, although the doctor redoubled the strokes\r\nwith all the force of his arm, and drew blood at every cut. A bound, a\r\nconvulsive start, and he felt as if his lifeblood were coming from\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94out it spurted in large drops on the sofa and on the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\nThe youth had with difficulty shed another tribute to Venus. For a\r\nmoment or two he felt as if in paradise, but a sharp cut from the rod\r\nquickly aroused him. He was soon fully alive again to its tortures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you young rascal, what is this you have been doing on my best\r\nsofa, eh, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\nAnother sharp stroke demanded a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, sir. Oh! sir; indeed I\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo lies or evasions here, sir, for they will not avail you. Your bottom\r\nshall pay for this nastiness. Why, what is it? What can it be? I never\r\nsaw the like of this in my life, I declare,\xe2\x80\x9d and he examined it with his\r\neyeglass, saying more to the same effect.\r\n\r\nPoor Master Dale was, we know, quite in the dark as to what it could be,\r\nor how it came there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas this ever occurred to you before,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, yesterday, when my cousin was caressing it in her mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the frightened youth, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happened,\r\nand did not mean any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cyour mother did not mention that, did\r\nshe see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, it happened just as she was coming through the shrubbery, and\r\nwas all over before she reached the arbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so your cousin took it into her mouth, why did she do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was curious to see what was under the skin of its head, and finding\r\nit would not go back without hurting me, she put it into her mouth to\r\nwet it and make it go back easier, which it did for the first time; she\r\npulled it forward again, and again put it into her mouth to push the\r\nskin back with her lips, when I felt funny all over, and something came\r\nout of me into her mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Well, you must tell me all about that another time. This\r\nflogging will be enough for the present, but I shall punish you for your\r\nnastiness some other time. Put up your trousers, in a day or two I shall\r\nwant you in this room to pay for your dirty conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor boy retired, sobbing hysterically.\r\n\r\nThe second day after this the doctor sent for Master Dale, who, in the\r\nmeantime, had occupied the bedroom next to mine. The doctor was in his\r\nprivate room in his dressing-gown, long and flowing, so that for the\r\nmoment it concealed the fact that he had nothing but his shirt on below\r\nit. He received Master Dale somewhat sternly, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, for your punishment for your last nasty misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the frightened and trembling youth, \xe2\x80\x9cI really could not\r\nhelp it,\xe2\x80\x9d and he began to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! pray, sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t flog me so hard\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more trouble that you give me, the harder will be the flogging. Now\r\ntake off your jacket and waistcoat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow come close to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor then lowered down Dale\xe2\x80\x99s trousers, and raising his shirt,\r\ncontemplated with great pleasure the pretty belly of the lovely boy, and\r\nthen turning him round, under pretence of seeing if the weals of the\r\nlast flogging were still visible, he gazed on his white firm backside\r\nand swelling thighs, examining the marks still left from the previous\r\npunishment. He then turned him round, and inspected the pretty little\r\ncock, which, under the mortal fear he was in, hung down its head in a\r\nlimp and pitiable state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so this is the little offender,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, applying his hand to it,\r\nand squeezing and pressing it gently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a naughty little thing it\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth could not avoid showing the pleasure these lascivious caresses\r\ngave him, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t smile, sir, this is no laughing matter. Look at the marks of\r\nthe mess you made on my sofa,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to it. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have my\r\nfurniture spoiled in this manner, so if your little cock is to be\r\nnaughty again, I must flog you upon my knees, but first come here; take\r\noff these trousers, which hanging about the legs are only in the\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94there. Now sit down on my knee, and tell me all about this naughty\r\nlittle thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew aside his robe, so that the boy\xe2\x80\x99s bare bottom came in naked\r\ncontact with his brawny naked thighs, and the youth could feel the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s prick swelling up, although that part was still covered with\r\nhis shirt. The doctor, taking hold of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s now standing prick,\r\nasked if it had ever behaved so badly before the scene with his pretty\r\nyoung cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sir, never. I never thought of it until I got sight of her bare\r\nbottom and other parts by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor continued his toyings, caressing the young balls, and feeling\r\nall over the plump and firm backside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he is going to be naughty again!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, as the youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprick throbbed under his exciting touches. \xe2\x80\x9cI must flog your bottom for\r\nall this, for it is very naughty and improper. Why, you seem to take a\r\npleasure in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, I never felt anything so delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Dale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more reason I should punish you, but remember, you bad boy, if you\r\nare to do that dirty thing again, you must do it on my knee, and not on\r\nthe sofa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor then took the birch in hand, and with his arm round the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaist, drew him to him, but before laying him across his knee, he\r\nslipped the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shirt over his head, leaving him stark naked in all\r\nthe glorious fairness of skin and beauty of form. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\ngloated over the charming sight, but becoming too excited to pause\r\nlonger, he drew up his own shirt, displaying his fine pego at full\r\nstretch. He bent the boy\xe2\x80\x99s warm body over his brawny thighs, and with\r\nhis arm pressed his glowing form against his own rampant pego\xe2\x80\x94Dale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyoung stiffened cock rubbing against the naked thigh he lay on. The\r\ndoctor now raised the rod, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir, for your punishment, I must flog this round, hard, little\r\nbottom, till it reddens again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhack, whack, went the birch rod, but with much less force than on the\r\nprevious occasion, but still sufficiently stinging to cause the youth to\r\nmove up and down, rubbing his cock against the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s thighs, and\r\ncausing him such ecstasies as hardly to allow him to feel the blows. His\r\nwarm soft flesh, too, rubbing against the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s large, stiff tool,\r\nsoon put them both in a delirium of delight. The doctor then changed his\r\nposition, and drew the boy more over his belly, so that his great prick\r\ncould get between the boy\xe2\x80\x99s thighs, rubbing under his balls in the\r\ntrough between the buttocks, while the boy\xe2\x80\x99s cock rubbed against the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s belly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cI have got you fast, and must teach you not to\r\nplay such naughty tricks in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhack\xe2\x80\x94whack, again went the rod, causing the most delicious movements of\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s backside upon the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s excited prick, and not less upon\r\nhis own, which was rubbing against the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s belly, giving fresh\r\npleasure at each repetition of the blow. But neither of them had spent\r\nyet. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s bottom was now red with a glowing heat, and his cock was\r\nin a state of intense excitement, and the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s tool was as stiff and\r\nrandy as possible. The doctor now ceased his flogging, and squeezing the\r\nboy tight against his person, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have not done that naughty thing today\xe2\x80\x94the flogging has done\r\nyou good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lovely boy looked up and smiled. He had felt the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s large\r\nprick working away between his thighs, and pressing against the cleft of\r\nhis buttocks. As the doctor relaxed his hold, the boy turned half round,\r\nthus releasing it from its confinement. Looking down, he beheld the\r\nlarge stiff monster imbedded in a forest of dark curly hair, presenting\r\na startling contrast to his own small member, which was as yet hardly\r\nfledged with a silky down around it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, who observed the flush of excitement the sight of\r\nhis superior prick gave the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a shame it is of you to compel me\r\nto flog you in this manner, without my trousers. I must give you a\r\nlecture\xe2\x80\x94so sit on my knee, thus,\xe2\x80\x9d placing him so that his lovely bottom\r\nshould press against the huge prick. Taking the boy\xe2\x80\x99s cock in his hand,\r\nhe said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stiff it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must not play such naughty tricks. I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow it. You are\r\ntoo young yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor worked the skin of the sweet boy\xe2\x80\x99s cock up and down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that the way your pretty cousin played with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, and then she took it in her mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you like to have it done to you, you bad boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, sir, it is such pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it really give you so much pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed, it was most delicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, I must try if it would do so to me, take hold of my cock and\r\nrub it up and down, as she did, that I may know how it feels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear boy had already longed to do so, but had been afraid to say\r\nso. He now seized with avidity the noble prick, so stiffly standing\r\nbeside him. He could hardly grasp it in his hand, and worked the skin up\r\nand down in the most delicious manner. The doctor was in ecstasies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you naughty boy, to teach your master such bad things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not very nice, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the charming youth, as the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuttocks responded to every stroke of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is, indeed, very nice, I could not have believed it; but if\r\never I catch you at it again, you may be sure I shall flog you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor responded to every rub upon his prick with another rub\r\nupon the boy\xe2\x80\x99s cock, until almost at the same moment a most delicious\r\nmutual spend was the result of their lascivious toyings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cput on your clothes, and remember you must\r\navoid such naughty tricks in future, or your bottom will pay for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor made me aware of this, and arranged for a meeting of us\r\nthree, under the pretence of inattention which I was to simulate and\r\ndraw young Dale into some fault that would require punishment. It was\r\nalso arranged that I was to initiate him still more into the secret\r\npleasures of mutual satisfaction, so as to prepare him for still greater\r\ngratification to the lecherous doctor, who liked nothing better than\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cteaching the young idea how to shoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after passing a delicious night with my lovely and glorious\r\naunt and the doctor, in which we practised every delightful method of\r\nenjoyment, and in which the doctor stimulated himself by recalling and\r\ndescribing the exciting interview with the innocent youth, I left them,\r\nand entered young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s room. He had insensibly kicked off all the\r\nclothes, and lay on his back exposed, with his promising young cock at\r\nfull stand, throbbing from time to time; and by the involuntary\r\nmovements of his body, and the smile on his face, he was evidently\r\nrealising, in his sleep, the scene he had enacted with his pretty young\r\ncousin. He was quite charming to look at, his young and throbbing prick\r\nwas deliciously fair, and you could see the blue veins coursing through\r\nit, the top was only partially uncovered, the point of the head showing\r\nits vermilion tip in fine contrast to the creamy white and crossed blue\r\nveins of the stiffened shaft. His balls were as yet not fully developed,\r\nbut such as they were, they formed a closely drawn up little bag,\r\ncrimped and wrinkled, and felt as hard as stones. I gently handled them,\r\nwhich made him heave his bottom in evident ecstasy. It was all so\r\nbeautiful and enticing, and I could not resist stooping down, and taking\r\nthe delicious morsel in my mouth. Pressing the glorious head with my\r\nlips, I thrust, to his infinite delight, the foreskin back, his buttocks\r\ninstinctively rose to meet my voluptuous and lascivious proceeding. He\r\nawoke on the instant, but in that dreamy state that made him think he\r\nwas only realising the previous dream. His hands embraced my head, and\r\npressed it down closer on the delicious prick which already touched the\r\nback of my mouth. He cried out in an ecstasy of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling Ellen, what a joy you are giving me. Oh! oh! it is\r\ngreater than I can bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt by the electric stiffening of his young cock that the crisis was\r\nclose at hand. I tickled his tightened balls with my hand, and pressed a\r\nfinger hard against his bottom-hole, but without entering more than the\r\ndepth of the nail, at the very instant that he poured his young tribute\r\ninto my longing mouth. I immediately swallowed the greater portion,\r\nlubricating the still throbbing shaft with a part. For some minutes he\r\nlay on his back, with closed eyes, in all the after-enjoyment,\r\nheightened by the continued suction of his still throbbing prick, which\r\nI kept up for a short time. At last he opened his eyes. It was broad\r\ndaylight, and when I lifted my head, his eyes seemed almost to start out\r\nof their sockets in a sort of incredulous surprise, at finding it was\r\nnot his dear young Ellen, but me, his school companion. For a minute or\r\ntwo he was speechless with consternation, until taking hold of his fast\r\nreceding little cock, I asked if I had not given him quite as much\r\npleasure as his darling Ellen had previously done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you? and Ellen! how do you know anything about my cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin, is she? I did not know that, but when I came in, you were\r\ndreaming of her, and muttering in your sleep the delight she gave you by\r\nsucking your prick; so I thought I would give you the true pleasure of\r\nthe thing, and thus realise your dream; besides, I, myself, not only\r\nlove to suck a prick, but also to have my own sucked, and I could\r\nneither resist the opportunity, nor fail to be delighted that you should\r\nalready have practical knowledge of its enjoyment\xe2\x80\x94did I not give you the\r\ngreatest pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; it was most delicious, and then I thought it was my pretty\r\ncousin, even after I awoke, which made it doubly delightful, for I had\r\nno idea it would be so nice with another boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? see this charming little fellow is already raising himself up\r\nagain at the mere thought; look how its head is showing its ruby face,\r\nand how it throbs. Ah! I must suck it again\xe2\x80\x94it is so delicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI threw myself upon it, and devoured it at once, rapidly moving my head\r\nup and down, and titillating the orifice of the urethra with my tongue.\r\nI quickly drove him half mad with excitement. My mouth was full of\r\nsaliva. I slobbered some out on my fingers, and lubricated all about the\r\naperture of his charming backside, and then, as he became still more\r\nfurious in the upward lunges of his bottom, and downward pressures of\r\nhis hands on my head, I thrust my middle finger up his fundament, and\r\nworked away, frigging it in unison with the movements of my mouth. I\r\ndrove him half frantic with pleasure, the ecstasy again seized him, and\r\nwith a cry of agonised delight, and a convulsive shudder, he poured a\r\nstill more copious draught of love\xe2\x80\x99s essence into my mouth, which, as\r\nbefore, I greedily swallowed. He lay panting in ecstatic joy for a much\r\nlonger period than before, with convulsive upward thrusts of his still\r\nhalf-stiffened prick within my mouth, which still continued its\r\npressures and suctions to his infinite delight. At last I rose. He held\r\nout his arms. I precipitated myself into them; our lips met in sweet\r\nembrace. I thrust my tongue into his mouth, and solicited him to do the\r\nsame, and we had some delicious tongueing, nature having at once\r\nachieved his love education. We were closely entwined in a loving\r\nembrace. I had become terribly excited notwithstanding the hard work I\r\nhad undergone during the night, and my prick stood stiff as iron\r\npressing against his belly. Suddenly the thought occurred to him that he\r\nought to gratify me in like manner as I had done him. He proposed it,\r\nand begged me to turn from off him, and lie on my back. I immediately\r\ncomplied, and pulling up my shirt, displayed my immense splitter in all\r\nits glory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat an enormous cock! Why, it is bigger than\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you have seen the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d He blushed, and acknowledged\r\nit. I drew from him an account of their proceedings, which I already\r\nknew, but I was at the same time delighted to have surprised the\r\nacknowledgment from himself, in his wonder at seeing my large\r\nproportions. I made him show me all he had done to the doctor, and the\r\ndoctor to him; as all this was paving the way for future proceedings\r\nwith the doctor\xe2\x80\x94in fact, the innocent youth was already playing into our\r\nhands. His admiration of and handling my prick was meanwhile exciting me\r\nup to the greatest pitch. As I had continued questioning him regarding\r\nhis proceedings with the doctor, he could only play with my prick in his\r\nhands. Now that matters were getting too warm for further discussion, he\r\nstooped down, but could only get the head and a small portion of the\r\nupper part of the shaft into his mouth. His lips closed beneath the\r\ngland in the most exquisite manner. I begged him to grasp the lower part\r\nof the shaft with one hand, and to thrust a finger of the other up my\r\nbottom-hole, which I had already lubricated by spitting on my fingers\r\nand conveying the saliva in the desired direction. He obeyed with the\r\ndocility of an apt apprentice\xe2\x80\x94and thus working in unison, quickly\r\nbrought on the ecstatic crisis. I seized his head in my hands, and, at\r\nthe final discharge thrust it down on my delighted prick, as I poured\r\nout a perfect torrent of sperm, nearly choking the poor youth with the\r\nlength of prick I thrust into his mouth. He was obliged to withdraw for\r\nan instant to take breath, but I was pleased to see that he instantly\r\nresumed his delicious sucking of my prick, which he continued to do\r\nuntil it gradually shrunk up to very diminished proportions. I then drew\r\nhim upon me, and we had another sweet embrace of lips and tongues, and\r\nthen, side by side, we held a long converse on erotic matters. He told\r\nme all the tale of his affair with his cousin, and, although I was\r\nalready well acquainted with it, I was glad to draw all the particulars\r\nfrom himself. I had seen the note his mother wrote to the doctor. The\r\nminuteness and undisguised description she had therein given struck me\r\nas very strange, and I augured that she herself must be a lewd and\r\nlecherous person, to have done more than merely hint at the affair,\r\ninstead of dwelling, doubtless in erotic delight, on such details. So I\r\npumped him as to what sort of woman his mamma was. His description\r\nshowed that she was a fine, full grown woman, old, in his opinion, but\r\nin reality in the prime of life, between thirty-five and forty. He had\r\nnot scanned her proportions with any erotic thought and did not seem to\r\nattach the idea of the woman to her\xe2\x80\x94only that of the mother. But I drew\r\nout of him that she was broad in the shoulders, full in the bosom, with\r\na small waist, small feet, and small hands, a very fine head of hair,\r\nand fine eyes\xe2\x80\x94evidently a desirable woman. Already I had set my\r\nimagination in play, and began to hope I might some day work my way into\r\nher favour. It will be found how well I succeeded, as these true\r\nmemories will describe when I arrive at the period of my success with\r\nher. For the present I had advanced the erotic education of the dear\r\nyouth considerably, and thus prepared him for further initiation at the\r\nhands of the doctor and his glorious and magnificent _cara sposa_, who\r\nhad already determined to enjoy his first fruits in cunny land. We had a\r\nsimilar enjoyment, carried somewhat further the next morning, in which\r\nwe practised more fully the frigging of the bottom, and discussed the\r\npleasure it produced. I was gradually leading him on. That morning I\r\npurposely arranged that we should be late in entering the schoolroom.\r\nThe doctor sternly reprimanded us, and told us we must attend him in his\r\nprivate room after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Poor Dale turned pale as he heard\r\nthis, dreading the punishment to come of which his experience was so\r\nrecent and so severe.\r\n\r\nAt twelve we, apparently ruefully, entered the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s _sanctum\r\nsanctorum_. He had preceded us by some few minutes, and had already\r\ndonned his long dressing-gown, by which I was certain that he had at the\r\nsame time doffed his pantaloons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, boys, you must prepare for your punishment, I cannot allow\r\nthis evidently wilful inattention. Off with your clothes except your\r\nshirts and stockings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe hesitatingly stripped; poor Harry Dale weeping at the thought of the\r\ndreaded punishment. I deemed it prudent also to draw a long face. The\r\ndoctor spread a towel over his sofa, saying we had such naughty cocks\r\nthat we were constantly dirtying his sofa. He then desired us to kneel\r\non it with our heads down, and our tails well up. He then rolled up our\r\nshirts, and tucked them in above the small of our backs, in doing which\r\nhe indulged in various lascivious touchings, which excited us as well as\r\nhimself, and all our three cocks were at full stand. Harry Dale turned\r\nhis head to gaze at mine, and could not resist putting his hand upon it,\r\nand gently pressing its large stiff shaft. Young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s smaller, but\r\nvery beautiful member, which was daily developing itself in a striking\r\nmanner, also excited me, and I reciprocated his caresses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will never do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cI must flog this evil spirit out\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw off his dressing-gown to be more at his ease, he said, and\r\ntaking rod in hand, applied it gently in turns to each of our projecting\r\nbottoms. It was not for punishment but for excitement that he operated\r\nupon us. He quickly threw our bottoms all in a glow, and our excitement\r\nbecame intense, and we wriggled our bums in evident delight. This was\r\nthe point the doctor wished to attain, that he might arrive at his\r\ndesired object, which was the possession of young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop, my dear boys, I see you are at your naughty tricks again,\r\nbut there must be no spending yet; get up. We must all strip to the\r\nbuff, and I shall show you how they used to flog me when I was at\r\nschool. Stand up, Charles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so, and the doctor for an instant handled, in evident delight, my\r\nhuge stiff-standing pego, drawing young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s attention to its much\r\nlarger dimensions than his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, lean half forward on the sofa. Dale, put your arms round his\r\nwaist, and stow away this charming rampant little fellow between the\r\ncheeks of Charles\xe2\x80\x99 buttocks. Charles, do you spit on your hand, and\r\nmoisten between the cheeks, and then press with your hand his throbbing\r\nyoung prick against the cleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as directed. Young Dale felt so deliciously sheathed that he\r\nthrust his cock well forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are properly horsed, as we used to say, and\r\nnow, for a little more flogging of these fine hard, rosy mounts,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nlasciviously caressed them before applying the rod.\r\n\r\nWhack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94fell the strokes, sufficiently sharply to make Master\r\nDale wince and wriggle his bottom to and fro. Quickly the exciting\r\npleasure overcame all pain, and his lust rising, he thrust furiously in\r\nthe artificial channel he was operating in. I now shortened the grasp of\r\nmy hand on his shaft, and pressing it somewhat upwards, raising my\r\nbuttocks at the same time, I directed it so fairly upon the aperture\r\nthat at the next push it entered fully two inches within; then again\r\nfavouring his return stroke, he completely sheathed himself up to the\r\nmeeting of his belly against my buttocks. I gave him a pressure which\r\nhad an instant effect, and he began to thrust fast and furiously,\r\nevidently enjoying it to the utmost. I let him feel the full enjoyment\r\nof his new quarters, only telling him to lay hold of my cock and frig\r\nme; and then I cried out to the doctor\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlog him well, sir, he has thrust his cock into my bottom-hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing the doctor most wished for. So he continued his\r\nflogging only to such an extent as to still more inflame the lust of the\r\nnow lecherously excited boy, who shortly brought on the final crisis and\r\ndied away in delight as he shot his first tribute within the divine\r\ntemple of Priapus. At the moment of the crisis coming on, the doctor had\r\nceased his flogging and wetting two fingers gradually introduced them\r\ninto the bottom-hole of young Dale, and frigged him in unison with his\r\nmovements into me, so that the ecstasy was almost more than the poor boy\r\ncould bear. He lay almost inanimate on my back, but his still throbbing\r\nhalf-standing cock responded to the inward pressures I was exercising\r\nupon it. The doctor had ceased his flogging to admit and caress the\r\nwell-formed posterior of the charming boy. Becoming greatly excited, he\r\ndrew him off me, and closely embraced him, but professing at the same\r\ntime to be greatly shocked; his prick, meanwhile, gloriously stiff,\r\npressed hard against young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s belly. The doctor then relaxing his\r\nhold, young Dale gazed, with pleased enjoyment, on the size and\r\nstiffness of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s cock, and, by an impulse of passion, took it\r\nin hand, knelt before him, and put it into his mouth, and sucked it\r\nlasciviously. The doctor placed his hands on Dale\xe2\x80\x99s head, and pressed it\r\ndown for a minute or two, and then begged the dear youth to rise, as he\r\ndid not yet wish to spend\xe2\x80\x94thanking him for the exquisite pleasure he had\r\ngiven him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit is your turn to flog, so Charlie, you must be horsed\r\nupon me, and Harry Dale shall take a first lesson in the art of flogging\r\nupon your posteriors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pose was arranged as before. My formidable weapon was placed between\r\nthe cheeks of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s fine fat backside. His hand pressed my cock\r\nas I had done to Dale\xe2\x80\x99s. Dale took the rod in hand, and at the very\r\nfirst cut made me wince, for the young rogue laid on with a will. The\r\ndoctor had applied a good quantity of saliva to the end of my prick, and\r\nthrusting out his buttocks, he quickly guided it into the longing\r\norifice, in which I vigorously sheathed myself to the utmost extent. I\r\nseized his cock and squeezed it gently, but he begged me not to make him\r\nspend, but to enjoy myself to the utmost, crying out, at the same time\r\nto young Dale\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlog him well, Harry, for he has thrust his great tool up my\r\nbottom-hole; it is wonderful how it ever could get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed so little could young Dale believe in the possibility of such a\r\nthing that he stopped flogging to assure himself of the fact, by both\r\ntouch and sight. I drew my prick out and in that he might be perfectly\r\nsatisfied of the truth, and the doctor wriggled his backside to and fro\r\nto show what pleasure it gave him. Of course, all this was preliminary\r\nto the grand attack he meant afterwards to make on the virgin aperture\r\nin young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s bottom. After Harry had assured himself of the fact, he\r\npitched into my poor bottom with redoubled vigour, which, though it\r\ngreatly excited me at the moment, made my poor bum smart for days\r\nafterwards. I quickly sent a torrent of sperm far into the entrails of\r\nthe doctor, to his great delight, but he tenaciously avoided spending\r\nlest his powers should fail to overcome the natural obstacle of a virgin\r\nbottom-hole, especially in one so young as Dale. Consequently, after\r\nretaining me for some few moments in the delightful pressures of the\r\ninternal folds, he allowed me to withdraw, all reeking with my own\r\nsperm. It was now the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be flogged by me, while he was\r\nhorsed on Harry\xe2\x80\x99s loins. As Harry had already found out what pleasure a\r\nbottom-hole gave to the plugger of it, and had also seen how the doctor\r\nseemed to enjoy, and so easily engulphed, the much larger weapon I\r\npossessed, he had no idea there could be any pain accompanying it, and\r\nconsequently he lent himself entirely to every direction that was given\r\nhim. He placed himself in the easiest position, stuck his bottom well\r\nout, stretching wide the channel between the orbs, and exposing a\r\ncharming little rosy aperture most tempting to the sight; indeed, the\r\ndoctor instantly knelt to pay his devotions to it, devouring it with\r\nkisses, and thrusting his lecherous tongue within its tight little\r\nfolds, taking the opportunity to thoroughly lubricate it with his\r\nspittle. This preliminary, followed by a little frigging with his middle\r\nfinger, which produced nothing but pleasurable sensations in the dear\r\nyouth, completely captivated him. The doctor wisely informed him that\r\nthe first attack was sure to be somewhat painful, but that if he felt it\r\nso, he was not to draw away his body, but simply to complain, and the\r\ndoctor would instantly remain quiet without withdrawing, and he would\r\nthen find that the strange sensation would rapidly pass off, and allow a\r\nfurther progress, which would be again arrested if the pain was renewed.\r\nIn this way he would eventually find that the pleasure would become\r\nindescribably delicious, as he had seen how both Charlie and himself had\r\nenjoyed it. Poor Dale assured the doctor he might proceed at once, and\r\nhe would be perfectly docile. So the doctor first asking me to suck his\r\ncock a little to moisten it well, put the charming youth in the best\r\nposition, telling him to strain as if he wished to void himself, then\r\napplying his well-lubricated pego to the rosy orifice, by gentle\r\npressure, he succeeded, with hardly a twinge of pain to the dear boy, in\r\nhousing the head and about two inches of the shaft within the delicious\r\nreceptacle. Here the pain became so great that young Dale would have\r\nwithdrawn himself away from the doctor had the latter not taken the\r\nprecaution to seize him by the two hips, and hold him as if in a vice,\r\nbut without attempting a further insertion then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep still, my dear boy, and I will not move, and you will find in a\r\nminute or two that the strange sensation will pass away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning his head to me, he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, gently frig the dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI immediately did so, which rapidly had the effect of exciting him up to\r\na pitch that made him forget all pain, and he even thrust his bottom\r\nfurther back, and as I had taken the opportunity of the pause to drop\r\nsome more spittle on the lower shaft, a further gentle pressure forced\r\nit in almost up to the hilt. Here, again, young Dale cried out to stop,\r\nit was so painful.\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused again. I continued caressing his now inflamed and\r\nstiffened prick. His convulsive twitches, caused by my lascivious\r\ncaresses, were followed by involuntary wrigglings, which of themselves\r\ncompleted the entire insertion of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s excited prick. He still\r\ncontinued quiet, allowing the passions of the youth to become still more\r\nexcited. Then gradually and gently withdrawing, and as gently again\r\nthrusting within, he went on until the youth\xe2\x80\x99s movements betrayed the\r\nraging lust that possessed him\xe2\x80\x94then the doctor increased his pace. I\r\nfrigged on fast and furious, and in a few minutes they both died away in\r\nwild excess of the most ecstatic joy. As to Dale, his gaspings and wild\r\ncries of delight proved that the final joys were almost too great for\r\nhim to bear. The doctor had drooped his head upon his chest, and closed\r\nhis eyes, in all the gratification of having ravished the first fruits\r\nof this charming youth\xe2\x80\x99s beauteous bottom, and I could see by his\r\nmomentary convulsive thrusts, and the pressures of his hands on Dale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhips to draw the bottom more completely against his belly, as well as by\r\nthe broken sighs that heaved his bosom, how exquisitely he was enjoying\r\nhis triumph. Gradually his cock reduced its dimensions, but even when\r\nquite down and soft, it left the tight sheath it was in with a \xe2\x80\x9cplop\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshowing how well and close those delicious folds had embraced it. The\r\ndoctor would not allow young Dale to rise until he had embraced and\r\nkissed the lovely bottom that had just yielded him such intense\r\nsatisfaction. Then, drawing the youth to his bosom, he embraced him most\r\ntenderly, and thanked him for the heroic manner in which he had borne\r\nthe attack, and told him he would never suffer so much in after-attacks\r\nas he had done in this first taking of the virginity of his bottom-hole.\r\n\r\nIt was thus this dear youth was initiated into our mysteries, and\r\nhenceforward he became an apt disciple, and by being introduced into our\r\ninterior circle, added much to the variety and enjoyment of our orgies.\r\nFor, as may well be supposed, my glorious and most lecherous aunt\r\nthoroughly enjoyed the taking of his first tribute in the legitimate\r\ntemple of holy Mother Venus. I was present on the occasion, which was\r\nsupposed to be unknown to the doctor. The first coup was on her belly,\r\nthe sight of which and her truly magnificent cunt wildly excited Dale,\r\nand his cock stood stiffer and really bigger than ever. It was quite\r\nsurprising how rapidly it developed when once he got thoroughly into\r\nhardness. He fucked aunt twice, spending as rapidly as she herself,\r\nlecherous as she was at all times. I acted postillion to them both. I\r\nstopped further combats until I too could enter the field. So aunt\r\nmounted upon him, and falling forward lent her divine backside to all my\r\nfantasies. Twice we ran a course without changing. Then aunt herself\r\nclaimed my big prick for the contentment of her randy cunt. We quickly\r\nchanged positions. I, on my back, received dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s delicious cunt on\r\nmy stiff-and-hard-as-wood-standing pego. She straddled over me, and sank\r\nher luscious orbit down upon me until our two hairs were crushed between\r\nus. Here, by rising and falling, she had another delicious discharge\r\nbefore bending down to be embraced by my loving arms. She then presented\r\nher most glorious bottom to the wonder and admiration of dear Harry, who\r\nhad been caressing and kissing it, and at the critical moment had thrust\r\na frigging finger in, and turning his head in front had greatly\r\nincreased the pleasure of my loved and lecherous aunt by sucking the\r\nlarge nipple of her wondrously fine bubby. When once she was fairly down\r\non my belly, Harry scrambled up behind, and quickly inserted his already\r\nfine but still comparatively small prick, which, of course, found ready\r\nentrance where my splitter had previously opened and greased the way;\r\nbut he gave a cry, almost of pain, or at least of surprise, on finding\r\nthe sudden grip which my aunt, with her wonderful power of pressure,\r\ninstantly gave him. At it we went, fast and furious, until again the\r\ngrand crisis overtook my lascivious aunt, who spent deliriously. We boys\r\nboth paused a second or two to allow her to enjoy her discharge to the\r\nutmost; then recommencing with increased vigour and speed, we soon both\r\ndischarged at one and the same time our freights into the delighted\r\nvessels that were conferring such exquisite enjoyment upon us. Aunt,\r\ntoo, did not fail to join us at the ecstatic moment. We lay for many\r\nminutes panting in all the after-sensations of the most exquisite joys\r\nhumanity can revel in. We kept it up for several hours, aunt sucking\r\nyoung Dale\xe2\x80\x99s toothsome prick while I gamahuched and postillioned her to\r\nher infinite satisfaction. In this way, and with repeated changes from\r\none receptacle to the other but always both occupied at once, we at last\r\ngained a reprieve, and retired to well-deserved repose. The doctor, who\r\nhad kept out of the way on this our first bout with my glorious aunt,\r\nafterwards apparently surprised us together, and, after giving us and\r\nreceiving a pretty sharp flogging, he joined in all the ecstasies of our\r\norgies. He especially delighted in being into my bottom while I fucked\r\nhis wife, and he himself had the double pleasure of having young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfast growing pego into his bottom at the same time. It was some time\r\nlonger before I succeeded in completely sheathing my huge prick in the\r\ndelicious bottom-hole of the dear youth, but at last I succeeded to the\r\nutmost extent of my wishes, and although I continued to hurt him for\r\nsome weeks after the first attack, he could at last entertain me with\r\nperfect ease, and we were thus enabled to play successively into each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s bottoms, and everyone of us enjoyed the exquisite delight of\r\nfucking and being fucked at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs we grew more lasciviously intimate, I often turned the conversation\r\non his mother and cousin. At last I told him, I thought from his\r\ndescription that his mother would be a good fuck, and that if ever I had\r\nthe opportunity I might cover his attack on his cousin by fucking his\r\nmother; only we must lead her to believe that she took my virginity. The\r\nidea pleased him. He began to think his mother must be a desirable woman\r\nfor me, as I was so largely hung; and then the opportunity that I would\r\ngive him to enjoy his longing for his cousin was an inducement to second\r\nmy views to the utmost. Towards the close of the half-year his birthday\r\noccurred, and his mother could not do less than have him home for the\r\nday. She felt that her niece would be in greater security when Harry\r\nbegged she would allow him to bring with him the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s nephew\xe2\x80\x94myself,\r\nto wit\xe2\x80\x94telling her that we had become very close friends as well as\r\nschoolfellows. I had previously told him I should play the complete\r\ninnocent, but should take care some time or the other during the day to\r\nput myself in such a position that his mother should get a glimpse of my\r\nprick, so that if not immediately successful, I might pave the way for\r\nfuture success. His birthday fell on a Saturday. We were only asked to\r\nspend the day, with the intention of returning in the evening.\r\nAccordingly, on the happy day we made our appearance after breakfast. I\r\nhave before said that his mother lived in a very pretty cottage ornee,\r\nabout a mile and a half from the parsonage. We were most kindly received\r\nby her. She first lovingly embraced her son, wishing him many happy\r\nreturns of the day, declaring that he was much improved, &amp;c. She then\r\nturned to me, and gracefully and kindly bade me welcome. The niece was a\r\ncharming girl, just budding into womanhood. She blushed greatly in\r\nwelcoming her cousin, and bashfully did the same to me. We spent the\r\nearlier hours in conversation; the mother having much to ask and to hear\r\nfrom her son, from whom she had never before been separated. I had thus\r\ntime to scan her well. She was a fine, broad built, well standing up\r\nwoman, with broad shoulders, and hips that gave promise of good form\r\nbeneath. Without being beautiful, her face was a well-formed oval, with\r\nreally fine eyes, to which her son\xe2\x80\x99s description had hardly done\r\njustice. It appeared to me that a good deal of suppressed passion lurked\r\nin their expression, and I already began to think she would be a real\r\n_bonne bouche_ if once we could come to close quarters. After luncheon\r\nwe strolled in the garden. The leaves had already fallen, but the\r\nafternoon was bright and warm for the end of November. I told young Dale\r\nto keep close to his mother, and not show any wish to stray away with\r\nhis cousin\xe2\x80\x94feeling certain that if she became anxious about their\r\nmovements I should have no chance to play off my little game. All went\r\nas I could wish, we threw his mother off her guard, and she then began\r\nto show closer attention to me. I acted the ingenuous and innocent youth\r\nto perfection, but at the same time, in thinking of her charms, I let my\r\nprick get up to half-stand, so as to show its large proportions under my\r\ntrousers. I very soon perceived that it had struck her notice, and her\r\nattention became concentrated upon me. She questioned me a good deal,\r\nand especially sought to find out if _peculiar_ intimacy existed between\r\nher son and me. I played the innocent, and professed that the utmost\r\nintimacy existed; but when she tried to find out if it had gone to what\r\nshe really meant, I gave such an innocent character to our intimacy that\r\nshe was quite convinced of my thorough ignorance of all erotic\r\ntendencies, and she became more endearing in her manner of addressing\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHarry and I had previously agreed that after I addressed to him some\r\nparticular frivolous remark, he should seize the first occasion near a\r\nshrubbery to go on more ahead, and alarm his mamma by turning round a\r\ncorner. Our stratagem succeeded. She immediately hastened to follow\r\nthem. As soon as she had turned the corner I drew out my tool, now at\r\nfull stand, and placed myself so that when she returned she should see\r\nit fully developed, while I would take care not apparently to see her,\r\nbut be intent upon piddling. To the utmost of my wish it fell out. She\r\nhad told her son to stop and returned to join me. My eyes being turned\r\ndownwards did not let her become aware that I was watching for her, but\r\nI could see the bottom of her petticoats as she turned the corner, and\r\nalso that she came to a sudden stop, which must have been at the moment\r\nshe caught sight of the noble proportions before her. I took care to\r\npass my hand once or twice backwards or forwards while pissing, and then\r\nshook my prick deliberately, and exposed the whole length and breadth of\r\nit for a minute or two before buttoning it up, during which I could see\r\nshe stood perfectly still, rooted to where she had first stopped. After\r\nI had buttoned up, I stooped down, apparently to tie my shoe, but in\r\nfact to give time for it to be supposed I had not seen her previous\r\napproach. So when I rose up she was already at my side. There was a\r\nflush on her cheek and a fire in her eye that showed the bait was\r\nswallowed. My role was to play the perfect innocent, and appear quite\r\nunconscious of her having seen me.\r\n\r\nShe took my arm, and I could feel that her hand trembled. She led me\r\nalong, hastily at first, until we joined her son and niece. After that\r\nshe became uncommonly endearing in her manner to me, making such remarks\r\nas she thought would show her that I was not so innocent as I looked, if\r\nmy replies had jumped with her expectations. But I was in reality too\r\nexperienced not to pay her off in kind, and ended in making her believe\r\nthat she had a perfect virgin to deal with. We walked on, she was\r\nevidently much preoccupied, becoming at times quite silent for a minute\r\nor two, and then, gently pressing my arm, she would make some\r\nendearingly flattering remark, at which I would look lovingly but\r\ninnocently up to her face to thank her for her kind opinion. On these\r\noccasions her eyes sparkled in a peculiar manner, and her colour went\r\nand came. After a while, her hand left my arm and rested on the opposite\r\nshoulder, in a half embrace, which became warmer and warmer, her\r\nconversation became more affectionate. She was profuse in her\r\ncongratulations that her son had found so charming a schoolfellow; and\r\nhere she halted, and turning half in front of me, said that she felt\r\nthat she could love me as if I were indeed her own dear son; and,\r\nstooping slightly, she sought a kiss of maternal affection. I threw my\r\narms round her neck, and our lips met in a long and loving kiss\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nwarm on her side, but a simple though affectionate kiss on mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9chow happy I shall be to call you my mamma, and I will\r\nlove you as if you were it, it is so good of you to allow me to do so.\r\nThis half-year has been the first time in my life that I ever was\r\nseparated from my mother\xe2\x80\x94and, although my dear aunt is as kind as\r\npossible to me, still I can\xe2\x80\x99t call her mamma. My guardian won\xe2\x80\x99t allow me\r\nto go home for the Christmas holidays, but now I shall have a dear, kind\r\nnew mamma to make me happy.\xe2\x80\x9d Here I again raised my lips for an embrace,\r\nwhich was given with even more than the previous warmth. Her arm had\r\nfallen to my waist, and she pressed me with energy to her bosom, which I\r\ncould feel was unexpectedly firm, and even hard. I had great difficulty\r\nin keeping my unruly member down, that she might think I took her warm\r\nembraces as nothing more than affectionate friendship. I succeeded,\r\nhowever, and this, of course, more than ever convinced her of my entire\r\nignorance of carnal desires. As I closely embraced her, and glued my\r\nlips to hers, she became greatly agitated, trembled visibly, sighed\r\nconvulsively, and then pushed me from her, and seemed suddenly to\r\nrecover herself, seized my arm, and hurried on after her son. For, as\r\nmay well be supposed she had purposely loitered behind to allow them to\r\nget out of sight, before she indulged her uncontrollable desire to\r\nembrace me. She spoke not a word until we came in sight of them,\r\napparently sauntering along, innocently enough. But Harry afterwards\r\ntold me that having seen how his mother had halted to gaze at my prick,\r\nwhich he knew beforehand I meant she should see, he had watched us\r\nthrough the shrubbery, and afterwards had noticed her warmth of manner\r\nto me, and the loitering of her walk. He had turned a corner some\r\ndistance ahead of us, and was out of sight when his mother stopped to\r\nembrace me, as described above. He guessed she would be in no hurry to\r\nfollow him. So rapidly advancing with his cousin, he got some way before\r\nus, and choosing a place where he could see us through the bushes when\r\nwe did follow, he sat down on a garden seat, and drew his cousin on his\r\nlap, asking her if she did not regret their hasty separation after their\r\nlast delicious interview, and telling her his mother had seen them,\r\nwhich was the cause of his being sent as a boarder to the doctor. She\r\nwas much surprised to hear this, as her aunt had never breathed a word\r\nof it to her; and she had been greatly distressed at his being sent away\r\nfrom home. Of course his hands were not idle; but first unbuttoning his\r\ntrousers, he put his cock, now much increased in size, into her hand.\r\nShe at once observed how much larger it had become, and began to caress\r\nit. He meanwhile was busy frigging her little clitoris. He found that\r\nshe was already quite moist, and he had hardly frigged her a minute,\r\nwhen a sigh and an \xe2\x80\x9cOh! how much more pleasure you give me than my aunt\r\ndoes.\xe2\x80\x9d She spent profusely, grasping his prick with painful tenacity.\r\nHer breath was taken away for some minutes. When she recovered a little,\r\nand was gazing lovingly with half-closed eyes upon him, he at once\r\nrecurred to her unexpected confession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does my mother do this to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since you were sent away; your mother took me to sleep with her,\r\nas she said, she felt so lonely after you left. For some time she used\r\nto embrace me very lovingly, and hold me close pressed to her bosom. As\r\nI always went to bed before her, I was generally sound asleep when she\r\njoined me. I used at first to wonder how when I awoke in the early\r\nmorning my chemise was drawn up close to my neck, and your mother\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\nin the same state, and our two naked bodies closely united by the\r\nembracing arms of your mother. I even one morning found that my hand was\r\nheld by hers against that part which you are now feeling so nicely. She\r\nhad fallen asleep in this position, but I could feel that she was as\r\nmoist there as you have just made me. I could not help feeling it was\r\nvery nice, and gently removing her hand, I began to feel all over her in\r\nthat part and, do you know Harry, she is all covered with such thick and\r\ncurly hair there. In groping about, I felt the lips pouting and thick,\r\nand on trying I found I could get my fingers in. I pushed on, I got up\r\nto the knuckles, when I felt it give such a convulsive pressure upon\r\nthem, and her body was projected towards me with a heave of her bottom,\r\nthen drawn back, and pushed forward again, while her arms pressed me\r\ncloser to her, and she commenced some loving expressions in her sleep. I\r\nfelt something grow hard against my thumb, it was just what you have\r\nbeen feeling.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh! go on,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI renewed my tickling operations again, and I made her spend,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cAs she came to her senses, I gamahuched her; I thrust my\r\ntongue up her sweet little cunt, and licked up all the delicious\r\nspendings. As I rose, with prick erect and standing stiff out of my\r\ntrousers, she seized it in her mouth, and, with very little sucking,\r\nmade me spend to excess, and the dear girl swallowed it with all the\r\nluxury of the utmost voluptuousness. We had no time for more at that\r\nmoment, as I caught sight of mamma\xe2\x80\x99s dress through the trees. I buttoned\r\nup hastily, and we strolled along, as if nothing had happened. It was in\r\nour after-walk, when we had allayed mamma\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion, that my dear\r\nEllen continued her confessions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stiff thing pressing against her thumb was mamma\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris, which,\r\nby her account, is wonderfully developed. She, knowing from her former\r\nexperience with me that it was the point of most exquisite enjoyment,\r\nturned her finger upon it, and began awkwardly playing with it. It was\r\nat this moment that the greater excitement awoke mamma, who finding to\r\nher surprise what Ellen was doing, seized her hand, and pressing and\r\nrubbing it with more art against her clitoris, continued its action with\r\nexclamations of delight, declaring that Ellen was her dear precious\r\nloved girl, and then with a positive cry of delight, spent profusely\r\nover Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s hand. After panting for some time in perfect bliss, she\r\nturned and took Ellen in her arms, kissing her most warmly, and\r\nthrusting her tongue into Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and then demanding hers in\r\nreturn. After much embracing, mamma asked her how she came to do what\r\nshe found her doing when she awoke. Ellen described how she found her\r\nhand held against it, and then two naked bodies pressed against each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94that she was surprised at this, and wondered how it came so; that\r\non moving her hand she felt mamma give a throb down there, and a push of\r\nher body forward, which made her finger slip easily in, this still more\r\nsurprised her, as she had tried often if her fingers could get into her\r\nown, but it hurt her so much that she had given it up as impossible; and\r\nnow she had found one where all her fingers, up to the knuckles, slipped\r\nin quite easily; the inside movements, and the heavings of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody, showed that it gave her pleasure. In continuing her movements she\r\nhad felt a hard body at the upper part pressing against the side of her\r\nhand; she withdrew her fingers to feel this strange thing, and in doing\r\nso aunt awoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know the rest, dear auntie, I was so glad that I had given you\r\nso much pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d her aunt replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall love you more dearly than\r\never; yes, and you, too, shall have the utmost pleasure. I have long\r\nwished to initiate you into the secrets of womanhood, but thought you\r\ntoo young to be able to keep secret such intimacy as we may indulge in.\r\nOften in your sleep with your lovely naked charms exposed to me, and\r\npressed against my own lascivious person, have I enjoyed you, and even\r\nmade use of your own hand all unconscious in sleep, to excite me to a\r\nstill greater pitch; last night I had enjoyed you to the utmost, kissing\r\nyour lovely budding and hidden charms, and must have unconsciously\r\ndropped off to sleep with my hand still pressing yours against my secret\r\ncharm. But now I must initiate you into the same joys, even in a more\r\nexquisite way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon this she begged me to throw off my chemise, while she did the\r\nsame. We stood up to do this, and your mother took the opportunity to\r\npose me in every way, admiring and kissing me all over. I did the same\r\nto her, and I can assure you, dear Harry, your mother is far better made\r\nthat I am, both in the bosom and the bottom, and with such firm thighs\r\nand legs, and her affair is so well-developed and pouting, and with such\r\nsilky curls all around it. I can feel you passing your fingers through\r\nthe curls of mine; but though it has more than it had when last you felt\r\nand caressed it, it is nothing to dear auntie\xe2\x80\x99s. When she had much\r\nexcited me, and was evidently herself greatly so, she desired me to lie\r\nacross the bed on my back, and to draw my knees up so as to let my feet\r\nrest on the edge. She then placed a footstool in front, and kneeling\r\nupon it, after first feeling and caressing me down there, she glued her\r\nlips to it, and after sucking a while began to play with her tongue upon\r\nwhat you have been so deliciously rubbing. She licked me most\r\nexquisitely, and soon made me die away in ecstasy of delight. She sucked\r\nit for some time after, while I lay in a languid state of joy. When at\r\nlast she rose, she threw herself on the bed, and our two naked bodies\r\nbecame closely united in the most loving embrace. Her lips were wet with\r\nthe moisture that had escaped from me, its peculiar aromatic odour\r\n_m\xe2\x80\x99enivrait_ and I could not help licking the creamy juice from off her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my beloved aunt,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried, \xe2\x80\x98you have given me the joy of paradise,\r\nI must try and do as much for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My darling Ellen, you will make me positively adore you. I now only\r\nregret that I had not sooner taken you into my confidence, as I at once\r\nperceive I might have done so in perfect safety. Yes, my darling, you\r\nshall indeed try, and I shall instruct you as we advance how to obtain\r\nthe greatest amount of pleasure from our libidinous and lascivious\r\nenjoyments, delights that are without risk, and from which we shall have\r\nno anxieties as to fatal results, which are the consequence of\r\nconnection with the opposite sex, who only make use of us for their own\r\nsensual enjoyment, and abandon us at the very moment they ought to\r\nconsole and cherish us the most.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt, again embracing me tenderly, threw herself in the same\r\nposition I had previously lay in. I knelt on the cushion as she had\r\ndone. But before proceeding to do as she had done to me, I could not\r\nhelp pausing to gaze with delight on her natural charms. Oh! dear Harry,\r\nyou cannot imagine the beauty of that part of your mamma. Her stomach is\r\nof the purest white, smooth and firm, round and beautiful. Below a\r\ncrease commences a large plumped out swelling seen through the fair and\r\nthick silky curls that so much adorn it, then grandly rounded sinks down\r\nbetween her thighs, and the beautifully pouting lips rise richly\r\ntempting through the thickest of hair, that goes far beyond between the\r\nlarge rounded orbs that project behind. At the upper part of the lips,\r\nwhere they form a deep indented half-circle, I could distinguish a stiff\r\nprojecting object, as long and thicker than my thumb. I now know that\r\nthis is the centre of exquisite joy. Your mother had since taught me to\r\ncall it her clitoris, and says that although seldom so strongly\r\ndeveloped as in her case, it exists in every woman and becomes stiff and\r\nexcited as the final crisis of joy approaches. I glued my lips around\r\nthis charming object, and sucked it, and played with my tongue around\r\nits point. Your mother, in an ecstasy of delight, wriggled her bottom\r\nbelow me, and with both hands pressing my head down on the excited\r\npoint, gave utterance to the most loving and sensual expressions. She\r\nbegged me to pass the flat of my hand under my chin, and introduce my\r\nthumb within the lips below, where I was sucking, and move it backwards\r\nand forwards as much as I could. I did so, and immediately found that it\r\nadded greatly to your mother\xe2\x80\x99s delight. Faster and faster grew her\r\nmovements, until, with a cry of delight, a firm pressure of my hand\r\nagainst her affair, and still firmer pressure on my thumb, she suddenly\r\nceased all movement, her hands relaxed their hold of my head, the\r\nstiffness left her clitoris, and beyond convulsive graspings of the\r\ninterior of her affair upon my thumb, she lay for some time inanimate.\r\nAt last she recovered her senses, she seized me under the arms, and drew\r\nme upon her belly, her hands pressed my bottom down close upon her\r\nperson, until I found that my affair was nestled in the rich profusion\r\nof curls that so finely adorned hers. She thrust her tongue into my\r\nmouth, and sucked off all the rich creamy substance that had flowed from\r\nher in such abundance. She blessed the happy chance that had led her to\r\ngive me her confidence; told me that for long she had only enjoyed the\r\nunsatisfactory delight of lonely self-gratification, and said that now\r\nwe should revel in mutual delight of every sensual indulgence that woman\r\ncan have with woman. We lay for some time enjoying such delicious\r\ncommunings, until compelled to rise by the lateness of the hour. We have\r\nsince practised every method of enjoyment given to two of the same sex.\r\nYour mother has often introduced her stiff excited clitoris within the\r\nlips of my affair as far as it would go, but I have always longed, my\r\ndear Harry, for you to penetrate still further with that larger and\r\nlonger thing you have got, although what I have seen today of its\r\nincreased size has made me greatly fear it can never get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus ended her ingenuous description. Harry, of course, promised that he\r\nwould never hurt her, that those parts were made to yield, that,\r\ndoubtless, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s large clitoris had hurt her at first, but had\r\ngiven her great pleasure afterwards.\r\n\r\nYes, that was so, and it was that that gave her courage, and if they\r\ncould only get the opportunity she would allow him to do anything he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed this account of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s intercourse with her\r\naunt fired my imagination and made me resolve to have her. Indeed, I\r\nbegan to conceive that there would be no occasion for me to make any\r\neffort, that all would be done by dear mamma herself. We had returned to\r\nthe house after this agitated walk. Mamma was evidently greatly\r\npreoccupied, but at length she appeared to have come to a final\r\ndetermination, for she told Ellen to go up to her room, and begged us\r\ntwo boys, as she called us, to go out and amuse ourselves for an hour.\r\nIt was during this interval that Harry narrated his interesting\r\nconversation with his cousin. Her lively description had set his\r\nimagination on fire, and he now declared his regret that it was not to\r\nbe he who would enjoy his lasciviously sensual mother. Neither of us had\r\nany doubt but that she would now find an opportunity of enjoying me. If\r\nwe had, our doubts were solved on re-entering the house. Mamma first,\r\nfor form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, kissing her son, and then far more warmly kissing me,\r\ninformed us that she had written to the doctor that we had been such\r\ngood boys that she would feel greatly obliged if he would allow her son\r\nto remain with her until Monday, and also leave his nephew to keep him\r\ncompany and prevent any of his former misbehaviour which, she was happy\r\nto say, he appeared to have forgotten, but still it would be better he\r\nshould have the safeguard of so intelligent and discreet a friend as she\r\nwas glad to see he had found in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s nephew. My uncle, without\r\nknowing exactly what to make of this note, had consented. Hence her joy\r\nin being able to communicate the pleasing intelligence\xe2\x80\x94doubly so to me,\r\nas I immediately augured the downfall of my assumed virginity. Dear\r\nmamma was all radiant with joy, and conveyed me at once to where she\r\nintended I should sleep. I marked that it was in an out of the way room,\r\neasy of access, but not likely to be interfered with by passers-by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here, my dear son, for you know in future you are always to call me\r\nmamma, I hope you will find yourself comfortable, and that you will not\r\nbe alarmed because you are in an out of the way part of the house, but\r\nin case you should, before I go to bed, I shall come to see that you are\r\ncomfortably asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere she kissed and embraced me warmly. I repaid her most\r\naffectionately, but apparently in all innocence. She sighed, as I\r\nthought with regret, that she could not at that moment go further, and\r\nthen led me away.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon, the dinner, and the evening passed away without anything\r\nworthy of remark, except that mamma was frequently absent and\r\npreoccupied. She sat by me on the sofa while Ellen played to us; her\r\nhand sought mine, and frequently squeezed it affectionately. Harry sat\r\nby Ellen, which enabled me often to raise my head and pout my lips for a\r\nkiss in a boyish way. It was never refused. She dwelt on my mouth\r\nsensuously with half-opened lips, but apparently afraid to tip me the\r\nvelvet of her tongue. She frequently gave a shudder and trembled, and\r\nwas evidently greatly excited. In the course of the afternoon, Harry and\r\nI had had an opportunity of exchanging ideas. I told him I was certain\r\nhis mother would come to me that night, and he might be sure if she did\r\nthat she would remain till daylight. I advised him to watch her, and\r\nwhen he saw her leave her bedroom to come to me, then he could slip into\r\nhis cousin\xe2\x80\x99s room, and effect his purpose, but to be sure to retire at\r\nthe first dawn. I said that if that time his mother wanted to leave me,\r\nI would keep her another quarter of an hour to enable him to put matters\r\nto rights with his cousin, and regain his own room. I advised him also\r\nto put a towel under his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, as he was sure to make her\r\nbleed, and he must take it away in the morning to prevent any traces of\r\nwhat he had done being perceived by his mother, and to tell Ellen to\r\nfeign deep sleep on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s return, and to appear quite unconscious\r\nin the morning of her aunt having been absent. A little before ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock mamma thought it time for her children, as she called us, to go\r\nto bed. Her son and niece both kissed her, and I, too, claimed a kiss of\r\nmy new mamma. It was taken and returned in quite a passionate way, her\r\nlips seemed loath to leave mine, and her arms encircled me in a very\r\nloving embrace. \xe2\x80\x9cDear mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall love you ever dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling boy, I already love you as if you were indeed my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sent the others to their bedrooms, but escorted me herself to mine.\r\nI could see that she trembled greatly, and was evidently glad to put\r\ndown the candlestick. She turned down the bedclothes for me, hoped I\r\nwould sleep well, and, with considerable agitation, again embraced me\r\nmost passionately. I could feel that her tongue would fain have thrust\r\nitself between my lips. I had great difficulty in restraining myself,\r\nbut somehow I managed to do so. She at last left me, saying she would\r\ngive a look in to see that I was comfortable before she herself went to\r\nbed. I told her it was very kind of her, but that there was no necessity\r\nfor her doing so, as I always went to sleep like a top the moment I lay\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that, my dear child, but nevertheless I will look in, lest\r\nthe strange bed should prevent your sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again she hugged me passionately against her firm and well-formed\r\nbosom, kissing me with a long, long kiss. Quitting me with a deep sigh,\r\nat last she said good night, and shut the door, apparently going away.\r\nBut I fancied that she stopped short, and that I could hear her gently\r\nstealing back, probably in the hope of seeing me undress, and of\r\ncatching a view of my huge pego. So I determined she should have her\r\ncuriosity indulged. I hurried off my clothes, and before putting on one\r\nof Harry\xe2\x80\x99s nightshirts, which had been laid on the bed for me, I took up\r\nthe chamber pot, and turned fronting the key hole, stark naked, and cock\r\nin hand. It was at half-cock, but when I had piddled I made it throb and\r\nraise its head, and gave it a rub or two, and a shake very deliberately,\r\nso that she might be still more bent on possessing it. I took up the\r\nnightshirt, and turning to the light, was very awkward in getting it on,\r\nso as to give time for a good sight of my prick at full stand against my\r\nbelly. I then blew out the light, and tumbled into bed very quickly. I\r\nlistened attentively, and could hear a deep half-suppressed sigh, and\r\nthen footsteps stealing quietly away. I lay awake cogitating as to how I\r\nshould receive her, whether to feign profound sleep, and so let her take\r\nall the initiative, or whether to pretend that the novelty of the bed,\r\nand thinking over her affectionate kindness to me had kept me awake. I\r\ndecided upon pretending to be sound asleep, chiefly that I might see how\r\nshe would carry out her designs, and also as allowing me to play the\r\nsurprised one.\r\n\r\nIn little more than half an hour after all had retired to rest I saw the\r\nglimmer of light through the key hole. I had studied a pose that would\r\nfacilitate matters. I lay on my back, the clothes partially thrown off\r\nmy breast, and the hand next to the side on which she must approach,\r\nplaced above my head. Of course my cock was at full stand and as I had\r\nthrown off the heavy counterpane, it easily lifted up, and bulged out\r\nthe sheet and light blanket. I closed my eyes, and breathed heavily. The\r\ndoor was gently opened, and she entered. She turned to close it, and I\r\ngave a peep through a half-opened eye, and saw that she had only on a\r\nloose _robe de chambre_, which was thrown open in turning, so that I\r\ncould see there was nothing but her shift below. I even caught sight of\r\nher beautiful bosom, which at once caused my prick to throb almost to\r\nbursting, so that when she came to my side, it stood up most manfully.\r\nShe paused, evidently intent on the sight. She then held the light\r\ntowards me, and spoke in an undertone, asking me if I was awake. Of\r\ncourse I only breathed the heavier, and lay with my mouth half open, as\r\nif in the very deepest first slumber. She then turned her attention to\r\nthe bulging-out substance, and ventured to touch it gently; then,\r\ngrowing bolder, she still more gently grasped it from above the clothes,\r\nand then turned the light on my face, but I gave not a sign. She then\r\nput the candle down, and, taking a chair, sat down close to the bed.\r\nHere she again spoke to me in a subdued tone. Finding no cessation of\r\nthe deep breathing, she gently insinuated her hand below the already\r\nfavourably turned-down bedclothes, and with great care slipped it down\r\nto my prick, which she grasped softly. I could now feel her whole body\r\ntremble, her breath came fast and short. She passed her hand gently up\r\nfrom the root to the head, its size evidently greatly exciting her. When\r\nshe grasped the head, it gave a powerful throb. She eased her hand, and,\r\nI felt certain, turned to see if it had disturbed me. But I slept on\r\nprofoundly. She seemed to gain more confidence, for both hands were now\r\napplied, and it was evident she had assumed a kneeling posture, the\r\nbetter to favour her designs. I could feel her pass one hand over the\r\nother, until she found the head was still partially above the third\r\ngrasp. I heard her give an involuntary exclamation of surprise at its\r\nsize. Her curiosity growing by what it fed on, she now commenced with\r\nthe utmost caution gently to remove the bedclothes, that she might see,\r\nas well as feel. When this was accomplished, she rose and brought the\r\nlight, again passed it before my eyes, and then moved it down towards my\r\nprick. Being sure she was now far too deeply engaged to turn her eyes\r\ntowards mine, I half opened them, and beheld her bending close over the\r\ngreat object of attraction. I heard her exclaim half aloud\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow wonderful! I never could have imagined such a thing, and in such an\r\ninnocent boy, too. Oh! I must possess\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I must possess it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere she grasped it more forcibly than before. Then, rising, she put the\r\ncandle on the pot stand, which she removed to the foot of the bed. Then\r\ntaking my prick in both hands, she gently rubbed it up and down, and\r\neven stooped and fondly kissed the nut. It throbbed more violently than\r\never at this, and I thought it time to start, and appear to awake. She\r\ninstantly quitted her hold of it, and stood up, but was too agitated to\r\nthink of covering me. I opened my eyes in apparent great surprise, but\r\nrecognising mamma, I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! is that you, dear mamma? I was dreaming such a nice dream about\r\nyou. Oh, do kiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d purposely not seeming to know that my person was\r\nall naked.\r\n\r\nShe stooped and kissed me tenderly, saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, darling boy. I came to see if you were comfortable, and found\r\nyou lying uncovered, and with this extraordinary thing sticking up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had seized it with her left hand, as she stooped to kiss me. On the\r\ninstant, I determined to play off the same game that had succeeded so\r\nwell with my aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear mamma, I should not have dared to speak to you about _that_,\r\nbut it does give me much pain, by becoming so hard that it throbs, as\r\nyou may feel, at the least touch. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do; and it makes\r\nme feel so queer too, especially at the gentle pressures you have just\r\ngiven it; dear mamma, can you tell me how I can cure it, and I will love\r\nyou so dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere she stooped and kissed me very luxuriously, actually thrusting her\r\ntongue into my mouth. I sucked it, and told her how sweet it was. But my\r\nprick becoming perfectly outrageous, I implored her to tell me what I\r\ncould do to relieve it. She looked at me long and intently, blushing and\r\nturning pale by turns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear boy, I could relieve you, but it is a secret that I hardly\r\ndare confide in one so young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you may trust me, my dear mamma, you know I am becoming a young\r\nman, and men must know how to keep secrets, or they would be despised,\r\nbesides, so dear and loving a mamma as you are to me would doubly make\r\nme keep secret anything you confide to me on those terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will trust you, my darling boy, but you will at once see by what I\r\nshall do, how completely I sacrifice myself to do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon this, she threw off her robe, and sprang into bed by my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how nice of you, dear mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as I took her in my arms, and\r\nkissed her lovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cFeel, mamma, how much harder it is, so tell me at\r\nonce how I am to relieve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear child, we women are made to relieve such stiffnesses as\r\nthis; we possess a sheath to put it in, and then it gradually softens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! where\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x94dearest mamma, do tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took my hand and put it down on her cunt, already quite wet with the\r\nexcitement she had been in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, feel that, do you not find an opening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, but how am I to get in there\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t it hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned on her back, opened her legs, and desired me to mount on her\r\nbelly, with my legs between hers, then guiding my rampant pego, and\r\nrubbing its great head up and down the lips to moisten it, she told me\r\nto push gently downwards, for it was so large that I would otherwise\r\nhurt her. Playing the novice to perfection, I awkwardly but gently soon\r\nthrust it in, up to the codpiece. She uttered an \xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d when it was\r\nfairly hilted; then throwing her legs over my loins, and her arms round\r\nmy waist, she begged me to move my bottom backwards and forwards, always\r\nthrusting it in as far as I could. Three or four pushes finished me off,\r\nin the great excitement I was under. She, too, died away with a great\r\nconvulsive sigh. I took care to cry out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear mamma\xe2\x80\x94oh! stop. I am dying\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94am dy\xe2\x80\x94dy\xe2\x80\x94ing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer convulsive internal pressures were delicious, and quickly roused my\r\nprick up again. She also had come to, and had glued her lips to\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94giving her own, and then asking in return for my tongue to suck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what heavenly joys, my dear mamma, you did, indeed, reduce its\r\nhardness, but just feel\xe2\x80\x94it has got hard again, you must reduce it once\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy beloved boy, I shall always be ready to do so, but it must be the\r\nmost sacred secret between us, or I should never be able to do it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou may well suppose my protestations were of the strongest. At it we\r\nwent again, and again, and again. Mamma declared that I was a most apt\r\nscholar. Four times did I pour into her foaming and fiery cunt torrents\r\nof sperm. At last she insisted upon my withdrawing, saying it would\r\ninjure my health to indulge any more. So I withdrew, and we embraced\r\neach other most lovingly. I now expressed a wish to see the wonderful\r\nplace that had given me the ecstasies of paradise. She lent herself with\r\nadmirable grace and ease to my boyish curiosity, and even threw off her\r\nshift, making me do the same, that she too might admire the undisguised\r\nbeauties of my form. There was no pretence in the great admiration I\r\nexpressed for her really superb form, but I expressed it in a naive and\r\ninnocent way, that made her laugh heartily, and confirmed her idea that\r\nshe was not only the first naked woman I had seen, but that she was the\r\nfirst I ever knew, or who had taught me what sensual pleasure meant, and\r\ngreat was her delight in thinking she had taken my virginity, and been\r\nthe first to initiate me in love\xe2\x80\x99s delightful mysteries. Of course, I\r\ndid everything I could in order to carry on the deception she was so\r\nmuch pleased with, and I may add this was the last time I ever did so,\r\nfor daily becoming more of a man, I took _things_ by the forelock at\r\nonce, and rarely failed to succeed. We got up, and she turned herself\r\nround in every way for me to see the rare beauties of her person\xe2\x80\x94herself\r\nexplaining to me where she was well made\xe2\x80\x94bosom, buttocks, belly so white\r\nand smooth, without a wrinkle, although she had had a son. She was,\r\nindeed, one of those rare cases where nothing remains to tell of such an\r\nevent. Her bosom, without being so large as aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, was gloriously white\r\nand firm, with such pink nipples, larger than in a maid, but sticking\r\nout hard and inviting a suck. Then her cunt\xe2\x80\x94for she laid herself on her\r\nback, opened her legs, and allowed me the closest inspection. I have\r\nalready alluded to her clitoris, as described by Ellen to Harry; it was\r\ncharmingly developed, about half the length of Miss Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s, and not\r\nso thick. As I felt her cunt and introduced my fingers to hold it open,\r\nshe got excited, and Master Clitoris raised his head, and came out of\r\nhis corner in full stand. I professed great surprise to find she had a\r\nlittle doodle of her own. I purposely used the boyish expression. I\r\nbegan to play with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must kiss it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so, and began to suck it. She got dreadfully lewd, and seizing\r\nupon my now-again-standing prick, drew me upon her, and introduced once\r\nmore my master weapon. With greater slowness until the final crisis drew\r\nnear, we had another delicious fuck. She was a woman of very warm\r\npassions, and the long pent-up seclusion she had kept herself in with\r\nregard to our sex being once broken, now that the flood-gates were\r\nopened, there was no resisting the torrent of her lascivious passions.\r\nTwice again did we fuck without withdrawing. Then, after hugging and\r\nthanking me for the ecstasies I threw her into, she rose for a natural\r\npurpose, and advised me to do the same, and we would then both lave\r\nourselves with cold water to restore our nerves. She laved me and I her.\r\nShe then insisted on my lying down on my back, while she admired what\r\nshe called the masterpiece of Nature. From seeing and feeling, she soon\r\ncame to sucking. Up he got in a moment. Playing the ignoramus, I asked\r\nif it was not possible that we could both enjoy that pleasure at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my dear boy. I am so delighted to find that this pleases you!\r\nLie on your back, I shall get over you in the reverse way, and while I\r\nsuck this enormous jewel, whose head I can hardly get into my mouth, you\r\nshall do as you like with my notch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you call it, dear mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is one name, and it has many others, but you men generally call it\r\ncunt, as we call yours prick, it is just as well you should know their\r\nordinary names, as children only call them Fanny and Doodle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrick and cunt\xe2\x80\x94oh! I shan\xe2\x80\x99t forget, so let me have that beautiful cunt\r\nto suck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had a mutual gamahuche, and both greedily swallowed the double\r\nresult, and continued our caresses of both parts, until they were again\r\nin full vigour, and inspired with a desire for more solid enjoyments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling boy, you are so apt and excellent a scholar that I must show\r\nyou there are several ways of allaying the stiffness of this dear\r\nfellow, who seems as desirous as ever to have his hardness taken out of\r\nhim. I shall show you how my husband liked best to enjoy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe scrambled up on her knees, and presented her very fine bottom, told\r\nme to kneel behind and give her my prick in her hand, which she thrust\r\nout backwards between her thighs. I did so. She told me it would appear\r\nto get further in this way, and, in fact, it did. After it was all in\r\nuntil thighs and buttocks met, she told me to admire, praise, and handle\r\nthe splendid cheeks of her bottom, and said that such praise greatly\r\nexcited her. Of course I did so, admiring not only their size and\r\nfairness, but also the beautiful curly silk meshes that ran between the\r\ncheeks, covered her beautifully pink bottom-hole, charmingly puckered as\r\nit was, and ran up to the flat of her back. After I had so excited her,\r\nshe begged me to lean forward, and to handle one bubby while I should\r\nplay with her clitoris with the other hand. I did all this tolerably\r\nwell, but with somewhat of awkwardness. She said I would soon be\r\nperfect. We ran again two courses before she fell forward dragging me\r\ndown without withdrawing, and then turning on our sides, still\r\nintertwined we fell off into a deep slumber, and did not awaken till\r\ndaylight. Mamma jumped out of bed, unseating me by the act. She was\r\nalarmed lest the hour should be late enough for the household to be up.\r\nI tried hard to persuade her to reduce once more the hardness which had\r\nagain seized me as she might see and feel for herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear boy, we must not be imprudent, my niece may have awakened\r\nand grown anxious at my absence, and she may rise to seek me; so\r\ngood-bye, my darling, go to sleep again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe embraced me tenderly, but I could not prevail upon her to go\r\nfurther, although she promised to seek an opportunity during the day,\r\nand to give me as much as I liked the next night. She left me, and I\r\npondered over the lucky chance that had put so desirable and fine a\r\nwoman into my arms, and also congratulated myself on the stratagem by\r\nwhich I had fully convinced her that she was my first instructress in\r\nthe art of love, a circumstance ever dear to the ardent imagination of\r\nthe darling sex. I easily fell asleep again, wondering how Harry in the\r\nmeantime had got on with his cousin. My dear mamma would not allow me to\r\nbe disturbed. She had entered my room once or twice, and found me\r\nsleeping soundly.\r\n\r\nAt last she again entered, just as I had satisfied a natural want for\r\nwhich I had risen. To rush to her, to embrace her tenderly, to fasten\r\nthe door, and compel her, not much against her will, to come towards the\r\nbed, to beg her to lie on her belly on the bedside, to cant her\r\npetticoats up, to kneel and gamahuche her cunt from behind until she\r\nbegged me to rise and fuck her, was but the work of a minute or two. And\r\nthen my stiff-standing pego, aided by the mouthful of thick saliva\r\noccasioned by the gamahuche, was directed at her cunt, and driven home\r\nas far as the buttocks or her fine backside would allow. My prick being\r\nfairly sheathed, I paused for a moment to handle and praise the beauty\r\nof her posterior orbs. Then, stooping, I nibbled at her bubbies with one\r\nhand, and frigged her clitoris with the other. Sharp set, with my long\r\nrest and refreshing sleep, I rapidly ran a first course, but not quicker\r\nthan the lascivious nature of dear mamma, who joined me in a copious\r\ndischarge with the most ecstatic joy, and the most delicious inward\r\npressures. For she was a perfect and most accomplished actor in the\r\ncombats of love, and in her own way was worthy of my glorious aunt and\r\nmy loved Miss Frankland, and as thoroughly accomplished as they in all\r\nthe abandon of lust and lubricity, although at the moment I had only\r\nproved things in an ordinary way. Her exquisite internal suctions almost\r\nprevented the slightest relaxation in my delighted pego, and after a\r\nminute or two of indulgence in the after-joy, I began again almost\r\nbefore dear mamma had recovered her senses, when she tried to tear\r\nherself away. But before she knew where she was I had succeeded in again\r\nfiring her ardent and lascivious nature, and she became as eager for a\r\nsecond course as myself. This was naturally longer than the first fiery\r\none. I raised myself upright on my knees, contemplated with the utmost\r\ndelight the uncommon active play of her loins, and the exquisite side\r\nwriggling of her very fine backside. I loudly praised her delicious\r\nmanoeuvres, and seconded them to the utmost, until getting more and more\r\nexcited, fast and furious grew our movements. I bent down to second her\r\nby frigging her clitoris, and the final crisis seized us both with its\r\nagony of joy, and I sank almost insensible on her back. We lay for a\r\nshort time lost to everything, until mamma, remembering the risk we ran\r\nof discovery, begged me to withdraw, and let her go away. She rose and\r\nthrew herself into my arms, glueing her lips to mine with a most loving\r\nkiss. Then stooping, she gave my now pendant prick a most delicious\r\nsuck, making her tongue play into and around the mouth of the urethra.\r\nThis was so delicious that the delighted member instantly showed its\r\nappreciation of the pleasure by starting up in full swing. Mamma gave it\r\na pat, and said he was a most charming and delicious boy, who did not\r\nknow how to behave himself. Again she kissed me, and tore herself away,\r\nbut I could easily see the regret was as great on her side as mine. She\r\ntold me her son had been as lazy as I was, and said that breakfast was\r\nwaiting for us both. I quickly finished my toilet and found them all at\r\nthe breakfast table.\r\n\r\nEllen blushed deeply when she saw me. A glance from Harry assured me he\r\nhad succeeded, and that Ellen not only knew what I had been about, but\r\nalso that I knew what she had been doing. Hence her high colour when she\r\nsaw me. I smiled, and nodded to her knowingly, and as she had observed\r\nthe intelligent glance that passed between Harry and me, it did not tend\r\nto put her at her ease.\r\n\r\nMamma, of course, knew nothing of what had passed in her bed while she\r\nwas with me, and was all affectionate attention to the whole party, but\r\nwith a marked tendency to pay me more particular attention. Our\r\nbreakfast was late, so we had to hurry ourselves for church. Mamma drove\r\nEllen in a small pony phaeton, while Harry and I took a short cut across\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nHarry told me how he had watched his mother and had quietly approached\r\nmy door, and as the bed was exactly opposite the key hole, had seen and\r\nenjoyed her proceedings, especially as he knew that I only pretended\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a fine woman mother is! I could not tear\r\nmyself away, and remained until you both went at it again, stark naked.\r\nMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful hairy cunt, fine bubbies and backside, nearly\r\ndrove me mad with desire. I could have violated her if she had been\r\nalone. And, then, her energy in fucking was superb. I could hold out no\r\nlonger, but rushed to dear Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s side. She was asleep. I took her in\r\nmy arms, and awoke her by feeling her delicious young cunt. She opened\r\nher eyes, and thinking it was mamma she turned round to repay the\r\ncompliment, and started on having hold of my pego.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why! Harry dear, how came you here? We shall be caught by mamma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, my love, mamma is better engaged, and has slipped away to\r\nCharlie\xe2\x80\x99s room to get done to her what I am going to do to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was too much alarmed to believe me, and I was obliged to bring her\r\nto your door. I first peeped, and saw you were still at it. Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s legs\r\nand arms thrown around you allowed me to see your great big thing\r\nrushing in and out, and driving home with immense vigour. I whispered to\r\nEllen to peep. While she did so, stooping, I sat down on the floor and\r\ngamahuched her. She spent almost immediately, and was so excited that it\r\nquite filled my mouth. I rose on my legs, and bringing my prick against\r\nher cunt, made an entrance as far as over the nut, but was myself so\r\nexcited with all I was doing, and all I had previously seen, that I went\r\noff in an agony of delight and with a suppressed cry, which must have\r\nbeen heard by you and mamma if you had not been so busily engaged. Ellen\r\nhad been so excited and so intent on the to her new scene enacting\r\nbefore her eyes, that she had never ceased gazing on it, and left me to\r\ndo whatever I pleased, but my cry alarmed her, especially as in my last\r\nforward push I had sent her head with some noise against the door. She\r\nrose, and so unseated me from the slight hold I had got of her cunt. She\r\nturned round to embrace me most excitedly, and whispered that we must go\r\nelsewhere. I took her round the waist, and we quickly regained mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed. The light enabled me to find a towel. I told Ellen it was to\r\nprevent any moisture betraying our acts. She was far too excited and\r\nwishful for the article to make the slightest resistance, or even\r\npretence of refusal. I begged her to throw off her shift, as she had\r\nseen both Charlie and mamma were quite naked. She at once complied,\r\nbeing now as eager for the fray as myself. I, too, threw off my\r\nnightshirt. For a moment we embraced each other\xe2\x80\x99s naked bodies. My cock\r\nwas as stiff as iron. She lewdly laid hold of it, while I handled her\r\ncharming young cunt. I helped her onto the bed, she at once lay down on\r\nher back, and threw open her legs as she had seen mamma do. I stopped\r\nand gave her cunt, all oozing with her own and my spunk, a warm kiss,\r\nand with a lick or two on her budding clitoris, I fired her even to\r\ngreater excess than she had yet been in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, come to my arms, my dear Harry, and let us do as they were so\r\ndelightedly doing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had noted with what rapture mamma was enjoying you, and she had\r\nnoted, too, what a much larger cock yours was than mine; so she had\r\nnaturally reasoned that if one so big gave her aunt so much delight,\r\nmy smaller one could not possibly hurt her, hence her eagerness to\r\nhave me at once. I did not baulk her, but throwing myself between her\r\nwide-spread thighs, I soon brought the point of my prick to the longing\r\nlips of her little virgin cunt. I rubbed it up and down in between\r\nthe pouting and self-opened lips, partly to moisten it, and partly\r\nto still more excite her lust. I then gently pressed it forward, and\r\nintroduced just its head, and drawing it in and out, made her beg me to\r\ngo further. I did so, slowly, until I found there was an impediment. I\r\nknew that I must burst through this and that it would hurt her, so I\r\ncontinued withdrawing and re-entering without going further until she\r\nbecame so voraciously lewd as to throw her legs around my loins and\r\nheave her bottom up to meet my thrusts. I seized the fortunate moment\r\nand with one downright violent thrust burst through every barrier and\r\nburied my prick in her up to the very hilt. The attack and its result\r\nwas so unexpected by Ellen that when she felt the knife-like thrust\r\nof agony she gave a shriek of pain, and made an immediate effort to\r\nthrow me off. I was too firmly seated for any other result of her\r\nstruggles than the still more complete rupture of her maidenhead, which\r\nmy forward thrust had partially effected. I lay for some time quite\r\ntranquil, and when her immediate pain wore off I commenced a gentle\r\nin and out movement, which, without exactly exciting her, produced a\r\npleasing sensation. I then went on faster and faster until the crisis\r\ncame upon me, and I shot into her a torrent of boiling sperm that by\r\nits balmy nature mollified the previous smarting; so that when I had\r\nrecovered from the delicious ecstasies of my first success, and my\r\nprick gradually resumed its former vigour, I found by the somewhat\r\nincreased pressure upon it that her passions were re-awakening. Three\r\ntimes did I fuck her before I withdrew, the last one appeared to give\r\nher more pleasure, but still she complained of a smarting pain as I\r\npassed over and over the shattered hymen. I advised her to rise and\r\nlave herself as a relief, and to wash away the stains of blood from\r\nher thighs. The towel was a fortunate thought on your part, but, in\r\nfact, I had followed in all my movements the sage counsels you had\r\ngiven me from the experience you had had in taking the virginities\r\nof Mrs. Vincent and your two sisters, or I should otherwise probably\r\nhave bungled the matter, although my experience with your magnificent\r\naunt had naturally put me up to all the art of fucking. I had some\r\ndifficulty in persuading Ellen to let me put it in again, as she\r\ndeclared she had endured perfect agony when I broke through her\r\nmaidenhead. However, I gamahuched her well, got her passions up,\r\nmoistened the shaft well, and was very gentle in entering and in my\r\nfirst movements. I spent without making her do so. But the well-greased\r\nsheath now allowing more easy movements, she gave down her nature with\r\nconsiderable pleasure as I spent the second time. Still there was fear\r\nand restraint\xe2\x80\x94fear lest mamma might come back\xe2\x80\x94so I thought it advisable\r\nto retire to my own room, being quite certain that now the road is open\r\nher lascivious nature will not be long in enabling her to enjoy the\r\nsport to the utmost. By the way, she could not help wondering how mamma\r\ncould take in your immense pego; why, she said, it was as thick as her\r\nwrist and much longer than her hand, and yet it seemed to slip into\r\nmamma with ease and pleasure, \xe2\x80\x98while yours, dear Harry, which is not\r\nthicker than my two forefingers, and hardly much longer, has given me\r\nsuch pain.\xe2\x80\x99 I assured her it was only for the first night, and that if\r\nshe would bathe it with warm water two or three times during the day,\r\nand put up a little glycerine as far as where it hurt, which her finger\r\ncould easily reach, she would find that tomorrow night there would no\r\nlonger be any pain felt, and she would enjoy it as much as she had seen\r\nmamma do. With this advice I left her to her repose, and gained my own\r\nroom unobserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this we concerted together as to what we should say to the doctor,\r\nwho was sure to question us. Mrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s cottage was not in our parish,\r\nbut she had driven over to our church, partly to throw off all suspicion\r\nfrom the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and also to thank him for allowing us to stay\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, knew that we should have to go to the rectory and stay\r\nfor luncheon. We agreed that we should not on this occasion take the\r\ndoctor into our confidence, but that we should tell him we had purposely\r\nbeen very quiet and discreet, so as to throw Harry\xe2\x80\x99s mother off her\r\nguard. That Ellen slept with her, so that it became doubly necessary to\r\ngain her confidence. This being arranged before we reached church, we\r\nentered. After service we all adjourned to the rectory. The doctor\r\nescorted Mrs. Dale, Harry, Ellen, and I my aunt. Aunt, pressing my arm,\r\nasked me if I had had Mrs. D., as she seemed a fine woman worth having.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear no. I have had no opportunity, even if she would have\r\nconsented. I have been playing the ingenuous youth to help Harry with\r\nhis cousin. I thought we had somewhat thrown her off her guard, but she\r\nwas still jealous and watched him closely. Ellen slept with her, which\r\nrendered things more difficult for Harry. She has closely examined me as\r\nto the sort of intimacy existing between us. I threw such an air of\r\ncandour and innocence over my replies that she was quite delighted Harry\r\nhad met with such a companion. I fully expect she will break out in\r\npraises of my _modest_ and discreet conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, so it turned out, and Mrs. Dale did it with such an air of\r\ncandour that aunt was quite convinced nothing as yet had occurred\r\nbetween us. While the ladies discussed the dresses and bonnets of all\r\nwho had appeared in church, uncle took Harry and me for a walk in the\r\ngarden until luncheon was ready. Here he began, as aunt had done, to\r\nquestion us as to our proceedings, and the reason for Mrs. D. asking\r\npermission for us to stay. The same replies that had satisfied aunt\r\nsatisfied him that nothing as yet had taken place beyond my gaining the\r\nconfidence of Mrs. D.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have only now to manage somehow or\r\nother to let her see your great big cock without apparently your being\r\naware of it, and I will warrant, from my knowledge of woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature,\r\nthat she will find a way to have you, only mind you play the innocent,\r\nand be very awkward, and let her appear to teach you, which will give\r\ndouble pleasure and prevent any questioning as to how you have gained\r\nyour instruction, if she thought you instructed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI smiled inwardly at these sage directions, and thought how completely\r\nall persons knowing in the ways of the world gave the same advice. But\r\nlittle did uncle then think that I had acted up to the very letter what\r\nhe was advising for my future conduct. We re-entered the house on\r\nluncheon bell ringing. Mrs. Dale complimented the doctor on the advance\r\nher son had made both in manners and instruction, and quite naturally\r\ncongratulated herself on his finding so very modest and gentlemanly a\r\ncompanion in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s nephew\xe2\x80\x94myself to wit.\r\n\r\nReturning home, Ellen begged she might be allowed to walk, doubtless\r\ncalculating on having Harry for a companion. But mamma, while agreeing\r\nto her request, was still sufficiently on her guard to take Harry in the\r\nphaeton, and leave me to escort Ellen. Here was a chance! Ellen blushed,\r\nbut took my arm as we left the rectory. Uncle gave me a knowing look,\r\nand a glance at Ellen, as we parted, as much as to say, I guess what\r\nwill happen. We walked away steadily enough until the first hedge hid\r\nus. I stopped, and embraced Ellen tenderly, saying how glad I was to be\r\nable to congratulate her on the happy chance her aunt had given her, by\r\ncoming to me for the night. She was a good deal confused at thinking\r\nthat I should know how she passed the night. I rallied her upon this,\r\ntold her that no secret existed between Harry and me, and that, in fact,\r\nif I had not lent myself to the game, she would not have had the\r\nopportunity for the great pleasure she must have had in Harry\xe2\x80\x99s arms. I\r\nknew she had not had much, but I wished to draw her on, and to make her\r\nopen out as to her feelings, being determined to make the most of any\r\nconfidence on her part. She replied that, indeed, she had done nothing\r\nbut suffer, and would not have allowed Harry to do what he did if she\r\nhad known the pain it would give her, she had been deceived by seeing\r\nhow much aunt had seemed to enjoy what was so greatly superior in size\r\nto what Harry had. I smiled at her allusion to the size of my pego, and\r\nknowing that her curiosity must be creating in her a desire to see it, I\r\ntold her it was well for her, in the first instance, to have had the\r\nsmaller weapon to penetrate her, and that now she would never again\r\nsuffer, even by the introduction of so large a one as mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but when I think of the immense size of yours, I could never dare\r\nto allow you to try, although aunt did seem to enjoy it, when you pushed\r\nit in with such force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Ellen, it was the size alone that tempted mamma, and if I had\r\nnot been larger than Harry, I doubt if ever she would have come to me at\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how could she dare to do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCuriosity to enjoy an unusually large cock, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know she was coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and no. I saw that her passions were excited, when I had once\r\n_accidentally_ allowed her to see my large proportions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Harry told me what you were about, but I hardly expected aunt\r\nwould have dared to come to you\xe2\x80\x94how did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you will promise _never_ to let your aunt know that I have\r\ntold, I shall tell you. She came and found me _apparently_ asleep, first\r\nfelt me, and seeing I did not awake, carefully uncovered me, looked at,\r\nhandled and kissed it, upon which, as my cock was nearly bursting, and I\r\ncould stand it no longer, I awoke, and innocently complained of the\r\nstiffness I suffered from in that part, and begged her to tell me if\r\nthere was any means of relieving it. She told me there was, but it was a\r\ngreat secret she hardly dared trust me with\xe2\x80\x94and even if she could do so,\r\nshe was afraid of a great long thing like _that_, three of her hands\r\nlong below the head! but that if I promised secrecy, she would try. Then\r\nshe lay down and taught me how to put it in, and I know you afterwards\r\nenjoyed the sight of our being in full action, quite naked\xe2\x80\x94did you not\r\nenjoy it, dear Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear Charlie, it was very exciting, and made me feel queer all\r\nover; but is it really three hands and a head long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was delighted at the question, as it showed me she was ready for what\r\nI intended should be done. Curiosity once excited was sure to go to the\r\nutmost length, if it had the opportunity. I had purposely been hurrying\r\non to gain a dense copse through which our path lay, and I knew there\r\nwas a snug glade, where we would be in perfect security. It was the\r\ndinner hour of the peasantry, and no one else was likely to come that\r\nway. Just as we entered the copse, she had put her last question. I told\r\nher I would show her, if she would step a few yards beyond the foot\r\npath. She objected, for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would Harry say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion for him to know anything about it, but even if he\r\ndid, has he not himself shown you mamma and me in full enjoyment of her\r\nsweet charms; but, unless you tell him you may be sure I never shall, it\r\nwill not take a minute, and as we have already walked very fast, we have\r\nplenty of time, and our absence will not be observed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith professed reluctance she allowed me to lead her where I wished.\r\nHaving arrived at the favourable spot, I sat down on a gentle slope, and\r\nbegged her to sit down beside me. As you may well suppose, my prick was\r\nrampant, and almost bursting open my trousers, so that as soon as I\r\nunbuttoned, out it flew in all its splendour. She gave a half scream of\r\nsurprise as she gazed upon its large proportions, and declared it looked\r\nlarger than when she had seen it with aunt. Her face flushed, and her\r\neyes sparkled as she gazed, but she seemed half frightened to touch it.\r\nI took her hand and placed it on it. She immediately grasped it\r\nconvulsively, but sighed deeply. I had lain back on the grass that it\r\nmight stand out boldly before her and I told her to try if it was not\r\nthree hands and a head long. She immediately passed one hand over the\r\nother from the root, and said it was really monstrous, and she wondered\r\nhow aunt could have got it into her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling, I hope some day you will find that you can take it all\r\nin with the utmost delight, but I should not think of trying until you\r\nhave had some more practice with Harry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she was handling it with great excitement, and while saying\r\nshe was sure I could never succeed with her, she was evidently longing\r\nto be able to take it in. I saw I must work her up more\xe2\x80\x94so I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Ellen, you know what pleasure it gave you and Harry to play with\r\neach other with your mouths, it is now your turn to let me see your dear\r\nlittle thing\xe2\x80\x94and then you must lie over me reversed, so that we may\r\nenjoy ourselves with tongues and mouths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let me at once pull up her petticoats, but said she feared that even\r\nfor that she was still too sore from Harry\xe2\x80\x99s work last night. I asked if\r\nshe had bathed it in warm water and put glycerine up. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first it smarted, but before going to church, she had done it three\r\ntimes, and no longer felt any pain, but still was afraid of my finger\r\ngoing up. I was introducing it at the moment. It passed in its full\r\nlength without hurting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, pull up your petticoats well, and lie down on me, while I do the\r\nsame with this charming little cunt; my tongue can only give it the\r\nutmost pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe herself was now so much excited that she was ready enough to comply\r\nwith my desires. She got upon me, her petticoats well canted over her\r\nback. She glued her lips to my prick, and sucked and frigged it with an\r\nenergy that proved how highly her passions were fired. Her cunt was\r\nalready in a foam of spendings, which I first licked up. Then sucking\r\nher tiny clitoris, stiffly projecting slightly out, I thrust my middle\r\nfinger up her cunt, and by the wriggling of her backside, saw how much\r\nshe enjoyed it. Introducing a second finger to moisten it, I withdrew\r\nboth, and, turning my hand sideways, made each finger enter a separate\r\naperture. She was already nearly in the grand crisis; it came upon her\r\nbefore I was ready. She poured a greater discharge into my mouth than I\r\nthought the young thing could have spent. It took her breath away, and\r\nshe released her suction of my prick for a minute. But on my begging her\r\nto continue sucking, she did so with increased energy, and I poured out\r\na torrent of sperm that shot down her throat and nearly choked her, but\r\nthe dear girl never let go for all that, and sucked away until not only\r\nwas there not a drop left, but by her delicious titillations she had\r\nbrought my prick up to its utmost vigour again. I, too, had reawakened\r\nher passions. She wanted to renew the sport in this way again, but I\r\nbegged her to allow me to rub the head of my prick up and down between\r\nthe well-moistened lips of her cunt, and then to spend with the point,\r\nor at most the head, within it. She asked if she could trust me to stop\r\nif it hurt her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing shall be done, or rather\r\neverything shall cease the moment you tell me to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf afraid, yet wishing to try, she changed her position to a kneeling\r\none. I canted her petticoats well over her back, and first kissing and\r\nhandling her hard and plump buttocks, which promised a future\r\nperfection, I stooped and again licked her charming pouting cunt with\r\nall its budding fair young curls. Then applying my surcharged mouthful\r\nof saliva to my already well-moistened prick, I lubricated it completely\r\nfrom point to root, and then applied it to the half-opened lips. Rubbing\r\nit up and down here, and over the clitoris, I excited her to the\r\ngreatest pitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Charlie dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9ctry if its head will go in now, and I\r\nwill try to bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was only too glad of the permission, and very rapidly got it in over\r\nthe nut, but it was very tight. I drew it half out again, and then, on\r\nrepeating this five or six times, found I was imperceptibly gaining\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear Charles, it is delicious! Try on, gently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so, and had got rather more than half way in when she went off in\r\nan agony of delight, deliciously pouring her warm liquid over my\r\nenchanted prick, giving, at the same time, such a push backwards, which,\r\nmeeting a firm, though gentle forward movement on my part, joined with\r\nthe natural relaxation following her discharge, drove me up to the hilt\r\nin the very tightest little cunt it has ever been my good fortune to\r\nsheath myself in. I seemed to fill every cranny, and to have stretched\r\nevery part to its utmost distention. My aunt with her great cunt had a\r\npower of pressure that seemed almost to nip off your prick, Miss\r\nFrankland, too, was great in that way. But this was more like a very\r\nwell made first-rate kid glove, two sizes too small for your fingers,\r\nyet giving way without bursting, and fitting every irregularity of the\r\nnail or finger; just so her little cunt fitted my prick exactly like a\r\nglove, and it was truly most ecstatic. A gentle withdrawing, and then as\r\ngentle resheathing, so excited me that I shot a torrent of sperm up into\r\nher very womb. She gave quite a cry of ecstasy, and I could feel the\r\ntight sheath exercising a running movement along the whole length of my\r\nprick, and still more tightly closing all round it\xe2\x80\x94if that were\r\npossible. It was so exquisitely delicious that both of us were almost\r\ninstantly in readiness for another course.\r\n\r\nShe asked if I was all in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my dear, do you think you could have taken any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it appears to fill me to bursting, and to be up to my very\r\nheart. I could not have supported more, but could hardly believe I had\r\nit all, as I did not think it possible, and was afraid there was more to\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid it give you any pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; and does so still\xe2\x80\x94push on, dear Charlie, and don\xe2\x80\x99t spare me,\r\nit is heavenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wriggled and heaved her backside. I seized her by each hip and\r\nfavoured her side movements by, as it were, drawing her off and on;\r\nfaster and faster we moved, until at last the crisis seized us both\r\ntogether. Her head sank with a deep sigh, or rather cry of ecstasy. She\r\nwould have fallen forward on her belly, but that my grip of her hips\r\nheld her bottom close up to my belly, with my prick thrust into the\r\ninnermost end of her cunt, until I felt the three points of the opening\r\nof her womb, like the nailless ends of three fingers grasping, as it\r\nwere, the very point of my prick, and opening themselves to receive the\r\nwhole discharge of my sperm within its innermost recesses. Nothing could\r\nbe more delicious, and as I held her fast, I was myself in a state of\r\nperfect ecstasy. At last addressing some endearing expressions, and\r\ngetting no reply, I found that the dear girl had quite fainted away, and\r\nwas insensible in every respect except in the continued convulsive\r\nthrobs of her delicious tight cunt. However, finding that she did not\r\nrecover her senses, I gently withdrew my still stiff prick. Very little\r\nsperm followed the withdrawal. I wiped her cunt dry with my\r\nhandkerchief, and was glad to see there was no blood stains. I laid her\r\ngently down on her back, ran to a little stream, and taking two handfuls\r\nof water, came back, threw some on the still throbbing cunt, and\r\nsprinkled her face with the drops that still adhered to my palms. This\r\nhad the desired effect; she opened her eyes, raised herself on her\r\nbottom, and threw her arms round my neck as I knelt by her side. Telling\r\nme I had made her taste of the joys of heaven, she kissed me, and then\r\nburst into a hysterical flood of tears. I comforted her as best I could\r\nand asked why she wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, dear Charles, but the last time made me feel both sick\r\nand faint just after you had given me such ecstasy as I never dreamt was\r\npossible. I believe I then fainted, and even now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why but I\r\nfeel quite hysterical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kissed her tenderly, begged her to rise and come to the spring, where\r\nshe could drink and said if she sat down on her feet I would bathe and\r\ncool her dear little cunt, which would probably put all to rights. She\r\ndid so, and was quickly quite restored to herself again. She said she\r\nsupposed it was my enormous size.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it did not hurt me, dear Charles, it only gave me too much\r\npleasure; but you will do it to me another time whenever we have any\r\nopportunity, will you not, dear Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured her I should always be too glad to do so, but that we must\r\nneither let her aunt nor Harry know of our proceedings. This being\r\narranged, and she having quite recovered from the pallor her fainting\r\nfit had caused, we resumed our course homeward, and so hurried on that\r\nHarry, who had come to meet us found us getting over the stile of the\r\nlast field, and was even disappointed that we had got so far, for we\r\nwere now in sight of the cottage. He had hoped to find us much further\r\nback, and that I might have favoured his having a go at his cousin\r\nbefore reaching home. Ellen squeezed my arm. I said it was just as well\r\nas it was, for any imprudence might have awakened his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions, and prevented a night of pleasure, which would be far better\r\nthan any uncomfortable field affair.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at home, mamma thought that Ellen looked fatigued, and\r\nadvised her to go and lie down on her bed, and take an hour\xe2\x80\x99s siesta.\r\nShe told us boys we had better do the same, as she had some private\r\nmatters to attend to. Harry and I saw immediately what was meant, and we\r\nbetook ourselves to our respective rooms, I to expect mamma, who did not\r\nfail to come, and Harry to watch her, and then made the most of the\r\nopportunity with his cousin. I quickly undressed, and when mamma came I\r\nfound she had divested herself of stays and undergarments; so when she\r\nundid her gown, and let fall her shift, she stood in all the naked glory\r\nof her beautiful form. I flew to embrace her most lovingly. Both our\r\nhands wandered and being both in full heat, we were at it in a moment\r\nfast and furious. I drove on, admirably seconded by dear mamma, and we\r\nquickly both gave down at the same instant a most delicious libation on\r\nthe altar of Venus, and then died away in all the after-enjoyment. We\r\nlay for nearly a quarter of an hour soaking in the delicious bliss of\r\nsatisfied desire. Mamma, on coming to her senses, kissed me most\r\ntenderly, and declared she had never believed it possible that she could\r\nhave had such exquisite delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, my dear Charles, I never dreamt that any man, let alone a boy\r\nlike you, could be so magnificently hung. Oh, it is also such joy to me\r\nto think I have first taught you the real joys of coition, and tasted\r\nthe first sweets of that most glorious weapon. My dear Charlie, I must\r\ncontemplate its beauties in this full light; withdraw the dear fellow\r\nand turn on your back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so. She rose, and turning in the reverse position, brought her\r\nlovely foaming cunt right down on my mouth. I sucked up all the\r\ndelicious foam oozing from the aperture. Then drawing into my mouth her\r\nhalf-stiffened clitoris, which was then pendant like a little boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncock, I soon sucked it into its utmost rigidity, frigging her rich\r\npouting cunt with two fingers, the while. She, on her part, was not\r\nidle, first playing with my prick, covering and uncovering its head,\r\nwhich soon made it stand up in all of its glory. She was profuse and\r\nloud in its praises. Then getting too excited for mere admiration, she\r\ntook it in her mouth and sucked it, and manipulated it with one hand,\r\nfingering my codpiece with the other. I then found her fingers were\r\nfeeling and tickling my bottom-hole. She took her mouth from off my\r\nprick, and paused a moment; then again applied her finger to my\r\nfundament, and made it gently penetrate as far as it would go. The\r\nprevious pause had evidently been for the purpose of moistening her\r\nfinger with her saliva that it might slip in easily. I was delighted to\r\nfind that she had come to this, but pretending ignorance, I stopped my\r\nproceedings to ask her what she was doing to my bottom, which could give\r\nme such exquisite delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my finger, my dear Charles, my late husband was always delighted\r\nwith my doing this, and used also to add greatly to my pleasure by doing\r\nthe same to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I do so to you, dear mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my darling boy; moisten your finger first and then do it in my\r\nbottom-hole, as you have been doing it in my cunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I can do both at the same time, they are so close\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a delightful darling; do so, and it will be double pleasure to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I immediately commenced to postillion her to her and my extreme\r\ngratification. We soon spent with the utmost delight, and both swallowed\r\nall we could get, continuing our suctions until the passions of both\r\nwere again excited. I now declared I must fuck her again in the kneeling\r\nposition, in which she had before given me such exquisite pleasure. As\r\nshe drew a little higher up, I flung my arms round her fine backside,\r\nand glued my lips to her bottom-hole, and thrust my tongue in and out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Charles, dear, what are you doing? Oh! how delightful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she wriggled her backside over my mouth in a most voluptuous and\r\nlascivious way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rise my darling, and fuck me; you have made me so very lewd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI drew myself up on my knees behind her, and was into her with wild\r\nferocity that made her cry out with joy as she felt the mighty\r\ninstrument rush within her. I stooped and frigged her clitoris at her\r\ndesire, but wishing to contemplate the glorious movement of her backside\r\nI begged her to frig herself that I might be able to do so. Seizing hold\r\nof her hips, I drew her splendid bottom off and on my stiff and glowing\r\nprick with such immense delight to her that she went off and spent\r\nprofusely, the hot stream bathing my delighted prick. But having already\r\nfucked Ellen so shortly before, and having spent twice at the present\r\ntime, I remained for a while quiet, with mamma\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite cunt\r\ndeliriously throbbing round it to the infinite enjoyment of my cock. I\r\nstooped and nibbled with my fingers at one of her nipples. I played with\r\nand frigged her very fine clitoris, which was soon in stiff-standing\r\nexcitement again. Being cool myself, I soon worked her up into the\r\nwildest state of excitement by my frigging and the throbbings of my\r\nprick, aided with occasional long slowly drawn-out movements, and then\r\nas slowly regaining ground until within the last three inches, when it\r\nwas thrust vigorously forward, and kept there for her convulsive\r\npressures on it. I kept this up until she was almost wild with lust, and\r\ncried out for more vigorous movements. I did not immediately comply, but\r\ncontinued my exciting proceedings until she bit the pillow in the\r\nmadness of her lust. Then I drove on fast and furious, amid cries of\r\ndelight and ecstasy on her part, until the grand crisis overtook us both\r\nat the same instant in a perfect fury and agony of delight. I had\r\npreviously left the frigging to herself, and had seized her hips and\r\nenjoyed the glorious sight of the furious contortions of her bottom\r\nunder the excessive lubricity of her wildly excited lasciviousness. She\r\ndied away in such excess of ecstasy that she would have fallen on her\r\nbelly but for the grip I had upon her hips, and the pressure with which\r\nI drew back her glorious bottom against my belly. I threw back my head\r\nin the agony of delight, and brayed like a donkey as I had done once\r\nbefore when fucking the luscious Frankland, and felt the three pointed\r\nentrance to her womb close upon and nibble at the point of my prick so\r\ndelightfully, just as dear Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s had done in the wood. As I came to my\r\nsenses I spoke to dear mamma, and found that she too had fainted away,\r\nand was quite insensible to everything but the convulsive inner\r\nmovements of her delicious cunt. I withdrew and laid her gently down on\r\nher side, bringing a tumbler of water, a sponge, and towel, I opened her\r\nsplendid thighs, sponged and bathed her cunt, which showed but little of\r\nthe torrent of sperm I had just poured into it. I then sprinkled her\r\nface, and she came to with a deep sigh. Her first utterance was to bless\r\nme for the joy I had given her, which was in fact too much, and then she\r\nburst into tears and became quite hysterical. I thought it odd that I\r\nshould have produced the same effect upon her more accustomed and more\r\ndeveloped organs as I had done on dear Ellen. I comforted her in my\r\nboyish way, and asked how it was that the effect should have been\r\ndifferent from anything she had previously experienced with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a deep sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have caused me such\r\nextreme sensations that I fear you must have got me with child, you\r\nseemed to penetrate my very womb, and to excite me far beyond anything I\r\never previously remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy loved mamma, can I possibly get a child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a child, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, a dozen, with such a great\r\nmonster of a cock, that so excites us poor women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI embraced her most tenderly, and said I was so happy to think I should\r\nbe the father of a child of hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! my dear boy, it may be joy to you, but what a sorrow it will be\r\nto me if such should be the case; think how I should lose position in\r\nthe world if it should be known, and even if by going abroad I could\r\nhide my shame from the public, still what shifts and contrivances I\r\nshould be put to to ensure secrecy; but never mind, my darling, I would\r\nrun twice such risk to enjoy your person, and secure your affection; you\r\nmust ever cherish and love me, my Charlie, for I risk good name and fame\r\nfor you; but now I must be gone, or we shall be sought for; try and\r\nsleep a little, my dear boy, for I am sure you need it after your\r\nexertions, and remember you must gain strength to renew them this\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kissed me lovingly, rose, put on her things and left me to repose.\r\nBut I could not help thinking of what she had said about fearing that\r\nthat peculiar fuck in which she had fainted portended fructification. If\r\nso, I thought dear Ellen will probably be in the same predicament, for\r\nthe result was precisely the same with her. I may here observe that\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x99s fears became certainties, both in her case and Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nEventually they both left the country together, when staying would have\r\nbrought on discovery. And, curiously enough, they were both delivered of\r\ndaughters on the same day. Of both I was the happy father, although\r\nHarry had the credit of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s child, but she herself always asserted\r\nto me that it was the delicious fuck in the wood that did the mischief.\r\nAnd from the peculiar effect produced on both mothers on that day, I\r\nnever had any doubt of the real paternity, besides, the child grew up my\r\nvery image. Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was superbly developed when she became a\r\nyoung woman. She had even a larger clitoris than Miss Frankland, with\r\nwhich she absolutely deflowered her sister\xe2\x80\x99s cousin at the age of\r\nfourteen. I may also incidentally observe that at the age of fifteen I\r\nhad both their maidenheads, as far as the male sex was concerned. And\r\nHarry and I often fucked them together in every way; and my darling\r\ndaughter with her long and large clitoris has often fucked my bottom,\r\nwhile I was doing the same to her sister, with Harry below fucking her\r\nwhom he believed to be his daughter. But this belongs to my latter\r\nexperiences, and has nothing to do with the present period of my life,\r\nthough, perhaps, I may be tempted hereafter to enter into all the\r\ndetails of my middle age and later experiences.\r\n\r\nDear reader, pardon me this digression. To resume, I slept soundly for\r\nan hour, then rose, and strolled in the garden with Harry, who related\r\nto me how he had taken advantage of mamma\xe2\x80\x99s occupation to steal into\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s room. She had been much afraid, the sly pussey, to allow him to\r\nenter again, but when once he got within, and she found it did not hurt\r\nher, but the contrary, she got extremely lewd, and they had two splendid\r\nfucks. Then stealing along to my door to peep as to how we were getting\r\non, we so excited them again that he had another from behind, while she\r\nstooped and peeped all the time, for it was when I was fucking mamma\r\nfrom behind, on my knees, and they concluded it would be our last for\r\nthe present. When they had brought matters to a finish they separated,\r\nand mamma had found Ellen fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, by Jove, Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9chow splendid mother fucks, I quite\r\nenvied you, and I shall never rest until I get into her myself; how\r\ngloriously she wriggles her backside, and how lusciously she enjoys\r\nfucking; to be sure such a mighty prick as yours is enough to stir up\r\nevery passion; it astonished, and I think made Ellen more lewd, although\r\nshe is sure she could never take in such a monster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI smiled at thinking how easily the very youngest of the fair sex\r\ndeceives us, but I took care not to let Harry know my opinion.\r\n\r\nWe re-entered for dinner, and spent a pleasant evening, which was the\r\nforerunner to the delights of the night. Mamma came as soon as she\r\nthought Ellen fast asleep, which Ellen took very good care should soon\r\nbe the case. In a moment, she was quite naked, and clasped to my equally\r\nnaked body. I had been expecting her, and thinking over the delights of\r\nour last fuck, so that I was rampant before her arrival. She was equally\r\neager for the fray, and at it we went hammer and tongs, and soon brought\r\nthe first bout to a close, in mutual \xe2\x80\x9cah\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coh\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d of delight. We\r\nsoaked for some time in the delicious enjoyment. Then mamma scolded both\r\nherself and me for our precipitation, saying that we threw away all the\r\nluxury and abandon of fucking when we went at it in such haste; it was\r\nin that way mere animal instinct, and wanted all the lascivious delight\r\nof lubricity and skill in fucking. She said, now that the edge was taken\r\noff our appetites, we must begin again with a mutual gamahuche. She rose\r\nfirst to piddle, and allowed me to see the rush of water from her\r\ndelicious cunt. Then lighting two more candles, she placed two at the\r\nfoot of the bed, and two at the head, by which we should both have the\r\nadvantage of seeing all we were caressing. Then I lay down on my back,\r\nand she mounted on me, in reverse, thus bringing her bottom down over my\r\nface. I thrust my tongue up her cunt, and licked up the delicious spunk\r\noozing down from the inside. Her piddle had washed all away from the\r\npouting lips. Then taking her charming clitoris in my mouth, I sucked it\r\nup to its greatest stiffness. I had thrust three fingers into her cunt,\r\nand when I found she had thrust hers into my bottom, I transferred them\r\nall into her beautiful pink bum-hole. They were very greasy from my\r\nsperm coming down upon them when in her cunt, and as she favoured their\r\nentrance by pushing out her bottom, all three slipped in, without,\r\napparently, her thinking it was more than one. I was delighted to see\r\nhow easily it stretched out, for this gave me great ground to hope that\r\nI should be able to manage to get my large pego within, which I was\r\nfully resolved upon doing, but it required a little artfulness to do so\r\nwithout raising her suspicions that it was no new road to me. She\r\nbrought matters to a conclusion much as before, and when re-excited,\r\nmamma proposed to teach me a new way, which was by her mounting on me,\r\nand staking herself on my standing pego. Like others before her, she did\r\nnot stoop down upon me until she had made herself spend where she was,\r\nwhile I saved myself for further fucking.\r\n\r\nWhen she died off, she sank on my bosom. I clasped her waist with one\r\narm, sucked the bubby nearest my mouth, and reaching round my other arm,\r\nI brought my hand over her bottom to the delightful orifice, first\r\nmoistening my finger with her spending which was oozing out between the\r\nlips of her cunt and my standing prick. I thrust my finger into her\r\nbottom-hole, and worked it in and out, to her infinite satisfaction. She\r\ncried out in the excess of her lewdness\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear boy, that is just as my dear husband used to do, and it\r\ngave me great pleasure, but not near so much as you do, for your dear\r\nprick is twice as large as his was, and fills me with an excess of\r\npleasure which was never approached with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this led up to a superb and lascivious fuck, in which we both died\r\naway in mutual ecstasy, with cries of voluptuousness, and then lay\r\nsoaking in delight until her weight forced me to beg her to turn on her\r\nside. We then had a long sweet chat of love. Turning the talk on her\r\nsuspicions of having got with child at the morning prayers, I remarked\r\nthat she had had only one child by her husband, and as he had lived many\r\nyears after Harry\xe2\x80\x99s birth, and from what she said, she had continued to\r\nbe enjoyed by him, it was, therefore, not probable she would now be got\r\nin the family-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat appears probable, my dear boy, but then he took precaution not to\r\nget any more children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what precautions could he take, and how did he do so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a curious boy, but I shall tell you. He used to continue long\r\nat it, making me spend two or three times before he did, and then when\r\nhe felt it coming he used to withdraw, and his prick being all moist, he\r\nwould slip it into my bottom, and spend there as soon as ever he got the\r\nhead of it inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did that give you any pleasure, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had excited me, and made me spend several times before he did so;\r\nand beyond slight irritation I did not feel much pleasure, as he was\r\ngenerally so near the crisis that he could scarce do more than get its\r\nhead in when off he went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ever get it in altogether\xe2\x80\x94and then did it give you pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes he did when he had drawn it out of my cunt too soon; in such\r\ncases he used to pause until by rubbing my clitoris he got me into a\r\nrenewed state of lewdness, and then the pleasure was peculiar and\r\ngreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear, mamma, you must let me too fuck you in that way, and then\r\nyou know we shall get no children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling Charlie, it is impossible that this great big thing could\r\never get into that orifice, my late husband\xe2\x80\x99s was not half your size,\r\nand he had great difficulty unless I had already spent three or four\r\ntimes and relaxed all those parts. I should not dare to let you attempt\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes my darling mamma, you will let me just get its point in and\r\nspend there. I should so like to try. We will fuck two or three times\r\nfirst, and then after the third time I shall frig you till you spend\r\nfirst, and so I shall be ready just to put in the point for you to try\r\nhow it feels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear boy, the least throb on my part will push it out, unless\r\nit is in over the nut, and only look what a size it is. I can hardly\r\ngrasp it, and although it is so velvety it is quite hard. Oh, the dear\r\nfellow, let me kiss it, and then do you fuck me again, my darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent her body, gave me a delicious suck, then throwing herself on\r\nher back, and opening her beautiful thighs, invited me to mount her.\r\nBefore doing so I also bent and sucked her charming and well-developed\r\nclitoris, until she squealed again with pleasure, and begged me to put\r\nit to her. I threw myself on her belly, and with one vigorous shove\r\ndrove my rampant prick up to the hilt, making her all shake again. She\r\nwas so hotly wound up that she spent with the single shove, and poured a\r\nflood of hot liquid over my delighted prick. I, too, would have gone off\r\nin two more thrusts had she not thrown her arms and legs around me, and\r\nslipping her hands over my buttocks, held me tight pressed against the\r\npouting and greedy lips of her salacious cunt as if she would shove in\r\nballocks, buttocks and all, if it were possible. So keeping it tightly\r\nthrust in up to the lowest hair, which lay all crushed between us, I let\r\nher indulge in all the delight of perfect conjunction, responding to her\r\ndelicious throbbing cunt with powerful throbs of my own highly excited\r\nprick. For more than a quarter of an hour did she lie panting and\r\nconvulsively sobbing in the perfect ecstasy of enjoyment. At last she\r\ndrew my mouth down to hers, and thrust her sweet tongue into my mouth; I\r\nsucked it, and her hands relaxing the pressure of my buttocks, against\r\nher cunt, I began a slow in and out movement that soon renewed her\r\nutmost lubricity. Most actively and divinely did she second me with an\r\nart quite her own. Fast and furious grew our movements, until, like all\r\nthings human, they came to an end in a death-like agony of delight, in\r\nwhich my very soul seemed to take flight, and we lay all unconscious,\r\nfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long, enjoying all those exquisite after-delights\r\nwhich a prick soaking in the cunt of a beautiful and lewd woman so\r\nenchantingly confers. When we recovered, we rolled over sideways, and\r\nstill intertwined and conjoined in the sweet priapic bonds, we lay\r\nbilling and cooing with all those soft loving murmurings and bitings so\r\nbefitting such moments. At last both were again ready, and longing for\r\nthe fight. I proposed the delicious kneeling position. She saw at once\r\nmy object, and said I was a little traitor, who wanted to surprise her\r\nbottom-hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my darling boy, it is really impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI embraced, flattered, cajoled, and implored her until at last she\r\npromised that if I would engage on honour not to go further, she would\r\ntry and support the entrance of my prick as far as over the nut, but\r\nthat I must really withdraw it if it was too painful for her. So these\r\npreliminaries being arranged, she got into position. First stooping to\r\nlick out her delicious cunt, and give a suck or two at her charming\r\nclitoris, I brought my eager prick to the pouting and longing lips of\r\nher delicious cunt, and after two or three rubs, thrust it in with a\r\nrush that made my belly smack against her glorious backside. We then lay\r\nquiet, throbbing mutually in the luxury of voluptuousness. I passed a\r\nhand under her belly, and frigging her clitoris quickly, made her come\r\nin an ecstasy of delight. I only gave her time for one or two throbs of\r\nmy prick, and knowing that nothing so much delights a lecherous woman as\r\nquick movements almost immediately after spending, I commenced rapid\r\nseries of thrusts, shoving my prick well up to the hilt every time, and\r\ntalking grossly all the while, such as\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not that shove make you quiver? There you have it to the ballocks\r\nin your lascivious and delicious cunt,\xe2\x80\x9d &amp;c.\r\n\r\nShe grew madly lewd, called me her own dear delightful fucker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; I feel it is up to the root. I have it well in, my dear boy.\r\nYour dear, great big prick, it kills me\xe2\x80\x94kills\xe2\x80\x94kills me\xe2\x80\x94with\xe2\x80\x94joy. Oh! oh!\r\noh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe squealed again with all the lewdness of the most delicious spend.\r\nShe had hardly gone off, and was yet in all the throes of delight when\r\nI, too, feeling I could hold out no longer, suddenly withdrew the\r\nreeking shaft, and bringing it to bear against the corrugated and\r\nbeautiful orifice of her bottom, attempted to introduce it.\r\nNotwithstanding the fury of my excitement, I was sufficiently gentle to\r\npush in without force, and sheathed it over the nut without difficulty\r\nor drawing a murmur from dear mamma, who fulfilled her promise, and did\r\nher utmost to help me by pushing out her big bum, and offering no\r\nresistance with her sphincter muscles. I was so highly wound up that\r\neven if I had promised to be content with the insertion of the head, I\r\ncould not have gone on further, as the access seized me with such\r\nkilling sweetness that I melted away, shooting a torrent of sperm far up\r\ninto her entrails, and then losing all power of even the slightest\r\nfurther thrusts. I suppose it was the long holding back to let mamma\r\nspend two or three times that had wrought me up to such a high pitch of\r\nnervous excitement that when I spent I seemed to lose all power of\r\nfurther advance. This was the first time I ever felt this momentary\r\nimpuissance, but it was by no means the last; it generally follows the\r\nholding back your spending powers in the fuck that leads to it. The\r\ndelicious throbbings of dear mamma\xe2\x80\x99s luscious cunt, which were repeated\r\nin her arms, soon reawakened my momentarily dormant powers. My prick had\r\ngone down more than usual, so that it was only a soft half stiffness\r\nthat ensued, but enough to enable me to give it a forward movement, and\r\nit slipped almost imperceptibly in quite as far as he could go before\r\ndear mamma had recovered from the ecstasy of her last discharge. As she\r\ncame to, I continued convulsively catching my breath, as if I were still\r\nin that exquisite sensation of half consciousness. I felt her pass her\r\nhand between her thighs, and heard her murmur\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I declare he is up to the hilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer gentle touch on my cods, which she took in her hand and fondly\r\ncaressed, made my prick stiffen sensibly. She felt this, and caressed\r\nthem more until she made it stand as stiff as ever, still imbedded to\r\nthe utmost in that delicious bottom, which by its increased throbbings,\r\nseemed rather to welcome the stranger than repulse him. I pretended now\r\nto recover my full consciousness, and cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, where am I? I have never known such heavenly joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her face up from the pillow\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you naughty boy, you have actually gone in up to the hilt; ah, you\r\nhave broken your promise; but I forgive you, only don\xe2\x80\x99t move yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured her I did not know how it got there, as I had spent and lost\r\nconsciousness as soon as ever his head was within.\r\n\r\nHere I throbbed, and was met by as delicious a pressure. I passed my\r\nhand round her belly, and found her clitoris stiff and excited. I rubbed\r\nwith the fingers of the other hand at one of her hard projecting\r\nnipples. She soon grew madly lewd, and began a side wriggle on my\r\nrampant prick. I lay still, determined to let her passions demand\r\nmovement of my part. I had not to wait long. She begged me to try a\r\ngentle movement, I obeyed, and slowly withdrew but a short way, and as\r\nslowly returned. Soon her lubricity got beyond all bounds. She begged me\r\nto draw out further and somewhat quicker\xe2\x80\x94then quicker and quicker, until\r\nwe both were in an excess of furious lust, which knew no bounds. We\r\nrushed on to the final crisis with mutual cries of agonised delight;\r\nindeed, mamma squealed so loud that I afterwards thought she must have\r\nbeen heard. Her pleasure was of the wildest, and when I poured a flood\r\nof sperm up her entrails at the very moment she herself was spending, we\r\nboth fell forward and fainted away. I was too much lost in ecstatic joy\r\nmyself to observe this, but lay long a tightly held prisoner engulphed\r\nin that most exquisite joy-giving aperture. At last I became aware that\r\nmamma had really fainted. So drawing my prick out with somewhat of a\r\ngood pull, for he was most tightly held, and came out with a flop, I\r\nrose and brought some water to mamma. I sprinkled her face, and she\r\nopened her eyes, which beamed the intensest love upon me. Her lips\r\nmurmured something, I put the tumbler to her mouth, she drank with\r\navidity. Then looking at me again with the most loving expression, she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling boy, you will kill me with delight. Never\xe2\x80\x94oh, never\xe2\x80\x94have I\r\nknown such joy. It was too much for me, and I fear I am also injuring\r\nyou. We must be more moderate in future. Help me up, for I must rise.\r\nYour last coup requires me to absent myself for a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, threw her robe over her shoulders, and left the room to go to\r\nthe water closet. I hoped that she would not go into her own room and\r\ndiscover how matters were going on there. Fortunately she was afraid of\r\nawakening Ellen, and so prevent our continuing bedfellows for the rest\r\nof the night. She returned. I had purified myself in the meantime, and\r\nnow acted as her _femme de chambre_, and laved all the parts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, we must not do this again for some time, do you know I\r\nhave passed blood, and was very sore when relieving myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe got again into bed. She would not allow of any further fuckings, but\r\ntenderly embracing me, and putting my head on her bosom, we soon fell\r\nasleep. She awoke me at dawn with kissing me and feeling my\r\nstiff-standing pego. She laid herself on her back, and we had two most\r\ndelicious fucks without withdrawing. I knew that if I did withdraw she\r\nwould take herself off. Nevertheless, she took most kindly to the\r\nsecond, as it would be our last until we had another opportunity of\r\nmeeting. She exerted all her wonderful skill and her movements were of\r\nastounding agility. She twined herself round me almost serpent-like. Our\r\nmouths and tongues were equally engaged, and the final crisis was beyond\r\ndescription exquisite. I tried hard for a third course, but we had\r\nalready prolonged our sports to so dangerous an hour, for we could hear\r\nthem opening the lower window shutters, that she gave me a sweet kiss of\r\nthanks and tore herself away. I lay thinking over the joys of that\r\necstatic night, and then rose and dressed quickly, as we were to\r\nbreakfast and then walk home, where we were expected at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nHowever, after breakfast, mamma drew me into her sanctum, a house\r\nstoreroom, to give me some directions. Of course, no sooner was she\r\nthere, than pushing her towards the table, I canted up her petticoats\r\nover back, and gave her a good fuck, getting in from behind. She yielded\r\nwith a good grace, notwithstanding her protestations that it was not for\r\nthat she had come, as if it had been for anything else! Oh! woman,\r\nwoman! how thou seekest to deceive, even when gaining the very object\r\nthou hast in view.\r\n\r\nHarry told me they had peeped in and seen what we were at but he was not\r\nso ready as me, and had not been able to go and do likewise.\r\n\r\nWe loitered all too long, and did not get back to school until after ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. The doctor sternly ordered us to attend him in his sanctum at\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. We knew what that meant\xe2\x80\x94a good flogging, and then the\r\ndoctor enjoying the account of our successes. At twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock we\r\nentered the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s room, who followed us immediately after. He scolded\r\nus sternly for being late, and said he meant to flog us both well for\r\nour idleness and, he had no doubt, debauchery. We knew immediately that\r\nhe meant to lay on. From time to time he was fond of really seriously\r\nflogging someone and we now saw that such was his present intention,\r\nalthough we also knew it would end in an orgie, after we had excited him\r\nsufficiently by recounting the details of the fucking which he no doubt\r\nfelt certain had taken place. He made us all strip, and choosing to take\r\nHarry first he made me the horse to flog him on. When all was ready, he\r\nbegan by some real sharp cuts on Harry\xe2\x80\x99s backside, and then commenced\r\nhis remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, young gentleman, you have been seducing your cousin, have\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand then making that the excuse for neglecting\r\nyour school.\xe2\x80\x9d Whack, whack, whack. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had formerly whipped out\r\nall idea about fucking your cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d Whack, whack, whack.\r\n\r\nPoor Harry writhed in real pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it again without your leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy leave indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d Whack, whack, whack.\r\n\r\nThe doctor now laid on for some time most unmercifully until the\r\nrevolution of pain turned to lubricity, and Harry\xe2\x80\x99s cock began to stand,\r\nrapping fiercely at my bottom as he writhed under the sharp infliction\r\nof the rod. Upon seeing the expected effect, the doctor relaxed his\r\nseverity, and changing the rod to his other hand, afterwards only\r\ntickled the bottom to keep up the excitement. Taking hold of the\r\nstanding prick, he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is the article that has been doing all the mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe frigged it a little, stooped and gave it a suck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, I find it still tastes of cunt, and smells the true odour of\r\nit; so you have been at it this morning again. Let me hear how it\r\nhappened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Harry was let go. The doctor seated himself, Harry stood before\r\nhim, while the doctor in delight, handled his stiff-standing pego.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, let me hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, when Charlie occupied mamma\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is it, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall have all that out\r\nof him, by and by, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slipped into Ellen. She made some difficulty for fear mamma should\r\ncatch us; but I took her and showed her through the key hole, how she\r\nwas having Charlie into her. Ellen was astonished at Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s immense\r\nsize, and seeing how easily and delightedly mamma accommodated him, she\r\nthought that my smaller size could not hurt her, and she let me do it.\r\nBut I made her scream and bleed when I got in far enough to reach her\r\nmaidenhead. She tried to shake me off, but I was too firmly seated for\r\nthat, and I fucked her then, and again before I withdrew. I laved her\r\ncunt and applied some glycerine, and this morning did it again without\r\nhurting her any more. And she liked it so much that afterwards she would\r\nkiss and suck it, and made me spend in her mouth, and then got me up\r\nagain for a final go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour, a very pretty affair,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cNow suck my\r\nprick, as she sucked yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Harry did, till the doctor was rampant. He then made him cease, but\r\nordered me to mount on Harry\xe2\x80\x99s back. I knew I should catch it sharp, as\r\nthe doctor was just excited enough to wish to be more so. And preciously\r\nhe gave it me\xe2\x80\x94interpolating questions as to how I had accomplished my\r\nwicked ends. I told him it was his own advice to me to let her see my\r\nprick, which I did, and the bait took. Whack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you act this innocent sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! do spare me, sir, and don\xe2\x80\x99t lay on so hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare you, indeed! and how did she fuck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, most splendidly, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often did you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know, sir; we were at it all night, and again this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she suck your prick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhack\xe2\x80\x94whack\xe2\x80\x94whack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said it was the finest she had ever seen, and that I must keep it\r\nfor her only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that will do, now suck my prick, as she did yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was soon excited up to the top of his bent. He made Harry take the\r\nrod, and belabour his backside, and I had to stoop over the table, while\r\nhe fucked and frigged me, repeating all the time the account we had\r\ngiven him of our fucking. After he spent, he dismissed us, having gained\r\nhis object. Shortly before our Christmas holidays commenced, dear Mrs.\r\nDale informed me, while sleeping with her one Saturday night, that she\r\nfound from the stoppage of certain things, she was in the family-way by\r\nthis sad rogue of a fellow, taking my large though at the moment soft\r\nand inert instrument into her caressing hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling mamma, is it so indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy prick rose to bursting point at the very idea, and in an instant I\r\nwas on her, and we ran a most delicious course, in which both died away\r\nin rapturous insensibility. Being thus cooled, mamma began to discuss\r\nthe probabilities, and what ought to be done, if it should turn out as\r\nshe feared. She explained to me that as yet she could not speak with\r\ncertainty, but remembering the fainting on the first night, and the\r\ncessation of her monthlies, the nature of which she explained to me,\r\nlittle dreaming that I was perfectly _au fait_ of the whole matter, she\r\nhad every reason to dread that her fears where too well founded. This\r\nwould make it necessary for her to go abroad, when she would be so far\r\nadvanced as to be likely to draw observation. But she said it would not\r\ndo to distress ourselves about that until we were more certain of the\r\nevent. However, the very idea nerved me to renewed efforts, and again,\r\nand again, we rushed into all the ecstasies of passion in every form and\r\nway, especially did I gamahuche and suck up her precious balm, and in\r\nlike manner she, too, sucked me until exhausted nature laid us both in\r\nthe lap of Morpheus. We renewed our delightful pastimes when morning\r\nlight awoke us after our refreshing slumbers. Several times during the\r\nSunday we adjourned to mamma\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom for the same purpose, and again\r\nhad a glorious night of it before separating on the Monday morning. The\r\nfollowing Sunday, after another Saturday night of bliss, we all went\r\nover to church, which heavy rain had prevented on the previous week, and\r\nafter service went to the rectory for luncheon. Here, in course of\r\nconversation, Mrs. Dale mentioned that business would require her\r\npresence in London for some days, and that she proposed starting on the\r\nfollowing Thursday, which was the day after our breaking up for the\r\nholidays. She said also that she would take her son with her to London.\r\nThe doctor here observed that he, too, must go to London, to see a\r\ngentleman who had some idea of sending his son to the rectory, and if\r\nMrs. Dale could defer the departure until Saturday, it would be very\r\nagreeable to him to be her companion on the journey. This was readily\r\nacceded to, and my dear aunt, who guessed to what this tended, and who\r\nhad herself taken a great fancy to Ellen, and longed to embrace her\r\nyoung charms and gamahuche her, chimed in with a proposal that as the\r\ndear girl would thus be left quite alone, she would be most happy if she\r\nwould accept her invitation to occupy the bedroom that opened out of her\r\nown room during Mrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s absence. The latter, who little dreamt of my\r\nconnection with her dear niece, and thought that the protection of my\r\naunt would be a safeguard to her, jumped at the invitation, and\r\nexpressed her gratification and thanks for so kind a consideration on my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s part. I have not alluded to Harry all this time, but of course,\r\nwhenever his mother and I were occupied in amorous alliance, he was\r\nequally engaged in the same delicious pastime with Ellen. And, I may\r\nadd, that once or twice I had seized a favourable opportunity of\r\ngratifying the little lecherous creature with what she called a feast of\r\nmy noble prick. She, of course, was delighted at my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s proposition\r\nas she at once foresaw how she would have me all to herself for more\r\nthan a week. A single glance from her explained all this; and when, on\r\nleaving, she found an opportunity of taking my hand, her pressure of it\r\nwas most eloquent. So all parties were delighted, for Harry, when we got\r\ntogether alone said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Charlie, I am so jolly glad; I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you\r\nanything I\xe2\x80\x99ll fuck my mother before I come back. You know how I long to\r\nbe in the delicious cunt that bore me; the moment I heard she meant to\r\ntake me with her, my cock stood ready to burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle, too, who also longed to fuck Mrs. Dale, had his intentions in\r\nthat direction favoured by the arrangement concluded. The following\r\nnight, when I was in bed with aunt and him, in the interval of a\r\ncharming little orgie, and after fucking me while I was in aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbottom, and for the moment he could do no more, the conversation turned\r\non the coming journey. He expressed the pleasure he felt at the\r\nopportunity it gave him of indulging in a long desired object. The\r\nlecherous old fellow also alluded to a future opportunity it would give\r\nhim of enjoying the younger charms of the niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you and my dear wife between you will break her in to allow\r\nof any action on my part; and, by the way, my dear, I would suggest that\r\nyou should surprise Charlie in the act, and tear them asunder in\r\npretended rage\xe2\x80\x94that Charlie should seize you, and say he would make you\r\nby force a participator in the act, on the pretence of shutting you up\r\nfor finding fault: you must break from his arms, and fly to your own\r\nbed, he must catch you as you try to enter it, and push his great big\r\ncock into you, on which you must cry for help, and call upon Ellen to\r\ncome to your succour; she will come, but I do not judge her right, if\r\nshe will not rather assist Charlie, by holding you, than otherwise. You\r\nmust afterwards appear much offended; but it may be safely left to the\r\ninfluence of Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s great prick to reconcile you to the incest, then\r\nrelaxing, as if gained over by it, you can join in their sports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus this admirable man, with his great knowledge of the world and sex,\r\ngave us excellent advice, which, as I shall state in the sequel, we\r\nfollowed pretty exactly. Meanwhile aunt, excited by expectation, had\r\ntaken my prick in her mouth, and sucked it into firmness, then mounting\r\nupon me, she began such an exciting action, wriggling her magnificent\r\nbackside, that it fired my uncle anew. Finding his prick stood\r\nsufficiently stiff, he knelt between my legs, and greatly to the\r\nsatisfaction of my darling aunt, gave her the double pleasure of two\r\npricks fucking her at the same time, one before and the other behind.\r\n\r\nMy guardian had desired that I should continue with my uncle during the\r\nholidays, and I was to leave him altogether at the end of the next half.\r\nI did not know his object at the time, but I found that he himself went\r\ndown to my mother, and stayed for a fortnight, paying great attention to\r\nMiss Frankland. He announced his wish that my sisters should go to a\r\nfirst-rate finishing school in London in the summer, and seeing Miss\r\nFrankland look somewhat disappointed, he sought an interview with her,\r\nand laid himself and his fortune at her feet; expressing a wish that if\r\nshe accepted him, their marriage should take place on her separation\r\nfrom her pupils. This was too good an offer to be refused, and after the\r\nusual grimace of being perfectly unprepared for such a proposal, and\r\ndesiring to have a day or two to consider it, she accepted the offer. I\r\nat once anticipated immense gratification from this connection. I should\r\nnaturally, when in London, have every opportunity of enjoying that\r\nadorable creature, and it will be seen in the fourth volume of these\r\nmemoirs, to what delicious orgies this connection led. You may be sure\r\nthat my loved mistress, the adorable Benson, and the no less lascivious\r\nEgerton, would welcome so glorious a creature as Miss Frankland, at that\r\ntime become Mrs. Nixon, and how the Count\xe2\x80\x99s eyes glistened, when he\r\nbeheld her in all the majesty of her superb and hairy form; how the two\r\nwomen gamahuched her splendid clitoris, and how the Count and I strove\r\nwhich should most fully satisfy her lascivious and lustful passions. But\r\nall this will be seen in its proper place in the sequel.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the day arrived for the departure of uncle and Mrs. Dale, with\r\nHarry. As the coach passed through our village, Mrs. Dale drove over\r\nbringing Ellen with her, to leave her at the rectory, as arranged. All\r\nthe proprieties were duly observed. They departed, Harry going outside,\r\nwith only the doctor and Mrs. Dale in the interior, I squeezed my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and gave him a knowing look, which he returned, with a\r\nmeaning wink\xe2\x80\x94and off they went. When we returned to the house, and aunt\r\ntook Ellen up to the room adjoining her own, with which there was a door\r\nof communication, and which, I have before observed, had been made use\r\nof by uncle on more than one occasion. When they came downstairs, with\r\nkind consideration, for she could see by the protrusion in my trousers\r\nthe state I was in, aunt said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I have some household duties to arrange, so you must excuse\r\nme; meanwhile Charlie will show you our grounds, and amuse you for an\r\nhour or two. When luncheon is ready I shall order the large bell to be\r\nrung for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen had not yet removed her bonnet, and taking up her shawl, we\r\nsallied out. You may be sure we lost no time in reaching the summer\r\nhouse, already known to you as arranged for and dedicated to the service\r\nof Venus. A fire was always kept laid, which I immediately lighted, but\r\nas it was a bright sunny day, and the place looked south, it was not at\r\nall cold. While I was occupied at the fire, Ellen threw off her bonnet\r\nand shawl, and undid her belt\xe2\x80\x94she wore no stays. I seized her in my\r\narms, and gently laid her on the couch\xe2\x80\x94her petticoats were freely canted\r\nup, showing her beautiful belly and now more fully fledged cunt. I\r\nstooped and gamahuched her at once. She was so excited that in two\r\nminutes she sighed deeply, pressed my head down to the lips of her cunt,\r\nand gave down her sweet and balmy sperm. I myself was already so rampant\r\nthat not waiting to lick it up, I brought my huge pego to the charming\r\norifice, and plunged in one effort up to the hilt, quite taking away her\r\nbreath. But she recovered herself in an instant, and with all the energy\r\nof her younger lubricity, quickly brought us both to the grand final\r\necstasy in which soul and body seem to die away in a joy too great for\r\npoor humanity to bear. We remained locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, and\r\nlost to all around for some time. On coming to our senses I rose, and\r\nsaid we must go to work more lasciviously the next time. The fire having\r\nburnt up, and the room being small, it was already of a pleasant\r\ntemperature. So begging Ellen to strip, I threw off my own clothes, and\r\nwe quickly stood in all the beauty of nature, admiring each other. Some\r\ndelicious preliminaries preceded our next encounter, which we\r\nprocrastinated till passion could no longer be restrained, and again we\r\ndied away in all the raptures of satisfied lust, and sank once more into\r\nthe soft languor of the after-enjoyment. Next we had a mutual gamahuche,\r\nand then a final fuck for the present, as it was time to dress and be\r\nready when called to luncheon. As soon as our toilets were finished, I\r\ntook her on my knee, and told her how I should steal along to her\r\nbedroom at night, so that she must not lock her door. I told her also\r\nthat we must be as quiet as possible, as aunt slept in the next room.\r\nShe was delighted with the prospect of having me all to herself for the\r\nwhole night, naively telling me that I gave her so much more pleasure\r\nthan Harry did, that I seemed to fill her whole body with a joy almost\r\ntoo intense, and now that she was to have me every night, she hoped her\r\naunt would stay away for a month. Here the dear creature threw her arms\r\nround my neck, and kissing me, thrust her sweet little tongue into my\r\nmouth. You may be sure I reciprocated, and putting a hand up her\r\npetticoats, and a finger up her charming little cunt, was just about to\r\nturn her on the sofa, when my aunt opened the door, and stopped further\r\nproceedings. She pretended not to see Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s confusion, hoped I had\r\namused her, and told us to return to the house, as luncheon was ready.\r\nWe, of course, obeyed. With sharpened appetites, produced by our late\r\nwarm exercise, we indulged in a plenteous meal, aunt taking care to ply\r\nme with Champagne, for which, as may well be imagined, she had her\r\nobject. She afterwards ordered me to my room, to do the daily task the\r\ndoctor had set for me and which, as she said, she was to see to the\r\ndoing of\xe2\x80\x94giving me a sly wink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must keep up your practice at the\r\npiano daily, for an hour and a half at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thus separated us. I went to my room, lay down, and fell fast\r\nasleep, but in about half an hour, was awakened by the warm embrace of\r\nmy glorious and wantonly lustful aunt. She stooped down, and taking my\r\nlimp prick in her mouth, rapidly sucked it into its accustomed firmness.\r\nAs soon as that was accomplished, she begged me to rise and undress. She\r\nherself had come only in a loose morning dressing-gown, which she\r\ninstantly threw off, and jumped on my bed, where she lay stark naked, in\r\nall the splendid development of her superb form. I was naked in a\r\njiffey, but knowing she would want some extensive fucking, I threw\r\nmyself upon her cunt, and gamahuched her until she spent twice before I\r\nmounted upon her, and introduced my large tool into her longing cunt.\r\nHere, also, I played with her, and did not spend myself until she had\r\ntwice given down her own contribution. This encounter was on her belly,\r\nwith her magnificent legs twisted above my loins for a fulcrum to her\r\nsplendid action, for few women could equal her in the delicious wriggle\r\nof her glorious backside. After we had soaked for some time in all the\r\necstasies of the after-languour. I withdrew, to place her on her hands\r\nand knees for the next bout, but took advantage of her position to\r\ngamahuche her again into spending twice before I withdrew my insidious\r\ntongue. Then turning round, and gazing in rapture on that most noble and\r\nmassive bottom, which, as I have before remarked, I never saw equalled\r\nby any woman, I stooped, and closely embraced and kissed its divine\r\norifice, tickling her into wild excitement by thrusting my tongue\r\ntherein, so much so that she begged me to fuck her at once. I mounted\r\nbehind, her hand passed under her belly and guided me into her throbbing\r\nhot and longing cunt. I gave one violent lunge, and sent my prick at the\r\nfirst thrust up to the hilt. This so excited the dear creature that in\r\none or two delicious wriggles on my stationary prick, and with a\r\npressure that seemed as if it would nip it off, she spent profusely,\r\nsquealing all the time like a rabbit. I was very glad to give her so\r\nmany discharges, without myself being forced to spend, for I wished to\r\nbe able to do my duty by Ellen at night. Aunt lay for several minutes\r\npanting and throbbing on my prick most deliciously, until I could no\r\nlonger bear to be inactive, although the pleasure of looking down on the\r\nglorious and palpitating orbs below me had given me the greatest\r\nsatisfaction. But now stooping down upon her, I passed one hand under to\r\nexcite her clitoris, and with the other took hold of one of her\r\nbeautiful large and hard bubbies, and began manipulating its nipples\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nproceeding most powerfully exciting to dear auntie. It awoke all her\r\nlust and the dear lascivious creature again spent before I was ready to\r\nfollow suit. The pause that followed allowed my excitement to subside a\r\nlittle, and enabled me to hold out until her lust recovered its wonted\r\nenergy. She again, with her pressures and movements, soon compelled me\r\nto more rapid action, but this time I determined to enjoy the exquisite\r\ndelights of her delicious bottom-hole. So when she became very hot, I\r\nsuddenly withdrew, and, happily, hitting at once on the delicious\r\norifice, plunged at the first thrust up to the cods, taking dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreath away, but she instantly recovered, and loving sodomy to her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s core, I could not have done anything better suited to her\r\nlibidinous passions. It was glorious to see the energy with which she\r\nmet and responded to my thrusts, her superb buttocks working with\r\nsurprising energy, and giving me, at each stroke, when I buried my prick\r\nto the hilt, the most exciting pressures. Both being so lustfully\r\nexcited, matters were not long in coming to the final ecstasy. I felt as\r\nif my whole soul was poured into her, when with loud cries of the\r\nliveliest enjoyment, I spent with fury, in the very heart of her\r\nentrails. She was perfectly overcome with delight, and sank senseless on\r\nher belly, dragging me down with her, for her grip by the sphincter was\r\ntoo strong to let anything out that was within. We both became\r\ninsensible to everything but the delicious death-like languor of the\r\nafter-enjoyment. We lay long in this trance of joy, and when dear auntie\r\ncame to her senses, she begged me to rise, as she must go downstairs. I\r\ndid so, and when she rose from the bed, she took me in her loving arms,\r\nand kissing me tenderly, thanked me for the enormous pleasure I had\r\ngiven her, and said no one in the world was my equal, and that I ought\r\nto thank her much, that she allowed anyone else to participate in my\r\nexquisite power of fuck. She gathered up her gown, and left me to dress.\r\nI soon was downstairs, and found Ellen, who looked as if she expected me\r\nto find an opportunity to fuck her at once. But after the encounters I\r\nhad already had, both with her and with aunt, though I had kept myself\r\nfrom excess with the latter, I felt no inclination to press matters\r\nagain to a conclusion, especially seeing that I intended passing the\r\nnight with her. So assuring her we should be likely to be caught if\r\nimprudent and so lose all chance of night work, she was satisfied to be\r\nquiet and reasonable. Aunt coming in, we spent the afternoon in pleasant\r\nconversation, and a walk together in the garden. After dinner I fell\r\nsound asleep on the sofa. The two women, each with the same object, left\r\nme to my deep repose, and only awoke me when it was time for all to\r\nretire. Thus refreshed, I was all ready for the night\xe2\x80\x99s work before me.\r\nI allowed half an hour to elapse, that all the house might to be in\r\ntheir bedrooms, and then, with merely a loose dressing-gown on, I stole\r\nalong to dear Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s room, opened the door and entered. She was already\r\nin bed, impatient for my arrival; she had left both lights burning, as\r\nwell as a cheerful blaze from a good fire. I dropped my robe, and was in\r\nan instant stark naked, and in her longing arms. Under our mutual\r\nimpatience, our first was a rapid course. Then followed a long enjoyment\r\nof the after-languor, and then a more prolonged and rapturous embrace.\r\nAfter soaking in bliss for some time, we rose, and I posed her before\r\nthe fire, gazing delightedly on all her young charms. The hair on her\r\ncunt had become much more developed than before, her bosom too was\r\nfilled out, even her hips and bottom seemed enlarged, doubtless owing to\r\nthe fucking she had had since I first knew her, which naturally hastened\r\nher ripening into womanhood. I grew very excited by this inspection of\r\nher increasing charms, and determined to have a fuck on the rug before\r\nthe fire. In order to enjoy it the more, I drew forward a cheval glass,\r\nprojected it forward, and lying down, directed her to move it until I\r\nwas satisfied I could see all the play of her bottom in the position I\r\nmeant to fuck her. So lying down on my back, I made her stride across my\r\nhead and settle down on her knees, and bringing forward her delicious\r\nlittle cunt over my mouth, I gamahuched her until she had twice given\r\ndown her balmy essence. Then she shifted her position lower down, until\r\njust above my prick, which by this time was rampant with desire. I\r\nguided its point to the rosy-lipped orbit, and bringing her own weight\r\nto bear upon it, she sank delightfully impaled upon the upright stake. I\r\nmade her rise and fall a few times, that I might enjoy the sight of its\r\nentrance and exit. Then gently drawing her down upon me, I folded one\r\narm round her slender waist, and turning my head, found that the cheval\r\nglass, inclined forward, reflected as it were from above her beautiful\r\nbottom and back, and of course her cunt stretched to the utmost with my\r\nhuge prick, and above it the sweet little corrugated pink aperture of\r\nher bottom. With my free arm I embraced one hip, and bringing my hand\r\nround, moistened it with the plenteous spunk of her cunt, and insinuated\r\na finger into the smaller abode of bliss. Her excitement grew furious,\r\nand knew no bounds. The action of her backside was glorious to see\r\nreflected in its active risings and fallings. I let her do all the work,\r\nwhich enabled me to hold back my own, until she approached a second\r\ndischarge, when the heat of her cunt seemed to fire me with additional\r\npowers, and the action of both our backsides became fast and furious,\r\nand soon brought down the ecstatic discharge, which instantly laid us\r\nlow, panting with all the wild passions we had just allayed. We lay long\r\nlocked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms in the ecstasy of blissful enjoyment. Then\r\nrising, we embraced tenderly, and retook us to bed. I would have excited\r\nher and myself to another effort, but she begged off, saying that she\r\nfelt quite exhausted and overcome with the day and night\xe2\x80\x99s work we had\r\nalready enjoyed. Indeed, I did not wonder at it, for I had made her\r\nspend seven or eight times more than myself. Nor did I regret her\r\nresolution, as I knew the morning would bring my aunt into the field,\r\nand then the two would try my powers to the utmost.\r\n\r\nWe slept profoundly, and morning was already advanced before we awoke.\r\nFrom a displaced chair I saw that aunt had been in to look at us, so I\r\nknew she was on the watch. I threw the clothes off dear Ellen that I\r\nmight gaze on all her young charms. The want of covering awoke her. She\r\nlovingly looked up at me, and throwing her arms round my neck as I bent\r\nover her, drew my head down to hers, and impressed a loving kiss on my\r\nlips. Our tongues interlaced\xe2\x80\x94a hand slipped down and encircled my\r\nrampant and throbbing prick. I turned, and placing my knees between her\r\nlegs, was about to penetrate love\xe2\x80\x99s bower when the door leading to my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s room flew open. My aunt entered, gave a scream of surprise\xe2\x80\x94well\r\nacted\xe2\x80\x94and cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious! What do I see? Who would have thought it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, apparently to save Ellen, she rushed forward, seized me by the arm,\r\nand with a certain degree of willingness on my part, drew me out of bed,\r\nsaying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am horrified beyond measure. How dare you commit such a sin and crime\r\nas to seduce a young girl under my care? Cover yourself up, sir,\r\ndirectly, and go to your own room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI boldly declared I would do no such thing; on the contrary, as she had\r\nspoiled my sport with Ellen, I was determined she should pay for it\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you talk to me, you dreadful boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot dreadful at all, dear aunt, look at this poor dumb thing, and see\r\nhow he longs to be into you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon this I seized her in my arms as if to throw her on the bed. She\r\nmade a pretended struggle, during which she gave a tender squeeze to my\r\nrampant prick. Then, breaking from me, she fled to her own room,\r\npretending to endeavour to shut the door in my face but taking care to\r\ngive way and hasten towards her bed. I caught hold of her as she bent\r\nforward as if to get into it, and canting up her chemise, the only\r\narticle of dress she wore, I was into her longing and luscious cunt from\r\nbehind up to the hilt in one thrust. She gave a subdued scream, and\r\ncalled to Ellen to come and prevent me from violating her. Ellen came,\r\nbut wisely would only look on while I worked away manfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you pull him away\xe2\x80\x94he is ravishing me\xe2\x80\x94and oh,\r\nhorror!\xe2\x80\x94committing incest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pretended to struggle greatly, but cleverly did so to her own\r\nprofit, by wriggling her backside so as to send me further up into her\r\ncunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Ellen, Ellen, do help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellen, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall let him do it, and then you cannot tell\r\nupon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy aunt seemed greatly distressed at this, and actually managed to shed\r\ntears, then buried her face in the bed as if in despair, but all the\r\ntime most actively seconding me. As the crisis drew near, she raised her\r\nhead, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven pardon me, this mere simple schoolboy is exciting me to such\r\npleasure as I never before felt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then gave way to all her lubricity, and we brought matters to a\r\ncrisis in the utmost ecstasy of enjoyment. Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s head sank on the bed,\r\nwhile the rapturous inward pressures of her cunt soon began to raise my\r\nprick to its pristine vigour. She felt its throbs and responded to them,\r\nbut no doubt thinking that an immediate repetition would betray our\r\nprevious intimacy, she turned her face and body suddenly round, and\r\ncompletely unseated me, my prick coming out with a plop. She began again\r\nto weep, women can do so at pleasure, and to scold me for the dreadful\r\ncrime I had committed; to do so to her was incest\xe2\x80\x94here followed sob upon\r\nsob. I threw my arms round her neck, and kissing her tears away, laid\r\nall the blame on that rampant fellow\xe2\x80\x94taking her hand and placing it on\r\nmy still stiff prick. She drew her hand away quickly, but not before she\r\nhad given it a gentle squeeze. She told me I was a dreadful boy, and\r\nthat I must go away and leave her and Ellen to think over what could be\r\ndone in such an awful dilemma.\r\n\r\nHere Ellen came forward, and tenderly kissing her begged her not to send\r\nme away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so love him, dear madam, and I do so long to have him now\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nso exciting to see him having you, that I shall die if you don\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nhave him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful! dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d said aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought I was just in time to\r\nsave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, he had slept with me all night, and has often had me before,\r\nbut he was not the first who had me, so that there was no violation nor\r\nseduction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must have seduced him, you wicked minx, for a more innocent\r\nboy never was known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Ellen, confounded at the accusation, repelled it as untrue, and\r\nsaid she knew well enough who seduced me.\r\n\r\nAunt for the moment felt this as a home thrust, for be it remembered,\r\nshe fancied she had had my maidenhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that? I insist upon you speaking out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen gave way and said it was Mrs. Dale who first had me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had accidentally seen how powerfully Charlie was armed, and then\r\ncould not resist teaching him how to use his weapon. I saw them doing\r\nit, and hence I longed for it myself. Look, dear madam, what a noble one\r\nit is. I am sure, if you had known of it, you could not yourself have\r\nresisted having it, try it, try it once more, and I am sure you will\r\nforgive us, and share our joys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI seconded this good advice. Aunt seemed to be afraid of me, and jumped\r\ninto bed. While she was on her hands and knees I also jumped up, and\r\ncatching her round the waist, held her fast until I could also kneel\r\nbehind her and bring my prick into play. With all her apparent attempt\r\nat resistance everything was done in such a way as to facilitate rather\r\nthan prevent matters going forward. Of course I was in her in a moment,\r\nand then remained quiet for a few minutes to let her enjoy her inward\r\npressures for which she was so famous. She had buried her head in the\r\npillow, crying out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dreadful!\xe2\x80\x94it is dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen came and leant over the bed embracing her, and telling her not to\r\nresist, but to take it in freely, and then she was sure it would give\r\nher the utmost pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that which horrifies me, my dear, I never felt anything so\r\nexquisite in my life before, but then think of the sin\xe2\x80\x94with my own\r\nnephew! it is quite an incestuous connection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that matter, dear aunt? for I shall call you aunt too, you\r\nare so lovable and so beautiful. Oh, it was such a pleasure to see him\r\ndoing it to you and you are so gloriously fine a woman, I longed to be a\r\nman to have you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had embraced aunt\xe2\x80\x99s splendid bubbies, than which nothing could more\r\nplease her, and now she begged to be allowed to suck one. Aunt gave way,\r\nand was delighted. She slipped the hand next to Ellen down to her\r\ncharming cunt\xe2\x80\x94Ellen opened her legs\xe2\x80\x94Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s fingers began frigging her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear, how I loved to embrace my own sex at your age, our tongues\r\nacted instead of men, and I could still delight in a fine fresh one like\r\nthis, it would almost reconcile me to what this bad wicked boy is\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that would be charming!\xe2\x80\x94do let us do it at once. Charlie can\r\nwithdraw for a moment while I get under you, and while you lick me I can\r\nexcite you and see the glorious work above me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tempt me much, my dear girl, but what would your aunt say if she\r\nknew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she never will know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ellen, who was all the time arranging\r\nherself on the bed.\r\n\r\nAunt moved aside to allow Ellen to get under her, who then begged aunt\r\nto throw off her chemise that both their bodies might be in close\r\ncontact. Aunt was longing to do so, yet made some grimaces about it.\r\nShe at length complied, and striding across Ellen, threw herself with\r\navidity on the delicious young cunt below, and began to gamahuche her\r\n_\xc3\xa0 mort_. I instantly resumed my position. Ellen guided my prick into\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s burning cunt, then frigged aunt\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris, and worked a finger\r\nin my fundament, while aunt was so delightfully gamahuching her. We all\r\nrapidly came to the grand finale, with an excess of lubricity rarely\r\nequalled. We were all somewhat exhausted by this bout, and, as it was\r\ngetting late, we rose. Aunt pretended to forgive my violating her for\r\nthe pleasure I afterwards afforded her. She embraced Ellen tenderly,\r\nand said she had so enjoyed her person she hoped to renew such a\r\ndelight. Then taking hold of my prick she kissed it and sucked it until\r\nit stood upright, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder, my dear, at your having it when once you had seen it,\r\nand I envy Mrs. Dale the pleasure of having first enjoyed such a\r\nmonstrous thing. If I had known he was so wondrously provided, I doubt\r\nif I could have resisted the temptation to teach him how to make use of\r\nit myself\xe2\x80\x94my only wonder is how such a little thing as you have got\r\ncould ever take it in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen laughed, and said that her cousin Harry had opened the way, or she\r\ndoubted if ever she could have admitted it, but I was so gentle while\r\ngetting in, and when once in, it filled up every crevice so deliciously,\r\nthat she should grieve much if she were refused access to it in future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, dear aunt, I hope you will let him do it to us both. I can do to\r\nyou what you have just done to me, because before we had him and Harry,\r\naunt and I used to amuse ourselves in that way. Aunt is immense in that\r\nparticular, she could put it a little way into me, and gave me great\r\npleasure, and she said that I sucked it better than either her late\r\nhusband or any of half-a-dozen schoolfellows who used to amuse each\r\nother; so, dear aunt, you must let me do it to you while Charlie is in\r\nme, and then you will do it to me while he is in you. Only fancy how\r\nnice it will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you dear little coaxer, you are enough to seduce an angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo all was arranged that Ellen should come from her room and I from\r\nmine, and meet in aunt\xe2\x80\x99s bed at night. We did so meet, and a most\r\nglorious eight days we spent. I showed aunt that I could get into\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole, and thereby gave her immense pleasure, and with\r\nmore reason the same result would occur with her. She gave an apparently\r\nreluctant consent, and, that done, there was no bridle to the utmost\r\nlubricity that the most wanton lust could devise. Aunt took immensely to\r\nEllen, and gamahuched her _\xc3\xa0 mort_, while the other repaid her in kind.\r\nI did not regret this for it relieved me from too excessive work. Thus\r\nwe passed a most delightful eight days before the absent ones joined us.\r\nBoth uncle and Harry had succeeded in their desires. From each I had the\r\nfullest details, but as their stories would in some particulars repeat\r\nthemselves, I shall relate the events in a connected narrative.\r\n\r\nUncle and Mrs. Dale had the inside of the coach to themselves, Harry\r\nriding outside. Uncle began by praising Harry; and then reverting to the\r\ntime he was first sent to the rectory, and the note Mrs. Dale sent with\r\nhim; he asked, not without a knowing smile, if the intimacy she had\r\nformerly feared had been at all renewed, because he had observed that\r\nHarry appeared worn and pale on his return on the Mondays, and was dull\r\nand stupid that day. Mrs. Dale seemed somewhat alarmed at hearing of\r\nthis, probably she began to think that something might have occurred\r\nbetween the cousins while she was busied with me, uncle observed her\r\nuneasiness, and, guessing the cause, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mrs. Dale, if anything has taken place, and anything comes of\r\nit, I am a man of the world, and you may rely upon my assistance and\r\ndiscretion to take such steps as may tend to keep it from the knowledge\r\nof the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thanked him, and said she would be glad to accept his aid if any\r\nunfortunate event should have happened\xe2\x80\x94but she hoped not.\r\n\r\nUncle saw that her fears were excited, so he held onto the subject, so\r\nat last she avowed that she feared there might have occurred some\r\npassages between the two cousins, for she had foolishly trusted that all\r\nthought of that had gone out of their heads, and she might not have\r\ntaken such precautions as she ought to have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear madame, my services are at your disposal in case of any\r\nnecessity, I am not in reality strait-laced, although, in my position, I\r\nam obliged to appear so. I feel certain that my experience would be able\r\nto suggest the best way of hushing up the scandal if such should be\r\nlikely to occur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was profuse in thanks, and the doctor became warmer in his\r\ndiscourse, saying that for such a woman as herself, whom he had long\r\nadmired and coveted, he would do anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor, my dear madam, though I am in the church, something of the old\r\nAdam still adheres to me, and the sight and touch of one who has so\r\ncharmed me as you have done makes a young man of me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere his arm glided round her charming little waist. He drew her to him,\r\nand with some coyness and words of refusal, she yielded her lips to his\r\nembrace. His other hand, lifting up her petticoats, sought to feel her\r\nbeauteous cunt. Again resistance of hand and tongue, but a yielding for\r\nall that, and the doctor soon got possession of her lovely cunt. Finding\r\nher large and fine clitoris in a state of stiffness, he knew that her\r\npassions were excited. So opening her legs, he got between them down on\r\nhis knees, and as he previously unbuttoned his trousers in readiness and\r\nthe fresh cunt stimulating his powers, he pulled out his prick fully\r\nerected, and quickly established himself up to the hilt within, the lady\r\nup to the last declaring she could not allow him, but wriggling her\r\nbottom to perfection as soon as she felt the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s very fine prick\r\nworking within her. She then hugged and seconded him, kissing and\r\ntongueing to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire. They soon brought things to the\r\necstatic conclusion, to the great satisfaction of both parties.\r\n\r\nOf course, after this there was no difficulty in arranging for a\r\ncomfortable meeting in London. Indeed, it was resolved that they should\r\nlodge in the same house and have contiguous apartments. On their arrival\r\nin town they put up at one of those large lodging houses in Norfolk\r\nStreet, Strand, and were fortunate in finding the first-floor bedrooms\r\nvacant. The house was a double one, or rather two houses opening into\r\neach other. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom was in the front, and a former door of\r\ncommunication with the back room was locked on one side and bolted on\r\nthe other. Mrs. Dale took the back room, from whence opened a small room\r\nwith a bed in it, where Harry was lodged. The doctor had thus easy\r\naccess when the lady chose to withdraw the bolt on her side. After\r\nconsultation it was thought more advisable that she should go into the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s room, so that Harry might not by any possibility, hear any love\r\nexclamations that might happen to escape them in the excess of their\r\namorous amusements. Of course, the doctor, who knew all about Harry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat desire to fuck his mother, and that he meant to do so by one way\r\nor another in London, communicated his intention of having Mrs. Dale\r\ninto sleep with him that night, and, therefore, begged Harry to defer\r\nhis attempt until after the first night, and then the doctor would aid\r\nhim in his efforts.\r\n\r\nThe wily doctor fully intended, after Harry had perfectly succeeded, to\r\nbecome the future companion of their incestuous intercourse. Harry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom door had one of those old-fashioned brass locks that were\r\nscrewed onto the inside of the door, with a brass covering for the bolt\r\nat the side\xe2\x80\x94not morticed as is now usual. Mrs. Dale locked her son in\r\nafter he retired to bed. Harry noticed the circumstance and smiled to\r\nthink how easily he could foil her but as he had promised the doctor to\r\nmake no attempt on his mother that night, he went to bed and slept\r\nsoundly. Next day he provided himself with a turn-screw and a small\r\nphial of sweet oil. When mamma was busy at cards, he slipped upstairs\r\nand easily unscrewed the brass receiver of the bolt, he oiled the screws\r\nand worked them in and out until they went freely and then screwed the\r\ncovering on again, and felt secure of entering mamma\xe2\x80\x99s room whenever he\r\npleased. It had been combined between the doctor and him that by means\r\nof gamahuching and frigging, mamma should be put into a state of great\r\nexcitement without allowing her to be satisfied, so that her passions\r\nmight be in favour of being fucked, no matter by what prick. For this\r\npurpose the doctor was to keep her with him till dawn. At night Harry\r\nwatched through the key hole, and when he saw his mother pass into the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s room, he at once unscrewed the covering, shot back the bolt,\r\nand screwed the cover on again. He was thus all ready for any event, and\r\nif his mother was astonished at his entrance, he could say he found the\r\ndoor open, and she must have forgotten to lock it. Thus prepared he went\r\nto bed and slept soundly. He was awake before seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and gently\r\nopening the door a little, he could see by the opposite open door, and\r\nthe light in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s room, that mamma had not yet left him. He drew\r\non his woollen socks, and sitting where the light flashed through the\r\nkey hole, awaited his mamma\xe2\x80\x99s return, which occurred very shortly after.\r\nThe shutting off the light by closing the door of communication told him\r\nthat she had returned to her own room. He heard her sit down on the pot,\r\nand the force of the flow of water proved how healthy she was. He heard\r\nher rustle into bed. Then throwing off his dressing-gown and socks he\r\nopened the door and approached his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Being awake, she\r\ninstantly saw him in the half-daylight that came from the unshuttered\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry! What on earth brings you here, and how did you open the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you moving, dear mamma, I could not sleep for the cold. I got\r\nup and tried the door, it was not locked, you must have omitted to turn\r\nthe bolt, but I should have rapped and called to you, if it had not been\r\nopen. I want you to let me get warm in your nice warm bed, and you will\r\ncuddle your poor Harry\xe2\x80\x94will you not, dear mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will be quiet, and speak lower, for the doctor may hear you, you\r\nmay come in, and if you turn your back, I will warm you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry lost no time in lying down by her side, and being really very\r\ncold, and even shivering, he was glad enough to do as she bid him, and\r\nturn his back, and cuddle his bottom into his mother\xe2\x80\x99s belly. She said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor boy, he is indeed cold, now go to sleep in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, he had no such intentions. Speedily getting warm, he turned\r\nhis face to mamma, and whispered, in the same tone she used\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how I love my beautiful mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPressing his belly against hers, and letting her feel his prick standing\r\nagainst her mons Veneris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry! What do you mean by embracing me in that way\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know I am\r\nyour mother, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had seized with one hand her beautiful firm bubbies, and was\r\nevidently in full amorous excitement, as she could feel by the stiff\r\npego pushing against her mount of Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling mamma, if you knew how much I love you and how I have longed\r\nto embrace your beautiful body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along, you impudent boy, do you not know it would be sinful to\r\nindulge in such sentiments with your mother\xe2\x80\x94leave me directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, mamma, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, indeed, my own mamma. I mean to possess you,\r\nwhat harm can there be in returning to whence I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he transferred his hand from her bubby to her splendid mons\r\nVeneris, and showed what his words meant. She pretended to be very\r\nangry, and endeavoured to push him away, but he held her round the waist\r\nwith his other arm too well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDesist this instant, or I shall cry out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe really appeared very angry but, nevertheless, did not excite a\r\nwhisper during all the colloquy before or after. Harry now thought of\r\nhis best argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you attempt to repulse me in this way, dear mamma? Why should\r\nyou not let me enjoy your person as much as you like Charlie to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a start at this home thrust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, you naughty boy? and where did you hear such a\r\nfalsehood as that? Is that one of your friend Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s inventions,\r\nafter all the kindness I have shown him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling mamma, Charlie never opened his lips to me on the subject. I\r\nspeak from what I saw with my own eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Tell me directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my loved mamma, do you remember the first Saturday night that\r\nCharlie and I slept at home: after retiring to my room, I was obliged to\r\ngo downstairs to the water closet, where I went in my stockings, and\r\nwithout a light, not to disturb you. I was coming up again, when a\r\nsudden flash of light shone out in the upper passage. Mounting the\r\nstairs, and when my head was on a level with the upper floor, I saw you\r\ngoing towards Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s room. I went into my own, but left the door open\r\nto see when you would return; finding you did not come back, I crept\r\nsoftly along the passage, until I came to the turning that led to\r\nCharlie\xe2\x80\x99s room. The light shone through the key hole. I quietly\r\napproached. You know the bed exactly faces the door\xe2\x80\x94and there, my\r\ndarling mamma, I saw you initiate Charlie into what was to him a\r\npreviously unknown pleasure. Oh! my beloved mother, the sight of your\r\nnaked charms, of the delicious way in which you were giving him his\r\nfirst lesson in love, maddened me with desire. I was almost tempted to\r\ncome in upon you and violate you, if you would not consent. It was in\r\nthat state I remembered that Ellen was asleep in your bed. I ran there,\r\nand throwing off the little I had on, I lay down beside her, and began\r\nfeeling her private parts. She awoke and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dear aunt, do you wish me to do the same to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer hand passed down to my erect member, she gave a cry of\r\nastonishment. I whispered it was only me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you must leave me directly. Aunt can only have gone to the water\r\ncloset, and will be back directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was not to be pacified until I convinced her that there was no\r\nchance of your speedy return, so I was obliged to bring her along to\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s door; we saw you quite naked, rising and falling on the\r\nenormous weapon that Charles has. I never before saw it erect and could\r\nscarcely believe my eyes; nor was it less wonderful the way in which you\r\nso charmingly took it in. It greatly excited Ellen, as well as me. We\r\nreturned to your room\xe2\x80\x94the fire still burned. I laid her down on the rug\r\nbefore it, and took her maidenhead. She had seen how Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s monstrous\r\naffair went easily into you, and felt how much less mine was, so she\r\nnever dreamt of it hurting her, and she let me get fairly within the\r\nlips; then, while making her spend, I suddenly thrust it through all\r\nimpediments, and the affair was done; she gave a scream, as it hurt her,\r\nbut I had shut the door and none of you heard it. I let her sleep after\r\nthis, and did not do it again till morning. The next night we again\r\nwatched your delicious proceeding. Ellen was less sore, and we repeated\r\nyour example several times. She continues to this day to wonder at the\r\nenormous size of Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s tool, and is surprised at your taking it in\r\nso easily. But, oh, my mother, how my passions have been excited by your\r\nglorious charms. What is Ellen compared with you? She did very well to\r\nrelieve my agony of desire to possess you, when I knew you were better\r\noccupied, and that I could not do so\xe2\x80\x94but that is all. It is you, and you\r\nalone, my beloved mother, whom I adore, and I wildly long to possess\r\nthis dear and magnificent cunt beneath my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Dale was perfectly\r\nflabbergasted at this recital. \xe2\x80\x9cYou abominable boy, how dared you to\r\nfollow me, and be a spy upon your mother, and to make it known to Ellen,\r\ntoo; doubtless you have been boasting of it, and telling others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, mamma, Ellen and I were on oath that we would never reveal\r\nto any mortal the delicious sight we had seen\xe2\x80\x94so you see, darling mamma,\r\nthat you can fully trust your own boy. Oh, do let me do it; feel how my\r\npoor thing throbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I must give you Harry\xe2\x80\x99s own account of what took place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took her hand with very little resistance, and I could feel her\r\nfingers gently clasped my prick, before she withdrew her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no\xe2\x80\x94it cannot be\xe2\x80\x94it would be incest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe twisted her body round, so that her magnificent bottom came against\r\nmy belly. As she turned, I slipped my hand down, and laid hold of her\r\nshift, so that in turning, it left her bottom bare, and sticking out\r\nagainst me. I lost not an instant, and before she had quite settled\r\ndown, I brought my stiff-standing pego against her delicious cunt from\r\nbehind, and as it was reeking from her previous spendings produced by\r\nthe rector\xe2\x80\x99s gamahuching, I plunged it at one shove as far as her\r\nbuttocks against my belly would allow, at the same time dropping my hand\r\nfrom her waist to her cunt, so that when she sprang forward, as if to\r\nturn me out, I met her clitoris, it was quite stiff, showing her to be\r\nreally in a state of amorous excitement. This attack on the clitoris\r\nmade her as quickly move back, which double movement thoroughly\r\nengulphed me. I lost no time in proceeding to the most active movements\r\nin and out. This was too much for her, she could not resist entering\r\ninto the encounter with all the force of her passions, and we ran a very\r\nrapid course, ending in the most ecstatic delight, and with sighs of joy\r\nwe lay clasped together in all the delicious after-languor. I could feel\r\nby her exquisite internal pressures that her lust was not yet\r\nalleviated, and this nerved me to fresh efforts. After a feigned\r\nresistance, dear mamma passed her hand behind her, and putting it on my\r\nbuttocks, assisted in sending me further in at each home thrust. We were\r\nlonger this bout, and enjoyed it more. After the usual indulgence in the\r\nafter-joy, she turned, and embracing me tenderly said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear child, this is very wrong, but very delicious. You must be\r\nvery discreet, my dear Harry, for if it were known it would disgrace us\r\nboth for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My sweet mamma, do not fear; have you ever seen anything like\r\nindiscretion in the last six weeks, although I was madly longing for\r\nyou? Oh, kiss me, my beloved mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sweetest of kisses followed, our tongues met, her hand wandered;\r\nalready she found my pego standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My darling, I must kiss it, it is so much more developed than I could\r\nhave expected, and as hard as iron.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Not as large as Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s, mamma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That is true, my dear; but it is the stiffness, and not the size, that\r\ngives the real pleasure. Of course, when both are combined, as with\r\nCharlie, they are irresistible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile I was feeling her cunt: her clitoris, which you know is\r\nlargely developed, stood stiff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mamma, darling, what a size this is. Ellen told me you could put it\r\ninto her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh! the bad girl, to tell tales out of school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, mamma, I must suck it while you play with mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned on my back with my heels up\xe2\x80\x94mamma lay down upon my belly\r\nreversed. I sucked her clitty while frigging her cunt, and she sucked my\r\nprick until we both spent, and each licked or sucked all the balmy sperm\r\nthat issued from the other. We continued our caresses until my prick\r\nshowed its readiness for another encounter. Mamma took me on her belly\r\nthis time, and as soon as I was engulphed, threw her legs over my loins,\r\nand, by the most lascivious actions, contributed to our enjoyment. Her\r\nglorious bottom heaved in unison with mine, our tongues were interlaced,\r\nand at last with sweet murmurs of delight, we died away in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms in the most luxurious ecstasy of thoroughly gratified desire. We\r\nlay long insensible of all around, throbbing in pressures of lascivious\r\ndelight, which would have soon led to another love bout, but that mamma\r\nwhispered it would be imprudent to continue, for the sun was up, and\r\nbreakfast time had arrived. I withdrew from the sweet cunt with great\r\nregret, and in slipping out of bed brought my mouth down to it, and gave\r\nit a loving kiss and suck, played with the magnificent covering of bushy\r\nringlets, and then tore myself away with difficulty. Thus ended my first\r\npossession of my adored and glorious mother, which was followed by night\r\nupon night of the most lascivious enjoyment. I returned to my room, and\r\nwas dressed and downstairs before her. The doctor took an opportunity to\r\ninform me that she had excused herself from joining him the next night\r\non the pretence of not feeling well, but in reality it was to have me\r\nall to herself for the whole night; and a most delicious night it was.\r\nShe displayed and exercised her libidinous passions to the utmost. Never\r\nbefore had I such a treat. It was, perhaps, the closeness of the\r\nrelationship that added to the excitement, but it appeared to me that\r\nshe beat even the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s splendid wife. Oh, she was so loving, too.\r\nThe way she fondled me in her arms and caressed me was irresistible. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t tell how often we did it\xe2\x80\x94we were at it all night. The next night,\r\nunder pretence of fearing to exhaust me, she forced me to retire to my\r\nroom after two fucks, and locked me in. I had previously been informed\r\nby the doctor that he had bespoken her for that night, and he begged me\r\nto fuck her first, that the pleasure of gamahuching her might be\r\nenhanced. I, therefore, did not do more than make a feigned resistance\r\nto her when she told me I must go to my own bed. She said she would let\r\nme have one embrace before she rose in the morning but that one was\r\nconverted into two exquisite spends. The next night the doctor wished to\r\nrepose, as he purposed surprising me in the morning. I laid myself out\r\nfor this, and when mamma was asleep I rose as if to piddle. I unbolted\r\nthe door and shook up the doctor, and then returned to bed. I had agreed\r\nwith him to make more noise than usual in the final ecstasy; he was to\r\nwait long enough to allow of the after-enjoyment, as if he was taking\r\ntime to clothe himself a little, and was then to come in with a light.\r\nMy mother still slept. It was about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. I began\r\nfeeling her glorious buttocks, and, sliding under the clothes, turned\r\nher legs apart\xe2\x80\x94she insensibly slipped upon her back, I took her charming\r\nclitoris between my lips, and soon sucked it into stiffness. The\r\nexcitement awoke her\xe2\x80\x94she had dreamed I was fucking her\xe2\x80\x94and so was hot\r\nand randy. She drew me upon her bosom, threw the clothes off, and her\r\nglorious limbs clasped my loins\xe2\x80\x94her two hands pressed on my buttocks, as\r\nif to drive me further home, and we ran a most delicious course, I\r\nfeigned to be even still more excited than I really was, and almost\r\nbrayed at the ecstatic moment of ejection. Mamma herself was too far\r\ngone in delight to notice the loudness of my braying. She lay panting\r\nand throbbing on my prick, almost in a state of insensibility to aught\r\nelse beside. Her eyes were closed, so that she did not observe the\r\nentrance of the light carried by the doctor. It was not until he was\r\nstanding by the bedside, and made an exclamation of surprise, that she\r\nwas aware of his presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave a scream\xe2\x80\x94though not very loud\xe2\x80\x94and covered her eyes with her\r\nhand. I scrambled off her. The doctor, with great politeness, begged her\r\npardon for his intrusion, but hearing what appeared to him an unearthly\r\nnoise, he had feared she was taken ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere the usual resource of woman\xe2\x80\x94tears\xe2\x80\x94fell plentifully from mamma. The\r\ndoctor most affectionately begged her to calm herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I do not in any way blame you for this. I am\r\na man of the world, and I know that incest is practised to a far greater\r\nextent than is at all imagined, and to prove that it in no way offends\r\nme, I may at once tell you that it was my own mother who initiated me\r\ninto these delightful mysteries. I see that this dear boy looks terribly\r\nfrightened at my being a witness to the delight he must have had; but to\r\nput him at his ease, we may as well inform him that we, too, have\r\nindulged in that delicious game. I may add that this is not the first\r\ntime I have joined in orgies with more than one man or woman, and\r\nnothing gives me more pleasure than to embrace one reeking from the arms\r\nof another, especially if I have been a witness to the previous\r\nencounter. See, my dear madam, how this dear instrument stands stiff in\r\nproof of what I say, and to insure my silence dear Harry must not object\r\nto my enjoying you after and before him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo saying he dropt off his trousers and jumped into bed. He was met\r\nwith feeble remonstrances from my mother at doing it before her son: but\r\nI assured her that I rather preferred to see her at work, as she knew,\r\nthan otherwise, especially as she evidently enjoyed it so much. So the\r\ndoctor forthwith mounted her. There could be no doubt that she enjoyed\r\nit equally with him. My cock stood at the sight. I put it into her hand,\r\nand she squeezed it lovingly\xe2\x80\x94then stooping I sucked one nipple, and you\r\nknow how this excites her, and slipped a hand behind the doctor, and\r\nafter gently tickling his ballocks, acted postillion to his bottom-hole.\r\nThey ran a most exciting course and died away in mutual raptures. No\r\nsooner did he turn off than I jumped up into his place, and in one\r\nmoment was up to the cods in that overflowing cunt. Mamma feebly\r\nexpostulated, but the doctor begged her to let him have the pleasure of\r\nwitnessing the vigour of the youth. I knew that in heart mamma was\r\ndelighted, for all women especially enjoy having a fresh prick into them\r\nimmediately after a previous one has been withdrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis is quite true\xe2\x80\x94witness my own dear Benson in our early days; her\r\ngreatest delight was to have me the instant B. retired, and she avowed\r\nthat nothing could give her greater pleasure. I knew a lady in\r\nafter-life whom I and three others used to have together, and no sooner\r\nwas one off than another was on and sometimes two at once. She used to\r\ntell us how she deceived her husband. When at Florence she had eight\r\nlovers, and she had had them all on the same night without any of them\r\nknowing of the others. She managed it in this way. She made them\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94two at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, two at half-past ten, two at eleven, and two a\r\nhalf-past eleven. They were put in four different rooms with convenient\r\nsofas. She ran to No. 1 in a merely loose robe, which was instantly\r\nthrown off. She was a magnificently made creature, the sight of whose\r\ncharms would inflame anyone. She rapidly got two goes from the first\r\nwithout withdrawing. Then saying that her husband would be seeking her\r\nif she did not leave him, she rang for her German valet, who used to\r\nfuck her himself, and who afterwards confirmed her story to me, who\r\nshowed my gentleman out of the room. Off she ran to No. 2, told him she\r\nhad only got away by letting her husband have a go, and that he thought\r\nshe had only gone to the water closet so he must do one good and leave\r\nher. Of course the cunt full of fuck only excited him the more, and he\r\nvery soon racked off to her great satisfaction, and was dismissed,\r\nleaving the rooms vacant for the two at eleven. As there was not five\r\nminutes to spare she ran to No. 3, where another lover was waiting. The\r\nsame pretence was made as to the last, but as he was largely hung, she\r\ngot two coups from him and then packed him off, and in the same way ran\r\nto the others, always with the same story, getting two coups out of\r\nthree running, who were the best fuckers, and waiting with the last\r\nuntil he could do no more.\r\n\r\nThe same lady told me that once while living at Dieppe her husband ran\r\nover to England for a few days. During his absence she had four young\r\nmen to supper every night, and made them all fuck her on the sofa squabs\r\nlaid on the floor, accommodating one in her bottom at the same time.\r\nDuring the day her landlord, a married man, used to come in and rack her\r\noff besides. At one time she was left alone at Mannheim, where she made\r\nacquaintance with an officer, who introduced a second, and a third,\r\nuntil she knew eight in all. She had the whole lot once to supper, and\r\nthey all fucked her three times each. She was a wonderfully fine woman,\r\nand could take no end of fucking. Her father had initiated her at twelve\r\nyears of age. She was of Greek origin, and actually was hairy and\r\nmenstruated at that early age. But all women are rakes in their hearts,\r\nand numbers never encumber them.\r\n\r\nDuring Harry\xe2\x80\x99s encounter with his mother, the doctor stood beside them,\r\nand handled Harry\xe2\x80\x99s ballocks and acted postillion to him. Mamma took to\r\nit most kindly. The sight again inflamed the doctor, the incestuous idea\r\nenhancing the excitement. As Harry withdrew, he begged Mrs. Dale to get\r\non her hands and knees, to let him put it in from behind. He would\r\nrather have gone in behind but did not think she was as yet quite\r\nprepared to allow that. He only said that the movement below his eyes of\r\nsuch a fine bottom as hers added to the excitement. He further proposed\r\nthat she should kneel over Harry\xe2\x80\x99s body reversed, so that she might\r\ngamahuche him, and he frig her beautiful clitoris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to kill me between you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but all the same complied.\r\nShe sucked Harry\xe2\x80\x99s prick and he spent in her mouth, which she swallowed\r\nwith great gusto, spending herself at the same moment in advance of the\r\ndoctor. Harry kept frigging her clitoris with one hand, while the other\r\nwas frigging the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-hole. It was a long bout, she made\r\nHarry spend twice in her mouth, while she spent thrice to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonce, all dying away together in the final fuck. They lay long lost to\r\neverything, and when they recovered, they separated and retired to their\r\nown rooms.\r\n\r\nThe ice being thus broken, the remaining days were passed in the most\r\nrefined lasciviousness. The doctor had his way with her bottom, and\r\nasked her leave to have Harry\xe2\x80\x99s after Harry had had his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbottom-hole, while the doctor was fucking her, and had fucked the doctor\r\nupon another occasion, the doctor crying out\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHi, hi, hi!\xe2\x80\x9d as if it hurt\r\nhim, and he was losing his maidenhead. He professed immense\r\nsatisfaction, when she let him have Harry, declaring that he could not\r\ntell whether having her both ways, having Harry, or being had himself,\r\nwas the greatest pleasure. Mamma declared that to have both apertures\r\nfilled at the same moment was the most delicious. It was then the doctor\r\nsaid he would try. So fucking mamma in a kneeling position he presented\r\nhis great backside to Harry and was well fucked. It was after this\r\ncomplete initiation that they returned home, and after such proceedings,\r\nthe transition to a general entry into our orgies was easily arranged.\r\nAs they were to arrive to a late dinner, it was resolved that Mrs. Dale\r\nshould stay the night, and we would see what that would bring forth.\r\nThey arrived accordingly. Mrs. Dale went to Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s room, taking Ellen\r\nwith her to help her at her toilet. Here ensued an explanation between\r\nthem. Mrs. Dale felt that there must be an explicit avowal on both\r\nsides. She admitted to Ellen that Harry had come to her bed, and only\r\nsucceeded in his horrible purpose by telling her how he and Ellen had\r\nseen her operations with Charlie, and had followed her example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my dear Ellen, as there must be no secrets between us, tell me\r\nif you and Charlie have got together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, we have. You know I had seen how immense he was, and yet\r\nwith what pleasure you took him in. So curiosity made me give way one\r\nday that we were in the summer house, and he slept with me afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife suspect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, she knows all about it. I forgot to bolt the door one night;\r\nin the morning Charlie made too much noise. She came in, merely in her\r\nchemise, ran up and pulled him off me, without imagining she ran any\r\nrisk herself. Charlie seized her in his arms, and swore he would do as\r\nmuch to her, to prevent her telling. She was horrified, and fled to her\r\nown room, but had not time to shut him out; he forced the door open, she\r\nran to her bed, intending to ring for the servant, he caught her as she\r\nhad one knee up on the bed, and was into her from behind before she\r\ncould accomplish her purpose. She cried out to me, to come and pull him\r\naway. I went, but told her Charlie was right, as it would prevent her\r\nsplitting upon us. I rather think that Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s large proportions gave\r\nher much pleasure, for she soon ceased to struggle, indeed she had her\r\nback to him, and his strong arms round her waist prevented her using her\r\nhands. She cried much afterwards, and talked about the greatness of the\r\ncrime. She had then got into bed. Charlie followed, to coax and console\r\nher, and, of course, got into her again. I thought she enjoyed the\r\nsecond, for her bottom heaved to meet him. She afterwards accused him of\r\nthe crime of seducing a young lady, her guest, but I stopped that, by\r\navowing that my cousin had had me previously. Then she accused me of\r\nseducing Charlie, and here, I must implore your pardon, for I let out\r\ninadvertently that you had initiated him, for I had seen you having\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you bad girl, how could you be so cruel and imprudent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear aunt, there is no great harm done. Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s aunt was soon\r\nquite appeased and regularly joined us after this. She is as fond, if\r\nnot fonder, of gamahuching me as you used to be; she has grown greedy\r\nfor Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s immense cock, envies your having had the first of him, and\r\nsays that if she had known of his wonderful proportions, she could not\r\nhave resisted initiating him herself. She hopes that, through my means,\r\nshe will become more intimate with you. I have told her of your\r\nbeautiful clitoris. She dotes on the gamahuche, and vows that she will\r\nnever be happy till she has done it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis explanation was a great relief to the widow, who knew she was all\r\nright with the doctor, and now foresaw that it would be all right with\r\nhis wife also and they would have complete freedom to indulge in the\r\nwildest lubricity. So having dressed, they descended to dinner. The\r\ndoctor had explained all their London doings to his wife, so that after\r\ndinner the three ladies exchanged confidence. Aunt was so eager to see\r\nand suck Mrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s large clitoris that they adjourned to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom, where the doctor discovered them in the midst of their\r\noperations. Mrs. Dale was stretched on her back, with extended\r\nthighs\xe2\x80\x94aunt, with her head pressed by Mrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s hands down on her\r\ncunt, was sucking at the splendid clitoris, and working some fingers in\r\nand out her cunt. They were too intent on their pleasure to notice his\r\nentrance. Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s petticoats were above her hips, as she knelt. The old\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s cock stood, he advanced, knelt down, got between her legs, and\r\nfucked her as she was, begging her to continue her lascivious operations\r\non Mrs. Dale. When he had finished, he congratulated both ladies on the\r\nintimate friendship established between them, said it was the best wish\r\nof his heart. He assured Mrs. Dale that his wife was the best woman in\r\nthe world, and never grudged him a little variety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have acknowledged my infidelity with you, and it appears my nephew\r\nhas been taking my place, in my absence. She tells me you instructed\r\nCharlie, and that he is monstrous when in erection, as big again as me,\r\nor as a certain Grenadier Captain, once a favourite of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s. I am\r\ncurious to see it. She tells me also that he has been sleeping with your\r\ncharming niece Ellen, who, I must confess, has raised in me a great\r\ndesire to possess her. Now, my dear madam, if you will consent to invite\r\nCharlie to sleep with you and Ellen, I could come in, after you have\r\neach had a turn or two out of Charlie, and take Ellen, while you would\r\nhave Charlie all to yourself. My wife won\xe2\x80\x99t object, and I hope you will\r\ngive your consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear doctor, after what has occurred between us, I can refuse\r\nyou nothing, but I think dear Harry should have some comfort. I suppose,\r\nmy dear madam, that the doctor has told you of my son surprising and\r\nviolating me. Your husband reconciled me to his caresses, and I can\r\nassure you that without the enormous size of Charlie, he has a charming\r\nway that may please any woman. From what the doctor says, you are free\r\nfrom prejudices, why should you be left out in the cold, while we are\r\nall enjoying ourselves, why should you not go to his bedroom, and see\r\nwhat he is made of. I, his mother, can strongly recommend him to your\r\nfavour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, Mrs. Dale whispered to me to come to them after the\r\ndomestics had gone to bed. I went and fucked them both three times,\r\ntwice in front and once behind, the one who was being fucked always\r\ngamahuching the other. When I began to tail off, Mrs. Dale arose,\r\nunbolted the door of communication with uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room, and invited him to\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s arms, who was very glad to have a little further experience of\r\nanother man\xe2\x80\x99s prick. Uncle gallantly gamahuched her before fucking her,\r\nthen begged to see my wonderful prick, pretended to be perfectly\r\nastonished at its monstrous dimensions, and wondered how Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\ncunt could ever have taken it in. It was a tight fit certainly, but the\r\ndear creature liked it none the worse for that. Before fucking Ellen, he\r\nbegged Mrs. Dale to let him guide my large prick into her. After\r\nenjoying our first movements, and being excited into sufficient\r\nconsistency, he proceeded to fuck dear Ellen; even he had some\r\ndifficulty in entering, notwithstanding the libations I had previously\r\npoured into her, but being once fairly hilted, he declared it was one of\r\nthe tightest little cunts it had ever been his good fortune to fuck.\r\nAfter this, we proceeded each our way, and with a longer interval,\r\nbrought matters to the exquisite conclusion, panting and throbbing for\r\nsome time afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe doctor now retired, and we arranged ourselves for repose. We were\r\nawakened in the morning by the entrance of aunt and Harry. He flew to\r\nhis mamma\xe2\x80\x99s arms, who lay down on Ellen to gamahuche her while Harry was\r\nfucking her. Aunt and I coupled in the old-fashioned way. Uncle entered\r\nwhile we were in full operation, and seeing the tempting backside of\r\nHarry, scrambled up behind and fucked his bottom. After we had done,\r\naunt pretended to be shocked at his attack on a boy\xe2\x80\x99s bottom\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas a different thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my dear, get upon Charlie the next time, and I shall fuck\r\nyour truly magnificent bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he drew Mrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the glorious proportions, not only\r\nof aunt\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, but of her body, and all her limbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is indeed glorious,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI must, my dear madam, gamahuche\r\nyou. I have not forgotten the exquisite pleasure you gave me in that\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided you give me your clitoris to\r\noccupy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, that will suit me admirably; but you must lie upon me, that\r\nI may have the pleasure of gazing on that magnificent bottom, and\r\ncaressing the immense rotundities of your buttocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, it was a glorious sight to see these two wanton lascivious women in\r\nthe full enjoyment of each other. It set us all on fire, and the moment\r\nthey had done I slaked the fire within me in the capacious but tight\r\ncunt of my aunt, while uncle fucked her bottom-hole. Mrs. Dale lay under\r\nEllen, while Harry fucked Ellen from behind, and Ellen gamahuched her\r\naunt, who herself guided her son\xe2\x80\x99s prick into Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, and tickled\r\nher clitoris, at the same time acting postillion to her son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbottom-hole.\r\n\r\nOh! it was a splendid bout\xe2\x80\x94we were all so excited and it was also the\r\nfirst meeting of us all in one orgie. We all died away in a perfect\r\nheaven of ecstasy, and lay long in the after-enjoyment. Our previous\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s work made this the last for the time, and we all separated to\r\nseek some welcome repose before breakfast time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale remained our visitor for three days, during which we met in\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom every night, and renewed our delicious orgies. Mrs.\r\nDale carried off her son and niece, and I promised to come over to her\r\ncottage on the following Saturday, when Harry and I took turn and turn\r\nabout with the two dear creatures, sometimes fucking one between us two\r\nat once. When the school resumed its work, Mrs. Dale and Ellen always\r\ndined at the rectory on Sunday and slept there, when we made a general\r\norgie in the old style.\r\n\r\nThis continued until our midsummer holidays, when I was to leave the\r\nrectory for King\xe2\x80\x99s College. Mrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s and Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancies, daily\r\nbecoming nearer to the period of parturition, were getting more\r\ndifficult to conceal. We had long discussions with uncle as to what was\r\nbest to be done. It was at last arranged that they should leave the\r\ncottage as if for a tour on the continent, but in reality should only go\r\nto Paris, and take apartments in the house of a good _accoucheuse_ in\r\nthe environs, and remain quiet there till the period of delivery. It was\r\nnot necessary for them to go before we broke up, and the doctor and\r\nHarry and I could accompany them, and after I had seen my guardian on my\r\nreturn to London, I had no doubt of getting his leave, and the necessary\r\nmeans to visit the continent up to the middle of October, when the\r\nclasses would begin. It all fell out as arranged. Nothing of the\r\npregnancy was visible, thanks to the full robes worn.\r\n\r\nWe accomplished our journey, found a capital _accoucheuse_ in a\r\nbeautiful neighbourhood, with a large garden. Harry, uncle, and aunt\r\nremained with them, while I returned to London. I saw my guardian, who,\r\nafter putting me through an examination, expressed himself much pleased\r\nwith my progress, said the visit to the continent would expand my mind,\r\nand that he would furnish me with the means. He recommended that I\r\nshould visit my mother first for a fortnight, and announced that at\r\nabout the end of that time the girls would come up to London to enter a\r\nfirst-rate finishing school. He further told me he had proposed to and\r\nhad been accepted by Miss Frankland, and they were to be married at the\r\nsame time; my sisters were to be bridesmaids, and I could be present at\r\nthe marriage before going abroad. All this being arranged, I ran down\r\nhome. My mother was delighted to see me, and thought me grown and much\r\nimproved. It is needless to say how glad my sisters and Miss Frankland\r\nwere to see me. They had had no fucking except by tongue or dildo, so\r\nyou may imagine the fury with which they set upon me the first two or\r\nthree nights. We resumed all our lascivious operations of former days.\r\nMy sisters had developed into splendid women, the youngest still the\r\nmost libidinous. Dear Miss Frankland, on my congratulating her on her\r\nintended marriage, lovingly told me that it was the prospect of being\r\nnear me that had reconciled her to it. We spent a most delicious\r\nfortnight, which passed like a day.\r\n\r\nI found an opportunity of fucking my old governess, Mrs. Vincent that\r\nwas. My son was a fine little fellow, toddling about and talking\r\nalready. His mother loved me as much as ever, and was become a finer\r\ndeveloped woman, more amorous and lecherous than she used to be. She\r\nsaid no one could be kinder or more loving than her husband, and she had\r\nnever been unfaithful to him but with me, whom, as her own formation,\r\nshe must always love, and would never refuse me anything I asked when it\r\ncould be safely done. At the sole opportunity I had I fucked her three\r\ntimes without drawing, and finished with a bottom-fuck. I may here\r\nmention that a little girl followed for nine months from that period,\r\nwhich she always assured me was mine.\r\n\r\nMy mother, the girls, and Miss Frankland all came up with me to London.\r\nThe marriage went off with _eclat_. My guardian made very handsome\r\npresents to my sisters, and gave me a gold watch, chain, and seals,\r\ntogether with a handsome cheque for my travelling expenses. He and his\r\nbride, whom I fucked just before she went to church, departed for\r\nScotland, to return by the English lakes, for their honeymoon trip. A\r\nfew days afterwards, having had two or three nights excellent fucking\r\nwith my sisters, mamma and I conducted them to their school, and left\r\nthem with tearful adieux. My mother was to remain in town for a week\r\nuntil uncle and aunt\xe2\x80\x99s return, when she intended to accompany her sister\r\nto the rectory and remain there until I returned from the continent. I\r\nwas quickly again in Paris. We took rooms near the two darlings, where\r\nuncle and aunt remained for the week they had yet to stay. We took mamma\r\nand Ellen several times to the play, and they slept with us every night.\r\nUncle and aunt left at the end of the week, but we kept on the\r\napartments for the dear women to come to us, fucking them as much as we\r\ncould. It seemed as if their pregnancy stimulated their lubricity, for\r\nwe could hardly satisfy them. We had at least always to take them on\r\nhands and knees, although neither of them ever showed much in\r\nfront\xe2\x80\x94their babes lying just between\xe2\x80\x94but, by Jove, their hips expanded\r\nsplendidly. Dear mamma measured a yard across, and her backside\r\nprojected almost as much as my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s. She loved to be fucked in her\r\nbottom-hole to the last. We actually had them both up to the night\r\nbefore the day they were each confined. Nothing could be more favourable\r\nthan their time. As I formerly stated, each had a little daughter.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day afterwards they were both able to rise, but as it would\r\nhave been very prejudicial to renew our intercourse before another three\r\nweeks had elapsed, Harry and I went off for a walking excursion in\r\nSwitzerland, which we traversed in all directions, with continual\r\ndelight at the glorious scenery. We did not touch a single woman. When\r\nvery sharp set we fucked each other, but very little even of that, so\r\nthat we renovated our constitutions and returned in robust health, ready\r\nto do justice to the charms of the two darlings, who had impatiently\r\nawaited our arrival.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to repeat the description of the delicious fucking with\r\nwhich they welcomed us. They appeared more lovely than ever, especially\r\nEllen, who had developed into womanhood. We made arrangements to leave\r\nthe two darling children in the hands of a healthy wet nurse, and set\r\nout on an expedition down the Loire to Tours, Bordeaux, and the\r\nPyrenees, returned at the end of September by Montpellier, Nismes,\r\nAvignon, and Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe two babes were in excellent health. Arrangements were made for their\r\nremaining with their foster mother for a year, and we all returned to\r\nLondon together.\r\n\r\nWe had three nights\xe2\x80\x99 delicious fucking before they returned to the\r\ncountry, and promises were made that they would come to town from time\r\nto time to renew our orgies. My mother and aunt came up to see me\r\nsettled in my lodgings, which were taken in Norfolk Street, and I was\r\nentered at King\xe2\x80\x99s College.\r\n\r\nI passed a delicious night with aunt before she left; and ran down with\r\nmy mother to see her safe home. On my return I found my guardian had\r\nreturned. I called to pay my respects to his wife. I found her alone,\r\nand we managed her first piece of adultery, which, as you may suppose,\r\nwas not the last. But as this third volume is already a long one, I\r\nshall here close it.\r\n\r\nThe fourth will introduce us to London, and renew the delicious\r\nintercourse with Mrs. Benson, as well as with my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and\r\nour dear friend MacCallum, as well as many other friends.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x94Ann\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Nichols\xe2\x80\x94The Benson, the Egerton, and the Count\xe2\x80\x94Ann, the\r\nNichols, and MacCallum\xe2\x80\x94Aunt, Uncle, Harry, the Frankland and the De\r\nGrandvits\xe2\x80\x94Carl\xe2\x80\x94The Count\xe2\x80\x94The Frankland\r\n\r\nI concluded my last volume by saying that I had taken lodgings in\r\nNorfolk Street, Strand, for the convenience of being near King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCollege. It was at the house of a Mrs. Nichols, tall, powerfully built,\r\nmasculine, but a kind and motherly looking widow of fifty-two\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nattentive and bustling landlady, looking herself to the better cooking,\r\nand having a plain cook, who was also a general servant, to help her\r\ndownstairs, and two nieces to do the waiting and attendance on her\r\nlodgers upstairs. The younger was there alone when I entered the\r\nlodgings; her elder sister had had what they called a \xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwas then in the country until she could be unburthened of it. She was\r\nexpected back in about six weeks. Meanwhile, as the winter was not the\r\nseason, I was the only lodger, and the younger had only me to attend to;\r\nher name was Jane; she was but a little thing, but very well made, good\r\nbubbies and bottom, which I soon discovered were firm and hard,\r\nprojecting fully on both sides. She was fairly good looking, but with a\r\nsingular innocent manner of freedom about her that made me imagine she\r\nhad as yet had no chance of a \xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d In a week we became\r\nintimate, and after often praising her pretty face and figure, I\r\nsnatched a kiss now and then, which at first she resented with an\r\nattractive yet innocent sort of sauciness. It was in her struggles on\r\nthese occasions that I became aware of the firm and hard bosom and\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nUp to this time my flirtations were without ulterior object, but the\r\nreality of the attractions of these hidden charms raised my lustful\r\npassions. I gradually increased my flatteries and caresses, squeezed her\r\nbubbies, when I sometimes drew her on my knee and was kissing her, and\r\nas at first she resisted my drawing her to my knee, I took occasion to\r\nlay hold of her buttocks, which I found more developed than I could have\r\nsupposed. Gradually her resistance to these little liberties ceased and\r\nshe would quietly sit on my knee and return the kiss I gave. Her dress\r\nwas a little open in front, so from feeling her bubbies outside, I\r\ngradually got to feeling their naked beauties inside. I now thought I\r\ncould attempt greater familiarities, so one day when seated on my knee\r\nwith one arm round her waist, I pressed her to my lips, and while so\r\nengaged, whipt my free arm up her petticoats, and before she had become\r\naware of the movement, had got my hand upon her mount, a very nicely\r\nhaired one. She started up to a standing position, but as I held her\r\nclose clasped round the waist she could not get away, and her new\r\nposition enabled me the easier to get my hand between her thighs and\r\nthus to feel her charming pouting little cunt. I began attempting to\r\nfrig her clitoris, but stooping she drew her cunt away, and looking at\r\nme with a droll innocent expression of alarm, and with a perfect\r\nunconsciousness of the import of her words, cried,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! take care what\r\nyou are at. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how a lodger this last summer suffered for\r\nseizing me in that way and hurting me very much. I screamed out, aunt\r\ncame up, and, do you know, he had \xc2\xa350 to pay for his impudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not but smile at the extraordinary innocence of the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not hurt you, dear Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what he said, but he went on in a most horrible way, and not\r\nonly hurt me very much, but made me bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be with his hand, you see I only gently press this soft\r\nhairy little thing. I am sure that don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! if that was all I should not mind it, it was when he pushed me\r\non the sofa, and pressed upon me, that he hurt me terribly, and you must\r\ntake care what you are about, or you, too, will have to pay \xc2\xa350.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a curious air of innocence in all this; it was evident to me\r\nthe fellow had got into her, and broken her hymen with violence, and\r\nthen her screams had prevented his finishing his work. Her manner\r\nconvinced me that she was really not aware of the consequences, or\r\nrather had not as yet really had her sexual passions aroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear Jane, I neither intend to hurt you or make myself liable\r\nto pay \xc2\xa350, but you will not refuse me the pleasure of feeling this nice\r\nlittle hairy nest, you see how gentle I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you will do me no more hurt than that I shan\xe2\x80\x99t refuse you,\r\nbecause you are a nice kind young gentleman, and very different from the\r\nother rough fellow, who never chattered with me and made me laugh as you\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94but you must not push your fingers up there, it was something he\r\npushed up there that hurt me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI withdrew my finger, and as, at my request, she had opened her thighs a\r\nlittle, I felt and caressed her very nice little cunt, and with a finger\r\npressed externally above her clitoris, I could see that she flushed and\r\nshivered on feeling me there. However, I did no more than gently press\r\nand feel all her hairy mount and fat pouting cunt; she said I must let\r\nher go, or her aunt would be coming up.\r\n\r\nThe first step was now gained. Gradually I progressed further and\r\nfurther; felt her charming bare arse as she stood before me, got her to\r\nlet me see the beautiful curls she had got on her cunt, then came to\r\nkissing it, until at last she opened her thighs and let me tongue it, to\r\nher most exquisite delight. I made her spend for the first time in her\r\nlife, and soon she came to me for it. I had gradually introduced a\r\nfinger up her cunt while licking her clitoris and exciting her so much\r\nthat she was unconscious of my doing it; then two fingers, and after she\r\nhad spent deliriously, I made them perform an imitation of a throb,\r\nwhich made her jump and ask what I was doing. I asked if she did not\r\nfeel that my fingers were inside of her sweet Fanny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so. It was there I was so hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not hurt you, dear Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear no, it makes me feel queer, but it is very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now you know that I have two fingers inside, I will use my tongue\r\nagain against your charming little clitoris, and work the fingers in and\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did so, and she soon spent in an agony of delight, pressing my head\r\ndown hard on her cunt, and crying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! it is too great a pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand then died off, half insensible. Another time I repeated this she\r\ntold me not to forget to use my fingers. Having made her spend twice I\r\ntook her on my knee, and told her that I possessed an instrument that\r\nwould give her far more pleasure than tongue or finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is it? I should so like to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo pulling out my stiff-standing prick, she stared in amazement. She had\r\nreally never seen a prick, although it was evidently a prick that had\r\ndeflowered her, for with my fingers I had explored her cunt, and found\r\nno hymen there. I put her hand upon it, she involuntarily grasped it\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis enormous thing could never get into my body, look, it is thicker\r\nthan all your fingers put together, and only two fingers feel so tight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, darling, but this dear little thing stretches, and was made to\r\nreceive this big thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was exciting her clitoris with my finger, she grew evidently\r\nlasciviously inclined, so saying, \xe2\x80\x9cJust let me try, and if it hurts you\r\nI will stop; you know I am always gentle with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are, my dear fellow, but take care not to hurt me.\xe2\x80\x9d She lay down\r\non the bed, as I desired, with feet up and knees laid open. I spat on my\r\nprick, and wetted the knob and upper shaft well, then bringing it to her\r\ncunt, well moistened by my saliva in gamahuching her, I held open the\r\nlips with the fingers of my left hand, and half buried its knob before\r\ngetting to the real entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t flinch, dearest, I shall not hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d And I got it well over the\r\nknob, and buried it one inch further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems as if it would burst me open, it so\r\nstretches me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it does not hurt you, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d I had immediately stopped before\r\nasking the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo not exactly, but I feel as if something was in my throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest a little, and that will go off.\xe2\x80\x9d I slipped a finger down on her\r\nclitoris, and as I frigged it she grew more and more excited, giving\r\ndelicious cunt pressures on my prick, it gradually made its way by the\r\ngentle pushing I continued to make without other movements. It was more\r\nthan half in when she spent, this not only lubricated the interior, but\r\nthe inner muscles relaxing, a gentle shove forward housed it to the\r\nhilt, and then I lay quiet until she recovered from the half fainting\r\nstate her last discharge had produced; soon the increased pressures of\r\nthe inner folds showed that her passions were awakening afresh. She\r\nopened her eyes and, looking lovingly, said I had given her great\r\npleasure, but she felt as if something enormous was stretching her\r\ninside to the utmost. Had I got it all in?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dearest, and now it will be able to give you greater pleasure than\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d I began a slow withdrawal and return, frigging her clitoris at\r\nthe same time, for I was standing between her legs. She soon grew wild\r\nwith excitement, nature prompting her, her arse rose and fell almost as\r\nwell as if she was mistress of the art. The novel combination of prick\r\nand finger quickly brought on the ecstatic crisis. I, too, was wild with\r\nlust, and we spent together, ending in an annihilation of all our senses\r\nby the extreme ecstasy of the final overpowering crisis. We lay panting\r\nfor some time in all the after-joys. Dear Jane begged me to give her\r\nsome water, as she felt quite faint. I withdrew, still almost in a\r\nstanding state, got her some water, helped her up, seated her on the\r\nsofa and kissed her lovingly as I thanked her for the exquisite joy she\r\nhad given me. She threw her arms round my neck, and with tears in her\r\neyes told me I had taught her the joys of heaven, and she should always\r\nlove me, and I must always love her, for now she could not live without\r\nme. I kissed and dried her eyes, and told her we should in future enjoy\r\nit even more when she got accustomed to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see the dear thing that gave me such pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pulled it out, but it was no longer at the stand; and this surprised\r\nher. I explained the necessity of its being so, but said she would\r\nquickly see it rise and swell to the former size if she continued to\r\nhandle it so nicely. It rose almost before I could say as much. She\r\nfondled it, and even stooped and kissed its ruby head. We should quickly\r\nhave got to another bout of fucking if the ringing of the call bell had\r\nnot brought us to a sense of its imprudence; so after arranging her hair\r\nand dress, she hastily descended with some of the breakfast things.\r\n\r\nOf course, so good a beginning led to constant renewals and Jane quickly\r\nbecame extremely amorous, and under my instruction a first-rate fucker.\r\n\r\nAs all my dear friends were not in London, I was fortunate in having\r\nsuch a _bonne bouche_ to comfort me. My sisters passed every Sunday with\r\nme, and both got some good fucking out of me in every way, without\r\nraising any suspicions in the house.\r\n\r\nA month after I had taken up my residence at Mrs. Nichols\xe2\x80\x99s, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister arrived. She was a much finer woman than Jane, broad shouldered,\r\nwide-spread bosom, which, in after-days, I found had not suffered by her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d but then she had not suckled it. Her hips were widely\r\nprojected, and she was grand and magnificent in her arse. Naturally of a\r\nvery hot temperament, when once she had tasted the magnificent weapon I\r\nwas possessed of, she grew most lasciviously lustful, and was one of the\r\nbest fuckers I ever met with. Her power of nip almost equalled by\r\nbeloved aunt\xe2\x80\x99s. Jane was fair, Ann was dark, with black locks and black\r\nhairy cunt\xe2\x80\x94a very long cunt, with a small tight hole in it, and above it\r\na wide-spread projecting mount, splendidly furnished with hair. Her\r\nclitoris was hard and thick, but with little projection. She also became\r\nmadly fond of arse-fucking, and particularly liked me to spend therein.\r\nThis was partly to prevent any consequences leading to a second\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn her first arrival Jane was much afraid she would discover our\r\nconnection and we took every precaution, although I, in my heart, wished\r\nthis might occur, for as she occasionally waited on me, I grew lecherous\r\nupon one whose charms, even covered, excited me greatly. I always\r\nflattered and praised her magnificence of figure whenever she came alone\r\nto me, but as Jane generally was running in and out, I did not attempt\r\nfurther action. One morning I overheard Mrs. Nichols tell Jane to put on\r\nher bonnet and go to Oxford Street on some errand; I knew thus that Ann\r\nwould attend on me, and there would be no chance of interruption from\r\nJane, so I determined to come at once to the point. We had become on\r\nfriendly, chatty terms, and when she had laid breakfast I asked her to\r\nhelp me on with my coat, which done, I thanked her and with one arm\r\nround her waist drew her to me and kissed her. \xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nis something new,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not attempt to withdraw, so giving her\r\nanother kiss, I told her what a glorious woman she was, and how she\r\nexcited me\xe2\x80\x94just see. I held one of her hands, and before she was aware,\r\nplaced it on my huge prick, that bulged out of my trousers as if it\r\nwould burst its way through.\r\n\r\nShe could not help squeezing it, while she cried\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, gracious!\r\nwhat an enormous thing you have got!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face flushed, her eyes sparkled with the fire of lust that stirred\r\nher whole soul. She tried to grasp it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will put it in its natural state into your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo pulling it out, she seized it at once, and most lasciviously gazed\r\nupon it, pressing it gently. She evidently was growing lewder and\r\nlewder, so I at once proposed to fuck her, and thinking it best to be\r\nfrank, and put her at her ease, I told her that I knew she had had a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d but if she would let me fuck her I should be on honour to\r\nwithdraw before spending, and thus avoid all chance of putting her belly\r\nup.\r\n\r\nShe had become so randy that she felt, as she afterwards told me, she\r\ncould not refuse so splendid a prick of a size she had often dreamt of,\r\nand longed for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I trust you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafely, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you may have me\xe2\x80\x94let me embrace that dear object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStooping, she kissed it most voluptuously, shivering at the same time in\r\nthe ecstasy of a spend produced by the mere sight and touch. She gave\r\none or two \xe2\x80\x9coh\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and drawing me to the bed by my prick, threw herself\r\nback, pulling her petticoats up at the same time. Then I beheld her\r\nsplendid cunt in all its magnificence of size and hairiness. I sank on\r\nmy knees and glued my lips to the oozing entrance, for she was one who\r\nspent most profusely, her cunt had the true delicious odour, and her\r\nspunk was thick and glutinous for a woman.\r\n\r\nI tongued her clitoris, driving her voluptuously wild. So she cried\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! do put that glorious prick into me, but remember your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI brought it up to that wide-spread, large-lipped, and immense cunt. I\r\nfully expected that big as I was I should slip in over head and\r\nshoulders with the greatest ease. So you may imagine my surprise to find\r\nthe tightest and smallest of entrances to the inner vagina I almost ever\r\nmet with, it was really with greater difficulty I effected an entrance\r\nthan I had with her little sister, whose cunt presented no such\r\nvoluptuous grandeur. It was as tight a fit as Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s was to me on our\r\nfirst coition. Tight as it was, it gave her nothing but the most\r\nexquisite pleasure, she was thoroughly up to her work, and was really\r\none of the most voluptuous and lascivious fuckers I have ever met with,\r\nexcellent as my experience has been. I made her, with fucking and\r\nfrigging, spend six times before I suddenly withdrew my prick, and\r\npressing its shaft against her wet lips, and my own belly, spent\r\ndeliciously outside. Shortly after it rose again, and this time after\r\nmaking her spend as often as before, for she was most voluptuously\r\nlustful, when I withdrew, she suddenly got from under me, and seizing\r\nits shaft with one hand, stooped and took its knob between her lips, and\r\nquickly made me pour a flood of sperm into her mouth, which she eagerly\r\nswallowed and sucked on to my great delight.\r\n\r\nWe should have had a third bout but for the necessity of her going down\r\nto her aunt.\r\n\r\nI breakfasted, then rang to take away. Again we had a delicious fuck,\r\nand a third when she came to make the bed and empty the slops. This\r\nthird time I begged her to kneel on the sofa, and let me see her\r\ngloriously grand arse, and when I had to retire I would show her a way\r\nthat would continue both our pleasure. So after fucking her from behind,\r\nand making her spend far oftener than me, I withdrew, and pushing it up\r\nbetween the lips over the clitoris, with my hand round her waist, I\r\npressed it tightly against her cunt and clitoris, and continued to\r\nwriggle my arse, made her spend again as I poured a flood all up over\r\nher belly. She declared it was almost as good as if inside.\r\n\r\nAfter this very shortly I proposed to push its nose into her\r\nbottom-hole, and just spend within.\r\n\r\nWith reluctance at first, it ended in her not only liking the point\r\nthere, but deliciously enjoying my whole prick within, and eventually it\r\nwas always the receptacle of a first discharge induced by fucking, and a\r\nsecond fuck completely carried on in that more secret altar of lust. She\r\nbecame a first-rate _enculeuse_.\r\n\r\nIt soon happened that both sisters knew of the other enjoying me, and it\r\nended in their slipping down from their attic, where both slept in the\r\nsame bed, to my room, and we had most delicious fucking and double\r\ngamahuching.\r\n\r\nAnn was by far the finest and the most lascivious fuck, but little Jane\r\nhad a certain charm of youth and also of freshness, which got her a fair\r\nshare of my favours.\r\n\r\nWe carried this on for several weeks until use made us careless and\r\nnoisy.\r\n\r\nThe aunt, when no lodgers occupied the room, slept overhead, and,\r\nprobably being sleepless one morning, when it was early daylight, heard\r\nour voices, came down and surprised me in the very act of fucking Ann\r\nand gamahuching Jane, who stood above her and presented her cunt to my\r\nlecherous tongue. A loud exclamation from their aunt roused us up at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet to bed, you dreadful hussies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey fled without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nichols then began to remonstrate with me on the infamy of my\r\nconduct. I approached the door apparently to get my shirt, for I was\r\nstark naked, but in fact to shut and lock my door, and then to turn on\r\nMrs. Nichols, who apparently had quite forgotten she had only her short\r\nshift on, which not only allowed the full display of very fine, firm,\r\nand ample bubbies, but not falling below the middle of her thighs,\r\nshowed remarkably well made legs and small knees, with the swelling of\r\nimmense thighs just indicated.\r\n\r\nMy stiff-standing prick in full vigour, and if anything, still more\r\nstimulated by the unexpected beauties shown by Mrs. Nichols, I turned\r\nupon her and seizing her round the waist from behind, pushed her\r\nforward, and before she could recover herself I had hauled up her \xe2\x80\x9ccutty\r\nsark,\xe2\x80\x9d seen a most magnificent arse, and into her cunt\xe2\x80\x94not without\r\nsomewhat painful violence, before she could recover from the surprise of\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\nShe screamed out murder, but there was no one who could hear but the\r\ngirls, and they knew better than to interrupt me. I kept fucking away in\r\nspite of cries, and passing an arm round her body, with my finger I got\r\nto her clitoris, which sprang out into considerable proportions. My big\r\nprick and the frigging of her clitoris produced their natural result. In\r\nspite of herself she grew full of lust. I felt her cunt pressures, and\r\nknew how her passions were rising. Speedily, in place of resisting, she\r\nbegan to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh,\xe2\x80\x9d and breathe hard, and then most gloriously\r\nwriggled her splendid arse, and as I spent she too was taken in the\r\ndelicious ecstasy of the final crisis. She lay throbbing on my delighted\r\nprick until it stood as stiff as before. I began a slow movement, she\r\nmade no resistance, except crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear, oh! dear,\xe2\x80\x9d as if in\r\nspite of regrets, she could not help enjoying it; indeed, at last she\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what a man you are, Mr. Roberts; it is very wrong of you to do\r\nthis, but I cannot resist enjoying it myself. It is years since I did\r\nsuch a thing, but as you have done it, it makes me wish you should do it\r\nagain. Let us change position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, but you must throw off this tiresome chemise, or I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwithdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs her lust was so excited, she made no objection, so withdrawing we\r\nstood up; she drew her shift over her head, and displayed a far more\r\nsplendid form, with an exquisitely fair and dimpled skin, than I could\r\nhave thought possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mrs. Nichols, what a fine perfect form you have got, let me\r\nembrace you in my arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was nothing loath, flattered by my praise. She laid hold of my cock\r\nwith one hand, and closely clasped me with the other arm, while I threw\r\nan arm and hand round on her truly magnificent arse, and with my other\r\nhand pressed on a wonderful pair of bubbies as hard and firm as any maid\r\nof eighteen. Our mouths met in a loving kiss, our tongues exchanged\r\nendearments. She said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made me very wicked, let me have this enormous and dear fellow\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I must first gaze on all her beauties, especially on her gorgeous\r\nand enormous bottom. She turned herself round in every way, delighted to\r\nfind that I so ardently admired her.\r\n\r\nShe then lay down on her back, and spread wide her legs, and called to\r\nme to mount and put it in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I must kiss this beautiful cunt, and suck this superb clitoris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mount was covered with closely curled brown silky locks; her cunt\r\nwas large with grand thick lips and well-haired sides. Her clitoris\r\nstood out quite three inches, red and stiff. I took it in my mouth,\r\nsucked it, and frigged her cunt with two fingers, which went in with the\r\ngreatest ease, but were nipped tightly the moment the entrance was\r\ngained, and I frigged and sucked until she spent madly with absolute\r\nscreams of delight. I continued to suck and excite her, which quickly\r\nmade her cry out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, darling boy, come and shove your glorious prick into my longing\r\ncunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sprang up and buried him until our two hairs were crushed between us.\r\nShe held me tight for a minute without moving, then went off like a wild\r\n_Bacchante_, and uttered voluptuous bawdy expressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShove your delicious prick further and harder. Oh, you are killing me\r\nwith delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a perfect mistress of the art, gave me exquisite pleasure, and,\r\nI may add, proved afterwards a woman of infinite variety, and became one\r\nof my most devoted admirers. Our intrigue continued for years, while her\r\nage, as is the case with good wine, only appeared to improve her. Her\r\nhusband was not a bad fucker, but having only a small prick, had never\r\nstimulated her lust as my big splitter had done.\r\n\r\nWe had on this first occasion three other good fucks, which she seemed\r\nto enjoy more and more.\r\n\r\nAs I had previously fucked the girls pretty well, my prick at last\r\nrefused to rise and perform. We had to stop fucking, but I gamahuched\r\nher once more after again posing her, and admiring her really\r\nwonderfully well made and well-preserved body. She had a good suck at my\r\ncock, without bringing him up again.\r\n\r\nAt last we separated, but not before she made a promise that she would\r\nsleep with me that night, and a glorious night we had. I had the more\r\ndifficult task of reconciling her to my having her nieces. I used to\r\nhave them one night, and sleep with her the next.\r\n\r\nAnn, as I have said, was one of the lewdest and most lascivious women I\r\nhad ever known. I had told them of the beauty of their aunt\xe2\x80\x99s whole\r\nperson, and of her wonderful clitoris, and how she liked me to gamahuche\r\nit. This awakened the tribadic passions of Ann to gamahuche her aunt.\r\n\r\nI, at last, persuaded her to let Ann join us, and both were afterwards\r\nextremely glad I had done so, for both were thorough tribades, and\r\nlasciviously enjoyed each other, while being fucked by me in turns. Mrs.\r\nNichols too, once she got used to arse-fucking, delighted in it, and we\r\nhad the wildest orgies together.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my very dear friend MacCallum had returned to town. He lived\r\nin the outskirts, but had taken a small set of chambers at Lyon\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, a\r\nsitting room and bedroom, where he had a complete library of bawdy books\r\nand pictures to excite to new efforts passions palled with excess. It\r\nwas here I took my sisters, and every Sunday we four, stripped to the\r\nbuff, indulged in every excess the wildest lust could prompt.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, uncle, aunt, the Dales, and Ellen all came to town, and\r\ntaking the same rooms with others that uncle and Mrs. Dale and her son\r\nhad formerly down in Norfolk Street, we had the most glorious orgies.\r\n\r\nI confessed that I had debauched my sisters during the weary months I\r\nhad been left alone with them, and advised their initiation into our\r\nsociety. Uncle greedily snatched at the idea, so did aunt and Harry\r\nDale, but his mother and Ellen rather discouraged it. However, the\r\nmajority had it, and aunt went to the school, and took them away for the\r\nholidays. I had instructed them to keep up the idea of a late initiation\r\nby me, and how much they liked it when done, carefully avoiding the\r\nleast reference to former freedoms.\r\n\r\nThey afforded a very effective aid to the wild variety of our orgies.\r\nUncle especially affected them, and was never tired of fucking, sucking\r\nor gamahuching their splendid charms. Aunt, whose lech was for fresh\r\nyoung women, was unbounded in her admiration and tribadic use of their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nI made a confident of Harry Dale about our re-unions at MacCallum\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand, with the latter\xe2\x80\x99s leave, introduced him to our orgies in the Inn.\r\n\r\nMacCallum took greatly to the fine tight arse of young Dale. He also\r\nwished to have Ellen introduced. I took occasion to break the matter to\r\nher, and in the end she made a delicious addition to those private\r\norgies. In March Mrs. Benson, Mrs. Egerton, and husbands came up to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nI had written to the Benson, and got a note from her the moment she\r\narrived. I called immediately, and finding her alone, her husband having\r\ngone to the city, was received with delight. After flying into each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, nature was too fierce for any amorous preliminaries. A\r\nsofa received our ardent bodies, and before one could think, legs were\r\nopened, cunt invaded, and a most rapid fuck, too rapid for luxury, was\r\nrun off. Then while recovering from our first delirium of pleasure, we\r\nhad time for a few words of mutual praise and admiration of improvements\r\nin both; but it was not until I had fucked her four times, and made her\r\nspend at least twice as often, that we found time to enter into close\r\nconverse upon past events.\r\n\r\nI had known by letter of the intrigue with the Count, Mrs. Egerton, and\r\nherself, and now heard, from her own mouth, more exciting details. She\r\ntold me how Mrs. Egerton was eager to possess my unusually great prick,\r\nadding\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, she must be alone at this hour. Come along, we may have\r\nsome fun today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not seen Mrs. Egerton for many years, in fact, for long before I\r\nhad fucked Mrs. Benson. We went. Her reception was all I could wish.\r\n\r\nMrs. Benson told us to lose no time, but to run off at least an\r\nintroductory embrace when the field was so clear. Mrs. Egerton made no\r\nobjection; the Benson acted mistress of the ceremonies, pulled out my\r\nprick and lifted the Egerton\xe2\x80\x99s petticoats, turning both sides to view,\r\nand making the Egerton handle and admire the nobleness of my prick, then\r\ntelling her to kneel and present her fat arse to my lustful gaze, guided\r\nmy longing prick into her really delicious cunt; and a most excellent\r\nfuck we had, which, as Mrs. Benson said, would put us at our ease in an\r\ninterview she had planned for next day, in which the Count was to join\r\nus, and telling me I should have to show my mettle to rival the Count.\r\n\r\nWe met next day at a quiet house in Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road.\r\nThe ladies had gone to the Soho Bazaar, leaving their carriage in Soho\r\nSquare, going out by another entrance in a back street, and driving up\r\nin a cab to us in Percy Street.\r\n\r\nAt an evening call I had made, to be introduced to Mr. Egerton, I had\r\nmet and been introduced to the Count. We had walked home as far as his\r\napartments, in Berners Street, and arranged to meet in Percy Street,\r\nbefore the arrival of our beautiful and dear friends. Thus we were\r\nimpatiently awaiting their coming when they arrived.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say no sooner had they entered, and the mere embrace\r\nand kiss of welcome been given, than they retired to another room,\r\nopening into the one where we were, to take off all encumbrances to the\r\nwildest lust, while we, too, disencumbered ourselves of all our clothes.\r\nWe were quicker than they were, and the Count was in the act of handling\r\nand admiring the grandeur of my prick when the two beautiful creatures\r\nentered in nature\xe2\x80\x99s only robe, and well might we exclaim\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman, when unadorned is adorned the most,\xe2\x80\x9d for two more beautiful\r\nwomen or more perfectly lovely in shape could hardly be seen. Women,\r\ntoo, as voluptuous and lascivious in their passions as any of their sex\r\ncould be, and it was now our delight to enjoy and satisfy their ardent\r\nlust by fucking them in every way, as well as for the first time giving\r\nthem the joy of having two real pricks in them at once. The charming\r\nBenson, as my original initiator in love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries, claimed my first\r\nembrace, the Count fucking Mrs. Egerton. We were so placed that each\r\ncould see the other, and thus enjoy the excitement of the scene. The\r\ndear creatures spent thrice to our once.\r\n\r\nThen the Egerton claimed me while the Count refilled the cunt I had just\r\nquitted.\r\n\r\nAgain we made them spend thrice to our once. They preferred these\r\npreliminary encounters to the more lascivious excesses we were about to\r\nenter upon as exciting and preparing their passions for more voluptuous\r\nembraces.\r\n\r\nBoth the dear creatures loved a prick _in culo_ from time to time, but\r\nas yet they had not had the opportunity of having a prick in each\r\naperture at once.\r\n\r\nThe Egerton, to whom my prick was as yet a novelty, said she must have\r\nit in her cunt while the Count planted his lesser but very fine prick in\r\nher arse.\r\n\r\nThe Count\xe2\x80\x99s prick was quite as long, or nearly so, as mine, and even\r\nthicker close to the roots, but tapered up to a small pointed knob, so\r\nthat for the _enculage_ he had greater facility, than my huge-knobbed\r\naffair, whose head was as thick as any part of it. This difference of\r\nformation made the dear creatures both prefer my prick in front while\r\nthe Count attacked them in the rear. They generally each got two, with\r\nme below and the Count above. But, although it was at first somewhat\r\npainful when my huge prick took the rearward side with the Count in\r\nfront, they soon got accustomed to it, although invariably beginning,\r\nafter our preliminary fucking, with the Count first _in culo_.\r\n\r\nThe Egerton, as I said before, made her first trial of two pricks\r\nfucking her at once, by having me below her. I had laid down on my back,\r\nshe straddled over me, the Benson claimed the place of conductress to\r\nthe instruments of pleasure, and, first giving a suck to my prick, she\r\nguided it into the delicious cunt of her friend, who sank down upon my\r\nstiff-standing prick, deliciously impaling herself thereon, and went off\r\nin a voluptuous discharge on feeling its huge head engulphed to the\r\nutmost; she rose and fell upon it in an upright position, until she had\r\nspent a second time, and had brought up her passion to the wildest rage\r\nof lust, then falling into my longing arms, she called out to the Count\r\nto shove his prick at once into her arse.\r\n\r\nThe Benson had, meanwhile, sucked and moistened the Count\xe2\x80\x99s fine prick,\r\nmaking him as eager as the Egerton to be into her beautiful arsehole.\r\nThe Benson conducted it to the divine entrance of that rapture-giving\r\nreceptacle, which he entered at first with little difficulty, but as the\r\nthickening of his prick by its further entrance began to stretch the\r\ntender folds between our two pricks, the Egerton cried out for a\r\nmomentary pause, as it was producing the strange sensation that one\r\nprick alone produces in the earlier stage of sodomitic embraces.\r\n\r\nThe Benson came to her aid by desiring the Count to withdraw about half\r\nthe distance he had gained and having whipt up some warm soapsuds she\r\nwell wetted his lower shaft and then he more easily recovered lost\r\nground, and gained a complete lodgement within the tremendously\r\nstretched affair, for as I have said, the lower part of his shaft was\r\nthicker than I could grasp.\r\n\r\nThe Egerton felt as if the two apertures were about to be torn into one,\r\nand cried out for a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 cessation.\r\n\r\nWe both lay still, beyond the involuntary throbbing of our pricks,\r\npressed as they were against each other, for the at-all-times-thin\r\nmembrane dividing cunt from arsehole was now stretched to the fineness\r\nof gold leaf, and to our sensations did not appear to exist at all.\r\n\r\nThese double throbbings soon stirred up all the wild lubricity of the\r\nEgerton\xe2\x80\x99s nature, first showing itself in the responsive inward\r\npressures of the delicate widely stretched folds of both receptacles,\r\nthen increasing in fiery lust, she cried out for us to begin gently our\r\nfirst movements. We drew in and out in unison together, at first slowly,\r\nbut the Egerton finding that we were producing the most excessive\r\ndelight to her double-gorged receptacles, cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! It is heavenly; fuck faster, you angelic fuckers. I\xe2\x80\x94Oh! faster,\r\nfaster. Oh! oh! it is too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spent in such an agony of ecstasy as to faint clean away.\r\n\r\nWe were not aware of this, not having ourselves spent as we had only\r\npaused to let her enjoy her most heavenly discharge to the utmost. Then,\r\nfirst with throbs, and then with in and outward movements, we soon\r\nrecovered her from her trance of excessive joy. Her passions were more\r\nviolently stirred than before. She wriggled her arse convulsively\r\nsideways, she raved in the grossest bawdy terms, and so excited us that\r\nwe all three came to the final crisis in wild cries of the grossest\r\nlust, and died away in an agony of bliss, so overpowering that we lay,\r\nalmost insensible, soaking in the sacred vases in which were compressed\r\nour well-satisfied pricks. Meanwhile the Benson, wildly excited by the\r\nscene enacted below her eyes, sought relief by kneeling beyond my head,\r\nfor we always fucked on the floor with mattresses spread widely around;\r\nshe then backed her splendid arse over my head, and brought her cunt to\r\nmy mouth, and I had gamahuched her continuously until my own delicious\r\nspending annihilated all power of movement for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe Egerton, in the agony of her pleasure at the moment of the last\r\nspend, had fastened her teeth on the glorious arse of the Benson before\r\nher, and bit so hard as actually to draw blood and make the Benson\r\nspring forward with a sudden start and cry. But we were all too lost in\r\nthe ecstatic joys to even hear the cry of pain she uttered.\r\n\r\nAt last the Egerton gave signs of returning life. The Benson had risen\r\nand was eager for her turn, but Mrs. Egerton implored that she might\r\nhave once again a taste of these more than heavenly joys while both\r\npricks were still engulfed within her and thus avoid the pain of\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nThis was so reasonable that the Benson yielded with a good grace.\r\n\r\nThe Count, to indemnify her, begged her to stride over our two bodies,\r\nso as to bring her delicious cunt to his mouth, which, as he was\r\nkneeling, was just at the proper level; so he gamahuched, and embracing\r\nher splendid arse, postillioned her at the same time; thus we were a\r\nchain of delight.\r\n\r\nThis bout was drawn out to great length.\r\n\r\nThe Egerton must have spent half-a-dozen times, and when we both at last\r\njammed our pricks up in the ferocity of lust, making all three give down\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s essence in an almost killing ecstasy, she really fainted quite\r\naway, and so alarmed us that we withdrew to use such remedies as were at\r\nhand to bring her to; even then she was quite hysterical. We laid her in\r\nthe bed; she was relieved by a copious flood of tears, which she assured\r\nus were those of joy at the exquisite and overpowering delights we had\r\nconferred upon her. She begged us now to gratify the Benson with the\r\nsame ecstatic joys we had bestowed upon her, and she would be a quiet,\r\nand delighted spectator of our doings.\r\n\r\nIt was now my own loved Mrs. Benson\xe2\x80\x99s turn to experience the\r\ninexpressible delights of the double junction. From her love of my\r\nsplendid splitter, of which she had taken the first sweets, and which\r\nhad been initiated in her deliciously adulterous cunt into the divine\r\nmysteries of love, and the still more sacred and secret joys of the\r\nsecond altar dedicated to the worship of Priapean unutterably sensual\r\nraptures; from this circumstance and the constant use of the rear\r\nreceptacle practised by her husband, whose prick was a very fine one,\r\nthe initiation into the _double jouissance_ was less nervously effected\r\nthan with the less used arsehole of the more delicate Egerton, but at\r\nthe same time two such pricks operating at once made her wince a little\r\nbefore we were fairly engulphed to the cods, the banging together of\r\nwhich in their close proximity added greatly to the stimulating of our\r\nlust.\r\n\r\nThe sweet Benson lent herself most readily to the work, and seconded us\r\nby her art in wriggling her arse and the delicious cunt and sphincter\r\npressures; enjoying herself at once and more rapidly than the Egerton,\r\nshe got four delicious discharges before our somewhat more sluggish\r\nsenses would allow us to come to the grand final crisis, which seemed to\r\nstimulate the divine Benson to a point of raving lust, which showed\r\nitself in cries of the grossest bawdy; shouting to us to shove our\r\npricks in further and faster, calling us all the loudest blackguard\r\nnames she could put her tongue to\xe2\x80\x94absolutely roaring as the final\r\ndischarge seized her in the very same instant that we poured floods of\r\nsperm into both interiors, she then sank, annihilated by the excess of\r\nthe voluptuous delights conferred upon her, but lay throbbing and\r\npulsating in all the after-joys of the utmost venereal satisfaction. We\r\nlay long in this delicious inanition of such voluptuous excesses.\r\n\r\nThe darling Benson exercised her delicious \xe2\x80\x9cnippers\xe2\x80\x9d in both orifices,\r\nwhich soon had their expected effect, and shortly the flesh gave\r\nsymptoms of its \xe2\x80\x9cresurrection\xe2\x80\x9d to mundane joys, after having passed\r\nthrough the heavenly delights of Paradise, truly rising from the most\r\ndelicious graves in which they were lying so exquisitely buried. Like\r\nher lovely predecessor she was eager for more, and if it were possible\r\nour second course was superior to the first, at all events it was longer\r\ndrawn out, for the previous draughts on our slackening appendages made\r\nthe further delivery an effort requiring longer pumping, and thus\r\nswelled the amount of pleasure by lengthening the process before\r\narriving at the grand final crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Benson, much more ungovernable in her passion than we were, must\r\nhave spent six or seven times in our last effort, and died away in, if\r\nanything, greater abandon than in our first course, and eventually sank\r\ncompletely overcome by the entire satisfaction of her raging lust for\r\nthe time being. We, too, both wanted a respite, so we all rose.\r\n\r\nThe two dear creatures when once on their legs found instant necessity\r\nto evacuate their rear receptacles of the double cargo taken in, and\r\ndisappeared for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWe all purified ourselves and well laved everything with ice cold water\r\nto reanimate them the sooner. We then sat down to a stimulating\r\nrefreshment, in which we at least all drank a bottle of Champagne\r\napiece, in the midst of delightful and exciting bawdy wit and obscene\r\nstories, in which our darling _fouteuses_ showed a witty proficiency.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour we began to take up our positions. It was my turn to\r\ntake them in the rear, but both begged off for that day. The pause for\r\nrefreshment had given time to make them feel sore after the great\r\nstretching they had undergone for the first time, so my turn was delayed\r\nfor three days, that being the usual delay in their orgies to prevent\r\nsuspicion by too frequent absences, but not excluding any opportunity\r\nthat might occur for a rack-off in the mean time. So we only each fucked\r\nthem once and closed our exquisite orgy for that day; parting with every\r\nexpression of fully satisfied desires, and the warmest kisses and\r\nembraces.\r\n\r\nThe Count and I walked to his apartments to refresh ourselves there with\r\nhot tumblers of toddy; whiskey being a great favourite of his, and, in\r\nhis opinion, the best restorative after our exhausting efforts with the\r\ntwo insatiable creatures.\r\n\r\nHe congratulated himself on my accession to these orgies, as being a\r\ngreat relief to the burden he had had in satisfying both in both ways\r\nwhen all alone with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Count was an indefatigable and an unwearied fucker, but two\r\nsuch insatiable cunts often had tried his powers to the utmost, and was\r\nmore than he liked to do at the interview, so he had found whiskey toddy\r\na remedy at once efficacious and agreeable. I myself with my private\r\nexcesses at home was glad to know so pleasant a restorative. The Count\r\nand I became the most intimate and attached friends; through him I\r\nperfected myself in Italian, and not many years after this, passed some\r\nhappy months with him in Italy after he had been amnestied, returned to\r\nhis country and recovered part of his once large property, but of that\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nI called next day on my adored Benson, who had developed into a glorious\r\nwoman, more lovely and lustful than ever.\r\n\r\nWe had but a moment to ourselves, and could not use it for amatory\r\npurposes but as we both had much to relate we agreed to meet at our\r\nhouse in Percy Street the next day.\r\n\r\nThis house was taken furnished for love purposes only, and merely an old\r\nwoman was kept to take care of and arrange matters when we were gone; it\r\nwas held in the Count\xe2\x80\x99s name but paid for by the two fair users of it.\r\nThey had latch keys each, and the place was kept ready for everyday use.\r\n\r\nThe dear libidinous Benson avowed that she used it for other lovers\r\nunknown to the Count or the Egerton; paying the old woman liberally, she\r\nhad all her own way.\r\n\r\nWe met there the next day, rushing into each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and then\r\nassisting in the undressing we had three exquisite fucks, during which\r\nthe delighted Benson spent seven times, and then we could have a long\r\nand uninterrupted talk over old times, and my after-doings. I told her\r\nall, and how the Vincent, my elder sister, Miss Frankland, my aunt, and\r\nMrs. Dale had all thought me an innocent, receiving his first lesson in\r\ntheir delicious cunts, and how true and wise had been her sage counsels.\r\nShe listened in wonder and delight, drew from me descriptive pictures of\r\nour conjunctions and thrice interrupted my narrative to have a delicious\r\nfuck to calm the excitement raised by the lascivious descriptions of my\r\nacts with all those most glorious women. I told her also of my intrigue\r\nat my lodgings with the two sisters and the Count.\r\n\r\nMy description of the latter set her off in raging lust, and produced\r\nanother most excellent fuck. But afterwards she told me I must find\r\nother quarters in some place where Mrs. Egerton and she, or either of\r\nthem, could call and receive comfort without observation.\r\n\r\nI told her I was inscribed for chambers in the Inner Temple, which I had\r\nreason to believe I should get in a week or two. This much pleased her,\r\nand it will be seen that I succeeded in getting just such a set as\r\nexactly suited the great object in view, approachable without being\r\nunder the observation of others; commodious and agreeable, where all\r\nthat the dear Benson wished to be added to our set were brought\r\ntogether, and the wildest orgies of the most insatiable lust were\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nMy description of my aunt, of Mrs. Dale, and especially of Miss\r\nFrankland, now Mrs. Nixon, excited all the tribadic passions for which\r\nthe dear Benson was so famous.\r\n\r\nHer clitoris, which was formerly prominent, was more so now, and she\r\ndearly loved to gamahuche her own sex. In that way she took a great\r\nfancy to my sisters, especially Eliza, who had all the same instincts\r\nvery decidedly pronounced. So we had the prospect of the most consummate\r\norgies in near view, and most gloriously in the end we realised our\r\nwildest expectations.\r\n\r\nIn men we were more restricted; the Count would only consent to have\r\nHarry Dale and my uncle in any orgy of which he formed part. He was\r\nnervously timid about his sodomistic tendencies being known to many, and\r\nonly yielded on account of the relationship and the closer ties of Harry\r\nDale and myself, who eventually shared my chambers, and we lived\r\ntogether, so that perforce he was obliged to put up with his presence.\r\n\r\nHe soon came to delight in having Harry\xe2\x80\x99s prick in his bottom when\r\nfucking others at our orgies. It will thus be seen that the Count\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntimid exclusiveness shut out from these family orgies my dear and\r\nesteemed friend and master MacCallum More. However, in a certain sense,\r\nit was an advantage, as we had at least the pick of the young ones, in\r\nmy two sisters and Ellen, who wanted very little persuasion to join our\r\nLyon\xe2\x80\x99s Inn orgies. And our excellent friend had some of his own set,\r\nboth male and female, to meet us either with one, two or all, for we\r\ncould not always manage to have the whole of the dear creatures\r\ntogether. _En revanche_, dear MacCallum had several youthful ganymedes,\r\nwhose tight young bottom-holes were a great solace when cunts were\r\naltogether absent.\r\n\r\nWe thus had two distinct and separate sets of orgies, which had all the\r\nnatural effect of novelty, and by exciting comparison, making us turn\r\nfrom one to the other with renewed passions and power of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAs my sisters could only come on Sundays, that was our exclusive day,\r\nand we made an entire day of it, but I, in the end, persuaded Ann to\r\njoin our orgies with MacCallum, and she proved a first-rate addition in\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that she was of a most libidinous temperament, and\r\ndeveloped into one of the most lascivious and lustful of women one could\r\npossibly find, and as she had rare beauties and splendour of form, she\r\nwas made to raise the most raging lust in man or woman, for she, too,\r\nwas as fond of tribadic indulgencies as my aunt or the delicious\r\nFrankland. Her position as a servant prevented our introducing her to\r\nEllen or my sisters. As a matter of worldly prudency it was best not to\r\ntrust her with the knowledge of their complying with all our lustful\r\ndemands on their charming persons.\r\n\r\nThe Count, myself, and our two charming lovers met on the appointed day\r\nto renew our delicious orgies. After both of us had fucked each dear\r\ncreature came the _double jouissance_.\r\n\r\nWe took the adorable Benson first, that the scene of our erotic sports\r\nmight stir the lust of the darling Egerton to a greater heat. It was my\r\nturn to lay my offering on the secret altar of Priapus, while the Count\r\nfilled her cunt with delight.\r\n\r\nAs I have before said, the arsehole of the Benson was much more used\r\nthan that of the Egerton, whose husband never dreamt of such a horror,\r\nas she would call it. Mr. Benson, on the contrary, delighted in it, and\r\nseldom passed a night without paying his devoirs to that delicious\r\naperture. So, although it was but the second time she had indulged in\r\nthe _double jouissance_, yet her lust enabled her to take in with\r\ngreater ease my big prick in her arsehole, with the Count\xe2\x80\x99s fine prick\r\nin front, than when our parts were reversed. She revelled in the wild\r\nfury of raging lust, created by the glorious ecstasy of having a prick\r\nin each aperture\xe2\x80\x94screamed with wild cries of heavenly joy, spent\r\nfuriously, and eventually died away in an overpowering and indescribable\r\nfelicity. She soon recovered her senses, and begged for another bout\r\nbefore withdrawing. Of course there was immediate compliance and another\r\nmore soul-killing encounter was run off with the usual death-like\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nI had continuously gamahuched the Egerton who straddled over the two\r\nbodies below her, and brought her delicious cunt to my mouth, while my\r\narms encircled her beautifully formed and cream-like coloured buttocks,\r\nat the same time acting postillion with two fingers to increase her\r\nlustful gratification.\r\n\r\nWe purified ourselves after this, and drank some Champagne, then\r\nstanding stiff at the prospect of now possessing the lovely body of the\r\nEgerton, we took up the same position as before, the Count under, in\r\ncunt, the Egerton above, with her deliciously fair arse exposed to my\r\nembraces first, and my big prick afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe adored Benson gave it a suck first, and well wetting the knob,\r\nguided it to the narrow entrance of love\xe2\x80\x99s secret bower. Its head was\r\nsoon housed, and although still creating strange feelings, the previous\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s attack had made the entrance more facile.\r\n\r\nWith little halting we drove on to the first delicious discharge. The\r\nsecond bout was all divine pleasure, and ever after the delicious\r\nEgerton enjoyed it completely.\r\n\r\nThese delicious orgies with these two lovely women were indulged in on\r\nevery third day.\r\n\r\nI became a favourite with both their husbands, thanks to a kind of\r\nsheepish innocence that I had the power of putting on.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as my education had been well attended to and as I\r\nmyself was fond of study, attentive to my college instruction, and\r\nanxious for a knowledge of foreign languages, I had become fairly\r\nproficient in German and Spanish, and well read in French and Italian.\r\nThe latter was perfected by the Count\xe2\x80\x99s friendship, as we were much\r\ntogether and spoke nothing else. Perhaps it was this which led to a\r\ngreater friendship for me on the part of Mr. Egerton, who was an\r\nexcellent Italian scholar. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s intrigue with the Count had also\r\nperfected her, so that when we all four dined together Italian was the\r\nonly language spoken among us.\r\n\r\nThe dear Benson, too, was a perfect mistress of the Count\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, as\r\nwell she might, having it so often in her mouth; and as it is a soft\r\nlanguage that lends itself to love and lust, it became ours in all our\r\norgies.\r\n\r\nThe delicious Frankland, now Mrs. Nixon, returned to town with the\r\nspring. By that time I was established in my chambers in the Inner\r\nTemple, and had them simply furnished, but with every accessory for\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s combats in couples, or in the wildest orgies. The adorable Benson\r\ninaugurated and dedicated them to the service of holy mother Venus and\r\nher son Cupid, as well as the more lustful Eros.\r\n\r\nThe Egerton and the Count afterwards came to consecrate them to the\r\nworship of Priapus, and we had a most delicious orgy on that sacred\r\ncelebration.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that those two wild lustful creatures insisted\r\non seeing the Count and me in conjunction together. The Benson guided me\r\ninto the Count\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, while he was in the bottom of the Egerton, and\r\nthe Egerton conducted the Count into my bottom while I was luxuriating\r\nin the delicious arsehole of my adored Benson. It satisfied a longing\r\ndesire on their parts to see man with man, and did not displease either\r\nthe Count or myself, who, in our secret hearts, had each wished to\r\npossess the other.\r\n\r\nThe Count was a powerful and very hairy man, and had an especially very\r\nfull hairy arsehole, which to me was wildly exciting.\r\n\r\nIn that I differed from my dear friend MacCallum, who loved bare-arsed\r\nyouths with no hair there, telling me that coarse hairy arsed men rather\r\ndisgusted him, and although in his wide sodomitic experience he had had\r\nsuch, it was with a certain repugnance that went against the grain.\r\n\r\nIn that I differed from him entirely, the hairier and the coarser a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s arsehole was the more it excited me. In that respect the Count was\r\nexactly to my taste. He was very hairy all up the chink of his arse, and\r\nhad a very coarse skin and an almost black arsehole, so deep a brown it\r\nwas, the very sight of which always drove me mad with lust.\r\n\r\nHe as much loved me from another cause. His great letch was to frig a\r\nfine prick while buggering the possessor, hence, as he had never met\r\nwith so fine a one as mine, he was insatiably fond of being into me and\r\nfrigging me at the same time.\r\n\r\nWe thus had two points of private attraction, that made us become the\r\nclosest of friends, but we did not let any of our dear female\r\nparticipants know of the mutual joys of which they were not\r\nparticipants.\r\n\r\nThe superb Frankland, now my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s wife, also came alone to my\r\nchambers, and we had a renewal of all our wildest experiences. She told\r\nme it was such a comfort to her, for although her husband, Mr. Nixon,\r\nwas very loving, and did all he could, still it was nothing but exciting\r\nher to long for others, especially for my own huge prick, of which she\r\nnever knew but that she had been the first initiator of it into love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelicious recess in either sacred grove.\r\n\r\nSo fresh and eager as she was for the fray you may easily imagine the\r\nwild excess we indulged in, sucking, gamahuching, fucking, and\r\nbuggering. I cannot tell how often in every way her exciting and\r\nglorious body carried me away to an excess beyond anything I could have\r\nthought myself capable of.\r\n\r\nWhen fairly exhausted, and we could uninterruptedly talk over all that\r\nhad occurred since I had left my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, she heard in full\r\ndetail, for the first time, all my adventures.\r\n\r\nI had given her, at the time of her marriage, a hint of how matters had\r\ngone, yet without any details, which now she was voracious to hear. I\r\ntold her of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s and uncle\xe2\x80\x99s apparent seduction of me, nor did I\r\nhide our goings-on with young Dale, and my after-possession of Ellen and\r\nhis mother, who was the last to believe herself my seducer, for as I\r\ntold the delicious Frankland (I can never bear to call her Nixon), I had\r\nfollowed her sage advice, and up to the Dale had played off the innocent\r\ngame with perfect success; but now that I was a man I threw all that\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand who have you been throwing it overboard with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed at her ready taking of me up, and then went on to a full\r\nconfession of all my intrigues.\r\n\r\nShe did not like my having taken up with the two servants, the nieces of\r\nmy late landlady, thinking it derogatory in one endowed with a prick\r\nthat any lady would be too glad to possess, but she was very much struck\r\nwith my description of the superb body and wonderful lubricity of the\r\nNichols.\r\n\r\nIt excited her much, especially when I told her that she had given me\r\nthe idea of her near approach in body and wantonness to herself.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen hereafter to what a closer alliance with the Nichols\r\nthis led. Pressing her enquiries, I acknowledged my intrigue with the\r\nBenson, Egerton, and Count. This evidently excited her lust, as I could\r\nsee by the wild sparkle of her eye. It led to an immediate and delicious\r\nfuck, and when recovered from its ecstatic finish, to closer and more\r\nsearching enquiry as to how I got into such intimacy, but I had expected\r\nthis somewhat jealous scrutiny, and was quite prepared for it. I led her\r\nto believe they had been here nearly all the winter. I told her my\r\nmother had desired me to call and see the Bensons as friends of hers. I\r\nhad done so. The Bensons quickly observed how largely I was furnished,\r\nvery soon gave me encouragement, of which I did not want much after the\r\nlate intercourse I had had with herself, aunt, and Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\nThus matters came quickly to their natural conclusion. She was perfectly\r\nastonished at my powerful weapon, and as she and her dearest friend\r\nalready shared lovers, I was quickly introduced to her friend Mrs.\r\nEgerton, and they had me together, and let me into the secret of their\r\nintrigue with the Count, which was followed by my initiation into their\r\norgies.\r\n\r\nMy praises of these two ladies, and my saying how glorious it would be\r\nfor her to make a fifth, and my description of the exquisite body and\r\nthe tribadic tendencies of Mrs. Benson, fired her wild imagination, and\r\nwoke up all her tribadic lusts, and it ended in her begging me to give a\r\nluncheon at my chambers to the Benson and the Egerton, that she might be\r\nintroduced to them, more especially as they really moved in a society\r\nsomewhat higher than Mr. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s connections, although, in point of\r\nwealth, the Nixons were far superior.\r\n\r\nThe little luncheon came off most agreeably. The ladies all took to each\r\nother most warmly; seeing which, I boldly broke the ice, and telling the\r\nBenson and Egerton that dear Mrs. Nixon was my first initiator in love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmysteries, and as had both of them, the wisest thing we could do would\r\nbe to throw away all restraint and have a jollification all round. To\r\nset them at their ease\xe2\x80\x94for there was a momentary hesitation\xe2\x80\x94I pulled out\r\nmy prick at full stand, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a prick worthy of all your exquisite cunts, and one, too, that\r\nhas enjoyed them all, and been enjoyed by everyone of you. So throw away\r\nall hesitation and let him enjoy you all again. Who is to have it\r\nfirst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed, and all approached and handled it, interchanging their\r\nopinions upon its being the very finest one that any of them had ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is just the thing, you are at once put at ease,\r\nthen let us do it with ease; strip is the word, and let us have it\r\nluxuriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed, kissed each other, and said the dear fellow must have his\r\nway, and all at once proceeded to undress. The glorious and wonderfully\r\nhairy body of the Frankland perfectly astonished them, and raised their\r\ntribadic passions to fever heat, especially the Benson, who threw\r\nherself on that glorious form in an ecstasy of delight, more especially\r\nas the Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s passions being excited, her long red clitoris stood\r\nout from the dense black mass of hair which covered not only her belly\r\nand mount, but all down and around her cunt. Nothing would satisfy the\r\nBenson but an immediate mutual gamahuche, for, with true tribadic\r\ninstinct, these two beautiful and libidinous women divined their mutual\r\nletch for that particular lascivious inclination, and at once proceeded,\r\none on the top of the other, to wildly gamahuche each other. The Egerton\r\nand myself seized the opportunity of having a delicious fuck together,\r\nwhich we brought to a conclusion before the others had satisfied their\r\nimmediate desires.\r\n\r\nThe Frankland, who at first was under, was now above, and as she knelt\r\nand pushed out her stupendous arse to bring her cunt over the Benson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth, the sight of its hairy arsehole roused my desire to fuck it, and\r\nmy cock responded instantly, so kneeling behind her, I introduced it to\r\nthe well-known receptacle, and to her infinite additional delight,\r\nsodomised her to perfection. This was another means of putting them all\r\nat ease, and I fucked and buggered them all until neither handling nor\r\nsuction could get my prick to raise his head again.\r\n\r\nYou may easily imagine after this how delighted they were to make the\r\nglorious Frankland a participator in our orgies with the Count. Nor\r\nshall I forget the wild gaze of surprise and lust when the Count first\r\nbeheld the splendid and hairy form of the glorious Frankland when she\r\nentered the room in all the dazzling splendour of her perfect nakedness.\r\nThese two natures were made for each other, both salacious to a degree,\r\nboth vigorous in body and untiring in the most libidinous excesses of\r\nthe wildest lust. Both hairy to a degree, showing the meaning of that\r\nvast display all over both their bodies. They were instantly attracted\r\nto each other, flew into the closest of embraces, and sinking on the\r\nfloor where they met, two strokes were racked off before they came to a\r\nstate of more moderation, amenable to our general operations. It had\r\nbeen all the same an exciting scene to us.\r\n\r\nThe Benson was madly stimulated by the sight of the Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s superb\r\nbody; her long red clitoris, not satisfied with the double rack-off with\r\nthe Count, appeared only to be more excited, and stirred the whole soul\r\nof the adorable Benson. She threw herself in reverse upon the Frankland\r\nbefore she had time to raise herself, seized with her mouth the\r\nwonderful clitoris, called upon me to fuck her from behind, and then\r\nwith fingers up arsehole and cunt worked furiously. The dear Frankland\r\nresponded on the fine clitoris of the Benson, and postillioned me at the\r\nsame time. We ran off two bouts in this delicious position, and then\r\nwith more regulated passions rose to form more general combinations.\r\n\r\nThe Count had fucked the Egerton while we were engaged above the divine\r\nFrankland. Our first pose was suggested by the Egerton, who had been as\r\nyet less fucked than any. She had been also greatly taken with the\r\nglories of the Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s superb body, and especially struck with her\r\nextraordinary clitoris, and had taken the curious letch of wishing to\r\nhave it in her bottom-hole while riding St. George on my big prick. We\r\nall laughed at her odd choice, but agreed at once, especially the\r\nFrankland, whose greatest letch was to fuck very fair young women with\r\nher long and capable clitoris. A fairer creature than the lovely Egerton\r\ncould not be found. The Frankland admitted that in her inmost heart she\r\nhad longed thus to have the Egerton from the moment she had first seen\r\nher, and her delight and surprise at finding the dear Egerton had\r\nequally desired to possess her, fired her fierce lust with increased\r\ndesire. I lay down, the Egerton straddled over, and feeling the delight\r\nof my huge prick when completely imbedded, she spent profusely with only\r\ntwo rebounds. Then sinking on my belly she presented her lovely arse to\r\nthe lascivious embraces of the salacious Frankland, whose first act was\r\nto stoop, embrace, kiss, and tongue the beautiful little pinky aperture,\r\nwetting it with her saliva, she brought her fine long clitoris, stiff as\r\na prick, and plunged within. The letch that both had taken for the same\r\nindulgence lent enchantment to the act, and their wild imaginations\r\ncreated an excess of joy that the smaller size of the Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclitoris, in comparison with the dimensions of our longer pricks, might\r\nnot have led one to suppose possible.\r\n\r\nTwice we indulged in this excess, the women going off half-a-dozen times\r\nto my once.\r\n\r\nI had aided the Frankland by using a double dildo, which at once filled\r\nboth apertures. This excellent instrument was an invention of the\r\nFrankland, which she had suggested to a Parisian dildo maker, and had\r\nhad it made in two or three sizes. It became very useful in our orgies,\r\nas from disparity of numbers an odd couple were left out, when the\r\n_double jouissance_ was in operation, and then the two outsiders, with\r\ntongues and dildoes, could gamahuche with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nDuring our tribadic junction, with the Egerton fucked by the Frankland\r\nin the arse, the Count had first fucked and then sodomised the Benson to\r\ntheir mutual satisfaction. We all rose, purified, and refreshed with\r\nwine and biscuits, while discussing what our next move should be. The\r\nCount had not yet had the Frankland _in culo_, and suggested, as it was\r\nher introductory meeting, that the greater honours should be conferred\r\non her on this happy occasion, so I was to fuck her while he enjoyed her\r\nin the rear quarters. The Egerton and the Benson should use double\r\ndildoes to each other, or in any other way amuse themselves.\r\n\r\nThis was a most exquisite encounter, and with such unutterable enjoyment\r\nthat we hardly paused between the first and second, and it was not until\r\nwe had deluged thrice both interiors that we withdrew. The delighted\r\nFrankland had never ceased spending, but so vigorous a nature could\r\neasily have taken twice as much; but the other dear creatures had now to\r\nbe conciliated.\r\n\r\nThe Count next took the Benson in cunt while I blocked the rear\r\naperture, and the Frankland once more enculed the Egerton, who dildoed\r\nherself in cunt at the same time; all of us running two courses. We then\r\nrose, purified, and refreshed. When our pricks were ready it was the\r\nEgerton who took me in front and the Count behind, and the Benson, who\r\nhad grown lewd on the Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s clitoris, was sodomised by her and\r\ndildoed by herself. The Egerton still suffered a little in the double\r\nstretching, so that we ran but one exquisite bout, enabling us, whose\r\npowers began to fail to be re-excited, to finish with the _double\r\njouissance_ in the glorious body of the Frankland.\r\n\r\nWe carried this on until the midsummer holidays, when at their desire I\r\nintroduced the Benson, Egerton, Frankland, and the Count to my uncle,\r\naunt, Mrs. Dale, Ellen, and Harry, and we had some glorious orgies in my\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nThe splendour of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arse captivated the Frankland and the Count.\r\nThe latter soon got into young Dale\xe2\x80\x99s arse, which he did one day when\r\narriving for the very purpose half an hour before the appointed time of\r\nall meeting. I was present, and was so excited at the sight that I\r\nseized upon the Count\xe2\x80\x99s arse and delightedly astonished him by giving\r\nthe double enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIt was after this, as Harry remained to live with me, that he was\r\nintroduced to our general orgies, and thus we occupied all the dear\r\ncreatures at once, and most voluptuous and lascivious meetings we all\r\nenjoyed, the Count occasionally giving us a private visit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ellen had been put to the same finishing school where my\r\nsisters already were, with permission to go out with them on the\r\nSundays, when we always had a delicious orgy at our dear friend\r\nMacCallum\xe2\x80\x99s. He, like the Count, had taken a peculiar fancy for the\r\ntight young arsehole of Harry Dale, without altogether deserting the\r\nwomen, especially my sister Eliza, whose delight in rear sports was\r\nsupreme, and she never would be fucked but when she had a prick in each\r\naperture, preferring mine in her cunt with either Dale or MacCallum\r\noperating in the rear.\r\n\r\nKnowing the hours when I could not be interrupted by any of my lady\r\nfriends, I did not neglect the superb Nichols, but had her and Ann to\r\ncome together for an hour and a half, from half-past nine to eleven\r\na.m., and most delicious fucking I had with both. I had equally\r\ninitiated them into the mysteries of rear delights, and both took it\r\nwith great gusto. Upon finding this I gradually descanted on the\r\nexquisite delights of the _double jouissance_ with two male pricks,\r\nfilling with ecstasies indescribable the two apertures at once.\r\n\r\nWhen once I had excited their desires on this point, I mentioned my dear\r\nfriend MacCallum More, as one in whom we could all confide, and with\r\nsome little hesitation obtained their consent to introduce him. I had\r\nalready mentioned the matter to him; told him he might think the Nichols\r\ntoo old, but she was gloriously superb in body, and so extraordinarily\r\nwell preserved that her body was twenty years younger than her face and\r\nher lust and fucking powers were far superior to a woman of twenty-five.\r\nBesides, I hinted that he might persuade Ann, and perhaps her sister\r\nJane, to join our Lyon\xe2\x80\x99s Inn revels.\r\n\r\nWe met by appointment on a given morning. I advised MacCallum to come\r\nsooner, and when the women came, under the pretence of his not being\r\nable to join us that morning, I would get them stript, and when all was\r\nready he should appear in buff, and so break any _mauvaise honte_ they\r\nmight have at first undressing before him.\r\n\r\nHe was wonderfully struck with the superb body of the Nichols, and, as\r\nthe stranger, we gave him his choice. He clasped her in his nervous\r\narms, devoured her with kisses, and incontinently laying her down on the\r\nmattressed floor, proceeded to fuck her in the good old English fashion,\r\nwith legs and arms around her body. Ann and I gazed for a little on the\r\nsplendid action of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arse, and the evident way in which she\r\nmilked the teat as it withdrew each time he heaved his arse to re-enter\r\nwith exciting vigour. We could hold no longer and each ran a course of\r\necstatic delight ending in all the frenzy of lust to die inanimate the\r\nnext instant.\r\n\r\nOur charming partners had spent repeatedly during our encounter. They\r\nwanted an immediate renewal, but MacCallum suggested a change of\r\npartners and of position, that is to say, fucking them on their knees\r\nwith their splendidly developed buttocks turned up but taking them in\r\nthe cunt.\r\n\r\nThis change was rapidly effected. We placed ourselves in such a position\r\nthat each could see all the action of the other. It was a splendid fuck,\r\nand as our edge was taken off we drew it out a considerable length,\r\ngiving the dear recipients the opportunity of spending four or five\r\ntimes to our once.\r\n\r\nAfter recovering from the soaking after-joys of this delicious\r\nencounter, we had some champagne and some smutty talk, as well as\r\noutspoken praise of their splendid power of fuck; feeling their cunts\r\nand they our pricks, till renovated and renewed, we arranged for further\r\naction. As it was their introductory lesson in the double enjoyment, the\r\nsplendid Nichols had, of course, first choice. She chose me for cunt,\r\nand to his intense delight, our dear friend for the rear attack. Ann was\r\nto straddle over her aunt and me, and be gamahuched both in cunt and\r\narsehole by our friend. We had no difficulty in hilting ourselves to the\r\ncods in both apertures, but so excited was the Nichols that with the\r\nmere throbbings of our pricks on completely housing ourselves, she\r\nspent, squealing like a rabbit. We gave her time to fully enjoy it, and\r\nthen commenced a slow, regulated movement, which quickly drove the\r\nNichols into a state of furiously raving lust, and again she spent in an\r\nalmost killing agony of delight, screaming with excess of ecstasy. Again\r\nwe paused to allow of the utmost enjoyment, but renewed when her\r\ndelicious cunt and arse pressures announced a return of craving\r\nappetite. These pauses enabled us to bring on seven overpouring\r\ndischarges on her part, until she was quite exhausted, especially when\r\nwe both came together in an excess of joy that ended in perfect\r\ninanition, on recovering from which we relieved the Nichols of the\r\ndouble cargo within her.\r\n\r\nShe had already almost strangled me with her embraces in the unutterable\r\njoys I had procured her. Rolling off on her side she drew MacCallum also\r\nto her, to embrace him for the intense gratification he had afforded\r\nher. We again refreshed the inward man after a purification and laving\r\nwith cold water, as a restorative. Then Ann took up her position in her\r\nturn, for she, too, wished to try the novel experiment with the smaller\r\nprick in her arsehole.\r\n\r\nThe Nichols felt exhausted for the moment, so lay on the sofa and\r\nenjoyed the sight of our three persons in all the delirium of raging\r\nlust and sodomy. The experiment enchanted Ann as it had overpoweringly\r\nenchanted her aunt. She, too, spent seven or eight times before joining\r\nus in our soul-killing discharge. The Nichols had laid still for about\r\ntwo thirds of the time this bout continued, she then rose to straddle\r\nacross Ann and me, and was about to present her magnificently large cunt\r\nto be gamahuched by MacCallum, but he begged her to turn her bottom to\r\nhim and heave it well up, while resting her hands on Ann\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. He\r\nthen could first contemplate and handle her huge superb buttocks, then\r\ntransferring his hands to her clitoris and cunt, he licked and tongued\r\nthe grand aperture of her arse\xe2\x80\x94rough, brown, and corrugated, just my\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nWe had a most glorious bout, ending in all the ecstatic joys of spending\r\nand after-delights. Ann was as greatly gratified with the _double\r\njouissance_ as her aunt had been before. We again laved and refreshed,\r\nand closed this most delicious orgy with MacCallum first in the Nichols\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncunt, with my big and doted-on prick in her arse, which, now she was\r\nused to it, pleased her more than ever.\r\n\r\nIn the same order we double-fucked Ann, although she expressed her\r\ngreater gratification of MacCallum in her arse and my splitter in her\r\ncunt. Again we gamahuched them both, as time would not allow of our\r\nresurrection, then they left us.\r\n\r\nMy guardian, at his marriage, had bought a house in Portland Place, but\r\nthe lease of its then tenant only expired on the 20th March this spring,\r\nand before being occupied it had to be entirely new painted and\r\ndecorated, so that July was nearly at an end before they could\r\ncomfortably take up their residence in it. Meanwhile they had apartments\r\nat a hotel near Hyde Park corner.\r\n\r\nWhen once they were completely housed, which was not the case until the\r\nmiddle of August, my guardian desired his wife to send the carriage for\r\nthe girls every Sunday morning. Hearing that Ellen was their intimate\r\nfriend, she became included in the invitation. This put an end to our\r\nSunday orgies in our friend MacCallum\xe2\x80\x99s chambers, much to our mutual\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nAs far as Harry and I were concerned the ever thoughtful and delicious\r\nFrankland came to our aid. Pretending that the girls must need walking\r\nexercise, she always after luncheon proposed they should walk down to\r\ntheir brother\xe2\x80\x99s chambers in the Temple, take him and Harry as their\r\nfurther companions up to Kensington Gardens or the \xe2\x80\x9cZoo,\xe2\x80\x9d and bring all\r\nback to dinner.\r\n\r\nAs my guardian always took a siesta on Sundays after luncheon, for being\r\ntoo old to fuck his wife every night, Saturday night, or rather Sunday\r\nmorning, when he had nothing in the way of business to trouble him, was\r\ndedicated to two or three hours of extra dalliance with his adored wife.\r\nShe told me he was very amorous upon her, could not do much fucking,\r\nindeed, she thought his efforts that way were even more than he ought to\r\ndo at his age, but he was never tired of gamahuching her and posing her\r\nin every attitude when stark naked; of course she lent herself to every\r\nwish of the old man, and had, even after great persuasion, which only\r\nher love and attachment to him could have even made her consent, allowed\r\nhim the honours of her beautiful arsehole. This requiring, as he said,\r\nan extra firmness of prick, she further did him the extra favour of\r\ntoying and sucking his prick up to the utmost stiffness. So she had made\r\nhim absolutely adore her, and she could turn him round her little\r\nfinger. Her word and will was law, so she could do as she liked.\r\n\r\nShe told me on several occasions that she thought he was exerting his\r\nerotic powers to too great an extent, and that she did all she could to\r\nmoderate his excitement, but all to no purpose; he was infatuated with\r\nthe glorious charms of her body, or what is called cunt-struck, perhaps\r\nthe strongest passion that can seize on man and dangerous for a man of\r\nadvanced years. Well, his Sunday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s siesta was long, and left\r\nthe Frankland at liberty to come to my rooms with my sisters, where\r\nstrip was the word, and fucking in every variety followed.\r\n\r\nI soon found we must have other help; the pace I was going at was\r\nbeginning to tell, so with the consent of the darling Frankland I made a\r\nconfidant of the Count, and asked him to join our Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s orgy. You may\r\nimagine with what joy he accepted, for apart from his delight in seeing\r\nme in incestuous connection with my sisters, their young charms,\r\nespecially Eliza\xe2\x80\x99s, had great attraction for him, and then the\r\nFrankland, so similar in lust and temperament. We had thus most\r\ndelicious orgies every Sunday afternoon, until the end of October of the\r\nfollowing year, when my sisters had finished their schooling, and I,\r\ntoo, had left college, entered at the Middle Temple, and had been for\r\nthree months in a conveyancer\xe2\x80\x99s office, reading up previous to being\r\ncalled to the bar.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Mr. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s health gave symptoms of serious\r\ndisturbance, and his doctor recommended him to pass the winter in a\r\nwarmer climate. His wife suggested the advantage travelling would be\r\nboth to the girls and myself; she had only to express the wish to have\r\nus all together, and we were warmly invited to join them.\r\n\r\nWe passed through Switzerland, Milan, and Florence to Rome, where we\r\ntook up our residence for four months.\r\n\r\nThe Egertons and Bensons happily spent the same winter at Rome.\r\n\r\nMy rooms were in an adjoining palace to where Mr. and Mrs. Nixon and my\r\nsisters resided, there not being accommodation for me. I thus had a\r\ncharming entresol of five rooms all to myself; one of which looked on\r\nand over the Tiber, and was in no way overlooked. To this room we\r\nconstantly resorted for orgies.\r\n\r\nThe Egertons had passed some winters in Rome, and she had two or three\r\nclerical lovers, and these had introduced two others to the Benson on\r\nher former visits, and all had been accustomed to general orgies. You\r\nmay imagine the delight of these priestly debauchees when they found\r\nthemselves introduced to our circle of three fresh cunts, and such\r\nsplendid ones, and all without any mock-modest prejudices but up to\r\nevery excess of lubricity. So to five women we thus had six men, and\r\neventually a very handsome young priest, debauched by the others, joined\r\nour party, and we carried on the wildest and most extravagant orgies of\r\nevery excess the most raging lust could devise. We made chains of pricks\r\nin arseholes, the women between with dildoes strapped round their waist,\r\nand shoved into the arsehole of the man before them, while his prick was\r\ninto the arsehole of the woman in his front.\r\n\r\nThese holy fathers had immense resources in the way of infinite variety,\r\nstimulating to excesses of debauchery that very soon brought the rod\r\ninto requisition.\r\n\r\nWe all from time to time enjoyed the double coition, the women\r\ninvariably so at every meeting.\r\n\r\nThese holy fathers had all very fine pricks, but none so large as mine,\r\nand many of them loved to have my prick in their arses when opportunity\r\noffered. In such delights the winter passed rapidly away.\r\n\r\nIn the spring Mr. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s health seemed very precarious, and we moved to\r\nNaples, where from necessity our extreme indulgence in venereal excesses\r\nwas much curtailed.\r\n\r\nIn May we returned to England, but poor Mr. Nixon was evidently fucked\r\nout. The Frankland told me that the more his health failed the more lewd\r\nhe seemed to grow. His passion for gamahuching her cunt had increased,\r\nand even his prick seemed to gather new life as life ebbed away, for\r\nhardly a night passed without his fucking her, at night in the cunt, and\r\nat morning, in full daylight, kneeling and feeling her splendid arse, he\r\ntook her in the rear aperture. He and she too felt it was killing him,\r\nbut his infatuation was overpowering, and he declared if it did kill him\r\nhe could not die a happier death. In fact a month after we returned he\r\nhad an apoplectic fit actually when his prick was spending in her\r\narsehole. He lived but a month afterwards. He left all his property to\r\nhis wife absolutely, with legacies of \xc2\xa32,500 to each of my sisters, and\r\n\xc2\xa31,000 to me.\r\n\r\nThis sad event cast a gloom for some time over all our pleasures.\r\n\r\nThe Frankland took my sisters to reside with her, but all went down to\r\nspend the first three months of mourning quietly with my mother. She,\r\ntoo, took ill when we were with her, and died before the three months\r\nwere up. This drew me down to home, now mine, and the dear Frankland\r\ncontinued to stay with us for two months longer, and then left for\r\nLondon. We three orphans remained for all that winter in our old home,\r\nsettling a variety of things.\r\n\r\nMy sisters now with their succession to some \xc2\xa3600 apiece, the \xc2\xa31,000\r\nleft them by our uncle, and the \xc2\xa32,500 by Mr. Nixon, and the \xc2\xa3400 which\r\nI promised them as a marriage present, and with their great beauty of\r\nform and face, for both had grown into remarkably fine young women,\r\nbecame very eligible matches.\r\n\r\nMany country families sought us out after the first three months of our\r\nmourning, and several offers were made to the girls. They were both\r\nsomewhat fastidious after the life they had led, but eventually both\r\nwere married. Mary to a very nice fellow, who proved, as she told me, a\r\nfirst-rate fucker. He got her with child, and they had a son, a fine\r\nboy, in the tenth month of their marriage. She was very happy, now and\r\nthen coming to see me, and getting a jolly good fuck from my renovated\r\nprick, for now that he was lying fallow, my somewhat exhausted system\r\nwas getting quite recruited.\r\n\r\nAlas! poor Mary lost her husband by cholera in the second year of their\r\nmarriage. He had a handsome estate, and left her well off, and sole\r\nguardian to his son, who grew up a very fine fellow, and when at puberty\r\nbecame the solace of his widowed mother, who had initiated him into all\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries.\r\n\r\nEliza was not quite so fortunate as her sister in her husband; he was a\r\ngood sort of man who, one would have thought, would just have suited the\r\nhot temperament of Eliza, well and powerfully built, and with an air of\r\nbeing a man of erotic passions; but he turned out to be of a languid\r\nunimpassioned nature, who could not imagine any other manner than simply\r\nmounting on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s belly and fucking her once a night, and with no\r\nconception of using either preliminaries or aids to her passions. So\r\nthat he left poor Eliza only in a state of excitement instead of giving\r\nany satisfaction to her lascivious nature. She did, eventually, work him\r\nup to good night and good morning, but for her full satisfaction she\r\nused to seek elsewhere, and even to content herself with the embraces of\r\na man servant, who, if not good looking, proved to have a splendid and\r\npowerful prick, and nearly daily gave her comfort. She also occasionally\r\ncame to me, when she had both apertures well exercised, and left me much\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nShe never had any children, and so managed her intrigues as never to be\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\nI returned to London in the spring, and was called to the bar.\r\n\r\nI went the western circuit for odd assizes, and then abandoned the bar\r\nas a profession.\r\n\r\nHarry Dale, with more perseverance, as well as greater necessity for\r\nexertion, continued in the profession, was duly called to the bar, and\r\neventually became a rising and successful barrister, and at this period\r\nof our old age is now a distinguished judge.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our earlier days.\r\n\r\nHarry and I carried on our intrigue with the Nichols and Ann, aided by\r\nour dear friend MacCallum. Also from time to time with the Benson,\r\nEgerton, and Count, to which generally the darling Frankland brought her\r\nexquisite charms to intoxicate us with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis delightful reunion was sadly affected by the loss of the Count, who\r\nreceived an amnesty\xe2\x80\x94I think I before have said he was a political\r\nexile\xe2\x80\x94returned to his own country, and we never again had his delightful\r\naid in our sadly shortened orgies.\r\n\r\nThe Count and I met in a future year at his old castle on the hills of\r\nPied, of which I shall have much more to say on a later occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad loss, especially for the Egerton, who dearly loved the\r\nCount. He had been her first lover, indeed, her initiator in the real\r\nmysteries of Venus. It will be remembered that her husband was one of\r\nthose old insensible natures that think it is only necessary to hastily\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpiss their tallow,\xe2\x80\x9d as Falstaff says, as quickly as they can, and leave\r\na poor woman just sufficiently excited to be madly anxious for a\r\nthorough good fucking. It is these insensate cold-blooded husbands who\r\nraise, without satisfying, their wife\xe2\x80\x99s erotic passions, and drive them\r\nperforce to seek salacious comfort in other arms.\r\n\r\nOh! how many women if only fucked with some regard to their own\r\nnaturally lewd feeling, would have never committed adultery or made a\r\nscandal. Many are the women who have told me, with tears in their eyes,\r\nof the cold insensible conduct of their husbands, who, never fucking\r\nthem but when their sluggish natures felt the want, then turning upon\r\nthem without the slightest preparatory handling or embracing, mount,\r\nshove it in, give a few in-and-out movements, spend, and then withdraw,\r\njust as they have done enough to excite their poor wives\xe2\x80\x99 passions\r\nwithout satisfying them, and thus leaving them a prey to inordinate\r\nlonging that forces them to seek the relief to their passions the\r\nselfish brutes of husbands had only raised without allaying.\r\n\r\nI remember an intrigue I had with an Italian Countess. Her husband, a\r\ntall and very capable man, was an extreme bigot, who thought it deadly\r\nsin to indulge in any caresses or carnal excitement, or even for his\r\nwife to expose any naked flesh to raise concupiscent ideas, so she had\r\nto have her nightgown closed up to her throat, with long sleeves and\r\nskirts, in the centre a slit through which he performed his duty when in\r\nwant of relief to himself. He never kissed or embraced her body at any\r\ntime, but lay like a log by her side, with his back turned to her. When\r\nhis own passions prompted him to fuck, which was very seldom, he was\r\nnaturally quite ready and rapidly finished his coup. He used to turn to\r\nher, waken her up with a shake, cry out, _\xe2\x80\x9cMarietta, porgemi il vaso\r\ngenerative\xe2\x80\x9d_ (Marietta, reach me the generative vase), upon which she\r\nstretched herself on her back, he got on her without lifting her\r\npetticoats or feeling her cunt, but opening the slit, pointed his prick\r\nto her cunt, thrust it up to the hilt, and being himself in want of\r\nspermatic relief, in a very few strokes spent, just staying in long\r\nenough to \xe2\x80\x9cpiss all his tallow,\xe2\x80\x9d and then withdraw, turning his back\r\nagain to sleep, leaving his wife just sufficiently excited to have\r\nenjoyed it, and thus left her madly longing for the satisfaction he did\r\nnot afford. She said he was quite capable, too, of giving satisfaction\r\nif his bigotry had allowed him. We used to fuck at a tremendous rate,\r\nand I always commenced with a _\xe2\x80\x9cMarietta, Marietta, porgemi il vaso\r\ngenerative,\xe2\x80\x9d_ and then proceeded to fuck and laugh like mad.\r\n\r\nOf course, irritated as her hot passions were by her booby of a husband,\r\nshe resorted, not only to me, but to whomsoever she could get to satisfy\r\nthe cravings of her irritated cunt.\r\n\r\nThe Bensons and Egertons again left in the autumn for Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Frankland, not yet out of her year\xe2\x80\x99s widowhood, did not go much into\r\nsociety, and we saw much more of her than before. She came at least\r\nthree times a week to my chambers, when Harry and I gave her the comfort\r\nshe so much required; first each fucking her singly twice over, and then\r\nthree double-pleasure fucks, with change about in the apertures:\r\nfinishing off with a mouth fuck from one or the other, and a double\r\ngamahuche.\r\n\r\nAbout once a week the amorous and delicious-fucking Nichols with Ann\r\nwould come of a morning, when we managed to send both away satisfied for\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nWhen winter drove our friend MacCallum home from his fishing, we renewed\r\nsome excellent orgies at his chambers, where Ann, and afterwards Jane,\r\noccasionally came. By the way, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s arse had developed in an\r\nextraordinary manner, and became one of the most exciting delights of\r\nour orgies at MacCallum\xe2\x80\x99s. He also now joined in our morning encounters\r\nwith the Nichols and her niece.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas time the Frankland, Harry, and I all went down by\r\ninvitation to the Rectory, where uncle welcomed with great delight the\r\nglorious and exciting Frankland. Mrs. Dale and Ellen joined our party.\r\nDear aunt positively devoured me with her caresses, and before I was\r\nshown up to my room, had drawn me into her little room downstairs, had a\r\nsuck at my prick, leant her body on the table, stuck out her immense\r\narse, and had me into her cunt for a rapid rack-off; but this only\r\nexcited me to an immediate renewal, for the touch and sight of her\r\nsplendid buttocks instantly produced a stiffness, she herself in the\r\nmiddle of my movements in front, drawing my prick out of her cunt and\r\nguiding it into the inviting entrance to the secret altar of Juno and of\r\nVenus Callipyge. Both courses were run off at a gallop, and were a\r\nmomentary allaying of the insatiable salacity of my most lewd and\r\nlascivious aunt. She then next conducted the Frankland, I can never call\r\nher Nixon, into her bedroom, under pretence of showing her to it. She no\r\nsooner had her there than up went her petticoats, and aunt glued her\r\nlips to the wonderful clitoris of the divine Frankland, and using\r\nfingers up both apertures, made the Frankland quickly give down her\r\nfirst offering to the obscene god.\r\n\r\nAs soon as aunt\xe2\x80\x99s tribadic rage to possess the Frankland was thus abated\r\nfor the moment, she allowed Mrs. Nixon to remove bonnet and shawl, but\r\nthen as quickly demanded and obtained a double gamahuche. The Frankland\r\nthe more readily consenting as she knew aunt had taken the keen edge off\r\nmy lecherous appetite, and she would revel in the thick raging sperm I\r\nhad shot into both orifices. These preliminaries settled, we were able\r\nto be much more tranquil all the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe Dale and Ellen came to dinner; I slipt into their room when all were\r\ndressing for dinner, and had a delicious rack-off in both their\r\nlecherous and longing cunts. Uncle had equally enjoyed the tight\r\nfavourite arsehole of Harry Dale, he having conducted him to the\r\nwell-known summer house for that purpose as soon as we arrived.\r\n\r\nWe could all thus peaceably enjoy the good things set before us, and\r\nduring our wine after dinner exchange accounts of all events that had\r\npassed since last we met, and they were varied, for Mr. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nand legacies to my sisters and myself were subjects of congratulation,\r\nwhile the death of my mother was, on the contrary, one of condolence and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nBy ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock we all broke up, but with the whispered request to all to\r\nrepair to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom half an hour after the household had retired.\r\nWe were all too interested in the delicious orgy there to take place to\r\nfail. Blazing fires in both that and the adjoining room had been kept up\r\nall the afternoon; plenty of lights were burning so as to illuminate all\r\nsides at once. We all met in mere night wrappers, and as soon as we were\r\nassembled and the word given \xe2\x80\x9coff,\xe2\x80\x9d they were thrown aside, and we all\r\nstood in nature\xe2\x80\x99s lovely nakedness. Aunt, in her eager and lascivious\r\ninspirations, flung herself on my naked body, drew me to the bed, and\r\nhad me into her longing and delicious cunt at once, and with legs and\r\narms thrown round me, was instantly pressing furiously forward,\r\nnotwithstanding the remonstrance of my uncle, who wished to arrange a\r\ngeneral plan of operations so as to include all at once. Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoluptuous eagerness produced a rapid discharge on her part. Seeing\r\nthis, while she was in the momentary ecstasy of spending, he was enabled\r\nto drag me from her arms, fortunately before I had weakened my powers by\r\nspending for a fourth time that day. Aunt, too, was now in a condition\r\nto listen to reason, and bring her ideas of our after-combinations into\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nAs we had brought the Count with us for a week\xe2\x80\x99s stay, we were just four\r\ncocks to four hens; so we could couple in the first instance on an exact\r\nequality, it being necessary by previous good fucking to bring the\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s passions up to a boiling heat of lust to make them enter into\r\nour greater excesses with all the wild energy of the most salacious\r\nlubricity. Aunt had taken a great fancy to the Count when up at\r\nmidsummer.\r\n\r\nUncle was most lecherous on the glorious Frankland. I took most readily\r\nto the luscious and lascivious Dale, who was equally eager to repossess\r\nthe prick which she firmly believed she had initiated into all the joys\r\nof cunt, and a most delicious fuck we had, she spending furiously and\r\nfrequently to my once.\r\n\r\nHarry was equally pleased to pair off with his loved cousin, whose\r\nmaidenhead he had undoubtedly taken.\r\n\r\nThe women would gladly have had each fucker run a second course without\r\ndrawing. But both aunt and uncle opposed this, as both more exhausting\r\nand less variety. So aunt chose me, uncle took the exciting young cunt\r\nof Ellen, Harry turned on to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, from whence he had\r\noriginally come into the world, and the Count got the glorious\r\nFrankland, of whom he was never tired. This course was more prolonged by\r\nthe men than the first, with the object of somewhat allaying the\r\ninsatiable lust of the women by making them spend infinitely oftener\r\nthan their fuckers.\r\n\r\nWe so managed matters that we all came together or nearly so, and the\r\nwomen followed suit at the last final crisis, which was ushered in with\r\nwild cries of lust, and then a sudden overpowering silence fell on all\r\nas they lay panting in all the after-joys that follow the ecstatic\r\ndischarge of life\xe2\x80\x99s essence.\r\n\r\nWe rose for a general embrace of our naked bodies, then a romp, and a\r\nmutual slapping of arses and seizing of pricks and cunts, a very\r\nexciting game, which soon brought evidences of renewed vigour in all\r\nexcept poor uncle, who required a longer pause and an extra excitement\r\nbefore he could indulge in a third encounter.\r\n\r\nThe Count took the delicious arsehole of the Frankland, who begged for\r\nme as her fucker. Aunt got Mrs. Dale under for a double gamahuche, while\r\nHarry crammed his prick up aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arse. Uncle enjoyed a delicious\r\ngamahuche with Ellen, who sucked his limp prick all the time without any\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThis was a delicious bout for us all, and ended in heavenly raptures.\r\n\r\nOur second double couplings were: myself in my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, which incest\r\nstimulated uncle to a stand, and he took to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arse while her\r\nnephew incestuously fucked her cunt. The Count took to the delicious and\r\nmost exciting tight cunt of the Dale, while her son shoved his prick\r\ninto his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arse, to her unspeakable satisfaction. Ellen and the\r\nFrankland amused themselves with tribadic extravagances.\r\n\r\nThis bout was long drawn out, and afforded inexpressible ecstasies to\r\nall concerned. And after the wild cries and most bawdy oaths that\r\ninstantly preceded the final ecstasy, the dead silence and long\r\nafter-enjoyments were drawn out to a greater length than before. After\r\nwhich we all rose and purified, and then took refreshment of wine and\r\ncake, while discussing our next arrangement of couples.\r\n\r\nUncle had, fortunately for him, managed not to spend in the last bout;\r\nhe, therefore, was still capable of entering an arsehole, and he chose\r\nthe delicious arse of the Frankland to receive this final offering, for\r\nafter that he was done for that night. I was below engulphed in the\r\nexquisite cunt of the Frankland. The Count fucked Ellen while Harry was\r\ninto her behind. Aunt and Mrs. Dale mutually gamahuched and dildoed each\r\nother. This, too, was a long-drawn-out affair and ended in perfectly\r\nconvulsive ecstasies and cries of the wildest sensuality that our most\r\nsalacious passions could prompt.\r\n\r\nI then took my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arse while the lecherous Dale was underneath\r\ngamahuching and dildoing her, and by putting the Dale close to the edge\r\nof the bed, the Count stood between her legs, which were thrown over his\r\nshoulders, and thus he fucked her, having taken a letch to fuck her\r\ncunt, which was an exquisite one for fucking: her power of nip being\r\nnearly equal to the Frankland, and only beaten by aunt\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary\r\npower in that way. We thus formed a group of four enchained in love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwildest sports together.\r\n\r\nThe Frankland was gamahuched by uncle while having Harry\xe2\x80\x99s prick in her\r\narse, Ellen acting postillion to Harry\xe2\x80\x99s arse while frigging herself\r\nwith a dildo.\r\n\r\nThe closing bout of the night was the Count into aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arse, my prick\r\ninto the Frankland\xe2\x80\x99s arse, Harry enjoying an old-fashioned fuck with his\r\nmother, and Ellen under aunt to dildo and be gamahuched and dildoed by\r\naunt. We drew this bout out to an interminable length, and lay for\r\nnearly half an hour in the annihilation of the delicious after-joys. At\r\nlast we rose, purified, and then restoring our exhausted frames with\r\nChampagne, embraced and sought well-earned sleep in our separate\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nI slept the sleep of the just, and awoke late to find aunt sucking my\r\nstiff-standing prick at the very instant it was filling her mouth with a\r\ndeluge of creamy spunk. She sucked up to the get all out, and in doing\r\nso brought him up to the scratch again, so jumping out of my low bed I\r\nmade her kneel on it, stick out her enormous arse, and licked her\r\nreeking cunt until I could stand it no longer. Then bringing my huge\r\nprick I plunged in a single vigorous thrust up to the very top of her\r\ncunt, and made her squeal and spend with that alone. Pausing to let her\r\nenjoy it, I recommenced and ran a delicious course in that most\r\nexquisite cunt, and would have done so a second time, after a pause of\r\necstasy, if Harry Dale had not rushed into the room to say that all were\r\nimpatiently awaiting me to sit down to breakfast. Aunt just stayed to\r\ngive a final suck to my prick, and then vanished.\r\n\r\nI hastened to wash and dress, having sent Harry off to beg they would\r\nnot wait for me.\r\n\r\nOn joining them the sly jokes they cut at my apparent laziness proved\r\nthat they knew of the cause of detention. I looked at dear aunt, and at\r\nonce saw by the air of gratification on her dear plump face, that she\r\nherself had been boasting of her exploit, for it was all her own doing.\r\n\r\nBeing Sunday, we all went decorously to church. The doctor gave us a\r\nvery unctuous sermon on the goodness of virtue and chastity. It was a\r\nreally fine sermon, and delivered with an unction that forbade the\r\npossibility of supposing that the preacher could be in reality the very\r\nreverse of his doctrine. It much pleased some of the country families,\r\nand one or two with their wives waited for the doctor leaving the\r\nchurch, to compliment him on his eloquence and admirable teaching. The\r\nflattered doctor ended by inviting two rather distant residents to\r\nluncheon at the Rectory, so that we formed a numerous party, all on our\r\nbest behaviour. It was quite edifying to hear the pious and virtuous\r\nremarks of the admirable Frankland, and the no less virtuous and correct\r\nDale. It gained them the entree into the exclusive set of both these\r\nhigh country families, and eventually led to an excellent marriage for\r\nthe dear little Ellen. So much for the success of dissimulation. Vice\r\nplaying the part of virtue, and succeeding to perfection. So goes the\r\nworld. One thing is certain, that on this occasion it enforced chastity,\r\nin one sense at least, that we had no opportunity of practising vice\r\nthat afternoon. The charming Frankland-Nixon made a great impression on\r\nthe wives as well as husbands, to be sure it was well known that she was\r\na very wealthy widow, and they may have had some design of securing her\r\nfor a son, nephew, or at least having the chance at it. She thanked them\r\nwith that grace and charming ease of manner which so distinguished her\r\nand made her so captivating, excusing herself from visiting, during the\r\nfirst year of her widowhood, anywhere but among family friends, and as\r\nher late husband was Charles Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s and his sisters\xe2\x80\x99 guardian, she\r\nconsidered his family as almost her own. They hoped to have the pleasure\r\nof seeing her some future day.\r\n\r\nThe whole visit passed off very pleasantly, and left us only an hour for\r\na stroll in the garden and time to dress for dinner. It will be\r\nrecollected that the doctor was a great exacter of full evening dress at\r\ndinner, as tending to keep up proper appearances.\r\n\r\nWe met at the accustomed hour at night in aunt\xe2\x80\x99s room, in the full dress\r\nof Adam and Eve before they munched the apple.\r\n\r\nThis night was dedicated chiefly to sacrifices to Venus Apostrophia, for\r\nthe doctor commenced by having the Count while he was fucking his wife,\r\nand when able to get his fine old cock in for another go, would only\r\nagain have it in my arse, while I was doing the same to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s glorious\r\nimmensity with the Count below fucking her.\r\n\r\nThat was the end of poor uncle\xe2\x80\x99s powers for that night, but he\r\ngamahuched all the women at the finish of their encounters with us three\r\nmen. We gave them all the _double jouissance_, while those unoccupied\r\ncarried on their own little game with tongue or dildo.\r\n\r\nIt was again a night of most exquisite enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe following and remaining nights of our visit brought into requisition\r\nthe rod before uncle could get his dear old prick to stand, and myself\r\ntailed off on the next Sunday night, the last of our visit, so that\r\nuncle seeing what he called the laziness of my prick, seized the rod,\r\nand gave me as sound a flogging as ever he had done in my schoolboy\r\ndays. The fact was that he had been longing to renew on my arse his\r\nletch for giving a really severe whipping. He had already by dint of the\r\nsame punishment fucked the arses of the Count and the divine Frankland,\r\nand was now so excited anew that his prick stood as stiff as ever it\r\ndid; and my red excoriated arse excited and renewed his very fine prick;\r\nbut first I insisted upon moving to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arse, who at the moment was\r\nhaving a last fuck from the Count, and this incestuous group closed our\r\norgies on this occasion, for we left for town the next day.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast in the morning I slipt into the Dale\xe2\x80\x99s room, and had a\r\nparting fuck both with her and Ellen. Harry came in while we were at\r\nwork, Ellen under the Dale gamahuching her, and I above administering a\r\nrear adieu. Harry stopped us for a moment until he could withdraw Ellen\r\nand take her place, that he might have a parting fuck with his loved\r\nmother, who thus had the two pricks she most loved in the world into her\r\ntogether. We drew our pleasure out to the utmost length our lust would\r\nallow of and spent in the most ecstatic joy that poor human nature could\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nAunt had gone to the Count\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom at the very time we were meeting in\r\nMrs. Dale\xe2\x80\x99s. Notwithstanding which, her insatiable cunt made her draw me\r\ninto her sanctum downstairs for a final fuck at the last moment of our\r\nparting.\r\n\r\nHarry Dale staying behind to pass a week at home with his mother, the\r\nadorable Frankland, the Count and I returned to town together. On the\r\njourney up we agreed to dine at Very\xe2\x80\x99s in Regent Street, and have a\r\ncomparatively quiet night all together at my chambers, which we did,\r\nluxuriating in having the glorious naked body of the delicious Frankland\r\nbetween us. After we had each bedewed both her front and rear orifices\r\nwith our life\xe2\x80\x99s balmy essence, we slept soundly till morning, when we\r\nrenewed our double offerings on those glorious and delicious altars,\r\nthen breakfasted.\r\n\r\nThis was the last occasion but one of our having the Count, whose time\r\nfor departure to his own country was drawing near.\r\n\r\nHe left that day on a visit to a family in Scotland, whose son and heir\r\nwas really the fruit of his loins.\r\n\r\nOn his return some fortnight later we again passed a night with our\r\nexquisite friend the Frankland, and being both fresh from the country,\r\nwe administered so many delicious coups to both apertures as quite\r\ncontented her salacious love of prick. We parted next day with our loved\r\nfriend the Count, but not for the last time, as I shall relate in its\r\nproper place\xe2\x80\x94a delightful visit we paid to him in his old ancestral\r\ncastle, and an after-rencontre with him and his sister in Turin.\r\n\r\nI saw my loved Frankland to her home and left town myself the same\r\nafternoon for my home in the country, to arrange for various repairs and\r\nalterations required on the property.\r\n\r\nI took my dear friend MacCallum with me. We spent a pleasant ten days,\r\nvaried with a visit first from one of my sisters and then from the\r\nother, for two nights each, and jolly nights we spent fucking in every\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s belly was up, but she declared it only made fucking more\r\ndelicious than ever to her, still more with the _double jouissance_, in\r\nwhich she preferred the smaller prick of MacCallum to mine in her arse.\r\n\r\nWhen Eliza came she stayed a third night, and taxed our powers to the\r\nutmost; she was such a glutton for fuck on this occasion, declaring that\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s want of power, as well as tact, left her more lewd after\r\nhis fucking her than she was before, so that she had been forced by the\r\nexcess of her unsatisfied lust produced by her husband to have recourse\r\nto the fine prick of her footman, a powerful young fellow, otherwise\r\nvery plain, and not likely to inspire jealousy to any husband, but with\r\nwhom she rarely could do more than get a rack-off in a hurry, which was\r\nfar from satisfaction sufficient for her hot passions. It was this that\r\nmade her revel with such insatiable desires in the possession of our\r\nalmost untiring pricks. Differing from Mary in her love of rear-fucking,\r\nit was my big prick she loved best to have in her arse, while\r\nMacCallum\xe2\x80\x99s lesser shaft satisfied her less exacting cunt. She was\r\ncertainly one of the lewdest creatures ever made, wildly lascivious and\r\nfull of variety. She had the most engaging ways with her, and could\r\nraise a prick from the dead. She was a worthy pupil of the Frankland,\r\nand had all the love and longing for prick, and cunt too, that our\r\ndeliciously insatiable aunt was so famous for. She grew older, and\r\nbecoming one of the most desirable women, I never tired of fucking her\r\nin both orifices whenever the opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\nI returned to town just in time to have a parting orgy with the Count\r\nand the Frankland in my chambers, which I before said was a night of the\r\nwildest orgies.\r\n\r\nMacCallum was called to the country by the illness of some of his\r\nfamily, and was absent for six months, so I was left with Harry to have\r\noccasional orgies together with the Frankland three times a week, and\r\nwith the Nichols and Ann or Jane once a week by way of variety, but as\r\nthey only came for a morning visit, these were not exhausting\r\nencounters, so that we lay comparatively in fallow, till the return of\r\nthe Benson and Egerton, when they and the lovely Frankland taxed us to\r\nthe utmost twice or thrice a week.\r\n\r\nThus time progressed. The Frankland had been a widow for nearly two\r\nyears when she proposed to travel for two or three years without\r\nreturning in the interval to England. She wished me to accompany her,\r\nand made a most surprising and unexpected proposition to me.\r\n\r\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie, my own darling, I love you more dearly than ever. It\r\nis true I am considerably older than you, but you are now twenty-five\r\nyears of age, and, therefore, a full grown man. I wish to endow you with\r\nall my great wealth, and I offer you my hand in marriage. Do not suppose\r\nI want to monopolize this dear prick.\xe2\x80\x9d (We were in bed naked, and had\r\njust concluded a most exquisite fuck.) \xe2\x80\x9cNo, with our love of variety we\r\nwill still seek it out, but as husband and wife we can do so with\r\nperfect ease and safety; whereas if not married and travelling together\r\nwe should be compromised at every city we stop at. What say you, my\r\ndarling Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d Here she threw herself on my bosom with loving eyes\r\nupraised to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, beloved of my soul! Why, look how the very idea has raised my\r\nprick to instant life. If anything in the world could delight me more\r\nthan another it is your generous noble offer. To dedicate my life to the\r\nwoman I love more than any other is a joy greater than I can express. I\r\nthank you from my soul, adorable creature as you are. Oh! come to my\r\narms as my future wife and let us revel in the glorious idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the way in which this happiness was conferred on me, which\r\nendured for long years, although, alas, my widowed heart now all\r\nhopelessly ever regrets that most lovable of women and best of wives.\r\nOh, what happiness it was as long as I possessed her.\r\n\r\nWe were married in a few days after this by special license.\r\n\r\nThe Benson and the Egerton were present and Harry Dale was my best man.\r\nWe adjourned to her house, now ours, to breakfast. They also stayed to\r\ndinner and slept at our house, that we might celebrate our marriage with\r\na parting orgy, for we announced to our friends that in marrying, so far\r\nfrom renouncing our orgies, we meant our union to promote ever varying\r\nones, and that on our return we would renew the exquisite ones we had so\r\noften enjoyed with them.\r\n\r\nHarry and I did all we could on that happy occasion to satisfy three of\r\nthe finest women in the world, whose delicious power of fucking was\r\nnever surpassed and rarely equalled.\r\n\r\nOh! we had such a delicious night. As to the women, their amorous\r\ngamahuching of each other was ever renewed, and was most exciting to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast that morning they stopped to see us off, and threw old\r\nslippers after us for luck.\r\n\r\nWe posted down to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s for a day and a night on our way to the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThey were, of course, delighted with my marriage as bringing great\r\nwealth into the family, indeed, my darling presented aunt with a cheque\r\nfor \xc2\xa31000.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale and Ellen came over, and we had another delicious night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norgy, in which all exerted themselves to the utmost.\r\n\r\nWe parted from dear aunt and uncle, Mrs. Dale and Ellen, after luncheon,\r\nand posted down to Dover; slept at Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, where we had our\r\nreal first night\xe2\x80\x99s fucking all to ourselves, enjoyed it in moderation\r\nbut in every endearment that two lovers could devise.\r\n\r\nWe crossed to Calais next day.\r\n\r\nThe sea was smooth at first, but we found it after passing the Foreland\r\nvery rough. My dear wife suffered severely; fortunately I myself never\r\nfelt better, and was thus able to devote every attention to the dear\r\nsufferer. It left her even after we landed with nausea and a severe\r\nheadache, so that night at Devaux\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel we slept each in one of the\r\nseparate beds in the same room, as is usual in French hotels, and indeed\r\nin continental hotels in general.\r\n\r\nMy darling wife was far from feeling well next morning, but fancied that\r\nposting on to Abbeville would rather tend to recovery than otherwise. We\r\naccomplished this easily between breakfast and dinner, found a very\r\ncomfortable hotel with very fair cooking and excellent wines. My wife\r\nenjoyed her dinner, and felt something like herself after it. We slept\r\ntogether by bringing the two beds side by side, but only took a single\r\nfuck before sleeping, and next morning a double one.\r\n\r\nWe spent the day at Abbeville, wandering through its quaint streets and\r\nseeing its fine unfinished cathedral. The following day we posted to\r\nAmiens, visiting its very beautiful cathedral, posted the following day\r\nto Beauvais, again slept, passed next day there, and on the following\r\nday posted up to Paris, and drove to Meurice\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel in the rue de\r\nRivoli.\r\n\r\nWe had previously written for a set of rooms _au premier_, overlooking\r\nthe Tuileries Gardens, with orders to have dinner ready at a given hour.\r\nWe arrived just in time to change our travelling costume and to sit down\r\nto a luxurious dinner. Here, as we had ordered, our bedroom contained a\r\nproper large bed for both to sleep in. This hotel being much used by the\r\nEnglish was furnished with French taste but English comfort.\r\n\r\nThe dilatory manner of our journey, the agreeable breaks we had made at\r\ndifferent interesting towns had quite restored my beloved wife to all\r\nher accustomed health, energy, and lubricity. The comfort of the bed,\r\nthe stimulating cheer, and the excellent wine also nerved me to meet her\r\nutmost lasciviousness, and we had a night such as we used to have when I\r\nfirst had her in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s spare bedroom.\r\n\r\nWe recalled those happy days, and revelled in every lascivious act of\r\nthe hottest lust. My adored wife excelled herself, and I myself was\r\nfully up to the mark; we fucked ourselves to sleep, with prick left\r\nsoaking in her deliciously tightest of cunts, so that on awaking in full\r\ndaylight I found my cock stiff standing in her cunt, which was giving it\r\nmost delicious pressures, quite involuntarily, for the darling was not\r\nyet awake. I roused her by gentle movements, and the frigging of her\r\nlong delicious clitoris, so that she awoke to joys of which we never\r\ntired. On this occasion natural wants compelled a temporary withdrawal\r\nto relieve our distended bladders. We found that it was already past ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, so she smacked my bare bottom and sent me off to my dressing\r\nroom, that both might get ready for breakfast, for which our appetites\r\nwere already craving. I slipt on a dressing-gown, went into our sitting\r\nroom, rang for a waiter, and ordered breakfast to be got ready\r\nimmediately, so that by the time we were dressed it was on the table all\r\nsmoking hot, and we sat down and did full justice to it.\r\n\r\nWe spent several days in visiting the wonders of Paris.\r\n\r\nI had heard of a famous bawd residing at No. 60, rue Richelieu, and\r\nanother, Madame Leriche, in the rue de Marc, where they had rooms, from\r\nwhich, through cleverly arranged peepholes, any operation in the next\r\nroom could be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\nMadame Leriche\xe2\x80\x99s girls were instructed to get the finest men they could\r\nsee in the street, to bring them in, and there to pretend to be so\r\nstruck with their beauty that they would not be content without having\r\nthem quite naked, stripping themselves also. When quite naked they\r\ncaressed their pricks, waltzed round the room, taking care to stop\r\nexactly opposite each hidden opening, and there caress, handle, and show\r\nthe standing prick to any looker-on, eventually fucking in such a\r\nposition as all peepers could fully see and enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe fun of the thing was the perfect unconsciousness of the men as to\r\nthe purpose of all these gyrations. They took it proudly as a homage to\r\ntheir virility, and the power of their charms over their new conquest,\r\nand were doubly lustful in consequence, little imagining it was all a\r\nwell-acted scene, got up for an exhibition to please others, and show\r\nall their virile gifts. Sometimes both man and girl were very\r\nattractive, and I used to fuck my loved Florence while in the act of\r\npeeping.\r\n\r\nThe place where we sat to see was a small narrow room, with just space\r\nfor a couch on one side and two chairs at the end, next to each\r\npeephole. Three other similar narrow rooms looked into the same\r\noperating room.\r\n\r\nOne day we had an exciting fuck from the exhibition of a very fine man\r\nfucking his girl with a splendid prick. We were kneeling on the couch\r\nwith my prick soaking in the quietude of the after-joy. We heard a\r\nscuffling with suppressed bawdy exclamations on the other side of the\r\nthin partition next to us. We, too, had made use of bawdiness. I had\r\nwhispered to Florence how deliciously tight her hairy cunt was, and how\r\nsplendidly her enormous arse moved below my eyes as I fucked her.\r\n\r\nWe now discovered that the couple next to us had overheard us, for we\r\ncould just hear her ask if her arse\xe2\x80\x99s movement and size pleased him as\r\nmuch as their neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my angel, you wriggle your immense arse to perfection, and\r\nyour cunt is almost too tight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen fuck on with your splendid prick as hard as our neighbours were at\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d A happy thought seized me. I put my finger to my lip to give the\r\nhint to Florence, slipped out into the passage and peeped through the\r\nkeyhole, which commanded the whole of the narrow room. I beheld a\r\nhandsome man fucking a superbly stout woman, kneeling with her head down\r\nlow, but towards the door. Her arse uncovered and held aloft was a\r\nremarkably fine one, wriggling indeed to perfection.\r\n\r\nI slipped back, described it to my dear wife, and suggested our speaking\r\nto them through the partition as soon as they were done, to avow that we\r\nhad heard all their goings-on, as they had ours, and to propose that we\r\nshould form a _partie carr\xc3\xa9e_.\r\n\r\nFlorence jumped at the idea, just as their sighs and shaking of their\r\ncouch against the partition announced the grand final crisis.\r\n\r\nWe allowed them some minutes for the after-satisfaction; we then heard\r\nthe lady beg him to do it again as she felt his cock was stiffening\r\nwithin her cunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen your delicious tight cunt is giving me such\r\nexquisite pressures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe thought this a happy moment, as they were both in a state of\r\nlasciviousness; so tapping at the partition, and raising my voice just\r\nsufficient to be clearly heard, I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been following our example, and seem as lustful as we are,\r\nsuppose we join parties and exchange partners. I am sure you must be two\r\ndesirable persons, and you will find us worth knowing. It will be a\r\nnovelty exciting to all, and will lead or not, as it may be, to a\r\nfurther acquaintance or just a momentary caprice. What say you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pause and a whisper was followed by\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cEh! bien, nous acceptons.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to us, for I am half undressed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman.\r\n\r\nWe rose and went in unto them, even in a biblical sense. My slight peep\r\nhad given me an idea of two handsome persons, but a full view proved\r\nthem to be eminently so. He was still up to the hilt from behind. She\r\nlifted her head to look at us on entering, but left her splendid arse\r\nexposed, and did not for the moment alter her position. We handled and\r\npressed it. The gentleman feeling my wife\xe2\x80\x99s arse cried out to his\r\ndearie\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s an arse equal to yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as I stood by her side feeling hers, she slipped her hand\r\ninto my flap, and in answer to his exclamation, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a prick bigger than yours. Oh, I see we shall all be\r\ndelighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose and pulled out my standing prick to show it to her husband, for\r\nlike us they turned out to be a most salacious couple of married people.\r\n\r\nMy wife laid hold of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s prick, and declared it to be a very\r\nfine one, and a delicious variety which was always charming.\r\n\r\nI proposed, as the room and couch could only accommodate one couple,\r\nthat I should take his wife into our room, and leave mine with him, and\r\nas the two couches were close to the partition between, we could excite\r\neach other by our mutual sighs and bawdy exclamations. This was at once\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nWe all of us stripped to the buff; my new companion was magnificently\r\nmade\xe2\x80\x94very much of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s figure, with a splendid arse, although not\r\nso enormously developed as dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s. Her cunt was delicious, a grand\r\nmons Veneris, sweetly haired with silky curls; her pouting cunt had the\r\ntrue odour, and was very tight, and her pressures and action left\r\nnothing to desire.\r\n\r\nI gamahuched her first\xe2\x80\x94her clitoris was well-defined and stiff. Her\r\nbubbies were superb, and stood firmly apart, face charming with lovely\r\nand lovable blue eyes, full of the sparkle of lust; lips red and moist,\r\ninviting a tongue.\r\n\r\nWe indulged in delicious preliminaries; she had a good look at my prick,\r\ndeclared she had thought her husband\xe2\x80\x99s could not be beaten, but admitted\r\nmine was longer and larger. She sucked its head. Then lying back on the\r\ncouch she begged me to mount on her belly, as she liked to commence in\r\nthat pose. I mounted upon her, got my prick gradually up to the crushing\r\nof the two hairs, and then alternately tongueing her sweet mouth or\r\nsucking a nipple of her lovely bosom, ran a most delicious course,\r\nmaking her spend thrice to my once.\r\n\r\nOur other equally occupied couple had evidently got a course ahead of\r\nus, and were changing into the position in which we had first fucked our\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nWe, too, followed in the same attitude, and really the fine arse of my\r\n_fouteuse_, her naturally small waist, seen to perfection in this\r\nposition, and her noble shoulders beyond could hardly be excelled, and\r\nwere most inviting and inciting. I plunged with one fierce thrust up her\r\nreeking cunt, and by the very violence of my attack made her spend on\r\nfinding it up to the cods, giving me at the same time a cunt pressure\r\nalmost equal to my loved wife\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe was so delightful a fucker that I fucked her thrice more before\r\ndrawing out of that exquisite receptacle.\r\n\r\nOn comparing notes afterwards I learnt that my wife\xe2\x80\x99s fucker had just\r\ndone as much, and though not so cunt-satisfying a prick as mine, the\r\nvariety and novelty gave it an extra charm that more than made up for\r\nany diminution of size.\r\n\r\nWe were thus all mutually delighted with our change of partners. An\r\nacquaintance begun so delightfully led to a warm friendship and a\r\nconstant interchange of these most agreeable refinements, including\r\nevery variety of the gamahuche and _la double jouissance_ to all\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nWe all went together to witness some rear-operations between two men,\r\nfor which the old bawd\xe2\x80\x99s house, No. 60, rue de Rivoli, was quietly known\r\nto be the rendezvous. I made a first visit alone to see if it would be\r\nworth our while; had an interview with the old bawd, a bold masculine\r\nwoman of a certain age, who must have been very desirable in her younger\r\nyears, for even now many who frequented her house finished off in her\r\nfully developed charms. Her habit being, as I was told, to come in to\r\nthe man after one of the girls had left him to purify herself, and\r\nherself to lave his prick from mere love and excitement of handling a\r\nprick, and from long practice she had an art of doing it in a way to\r\nraise another perpendicular, which led to its being allayed in the\r\nfull-blown charms of the bawd herself.\r\n\r\nI was shown into her sanctum, and there I told her that I knew she could\r\narrange an exhibition of sodomy. I said that I only wanted to see the\r\noperation, as it appeared to me impossible, and I should like the two\r\nfellows to be well hung and good looking, if such she could procure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the very thing for you under my hand if you care to wait a\r\nquarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs that exactly suited my purpose I said I would.\r\n\r\nShe rose, rang the bell, and when a tap came to the door, went out and\r\ngave some orders. When she came back she said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI have some very\r\nfine girls, all entirely without prejudices, would you like to have one\r\nup? I have them of all ages, from twelve to twenty-five; and also one or\r\ntwo handsome boys to have in company with them, to excite the slower\r\npowers of elderly men or those who like such additions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked her, but told her my only object at present was to see an\r\nactual scene of sodomy. So to occupy me she opened a small cupboard, and\r\ntook out some bawdy books, admirably illustrated. The examination of\r\nthese was exciting; her experienced eye detected the effect in the\r\ndistention of my trousers, the extent of which seemed so to astonish her\r\nthat she laid her hand upon it, gave an exclamation of surprise at its\r\nsize, and said she must see so noble a prick, unbuttoned my trousers,\r\nand pulled it out. She handled it charmingly and looked so lewd that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what might have happened, for I had already slipped a hand up\r\nto an enormous big and hard arse, when a tap came to the door, and a\r\nvoice announced simply that all was ready. This at once recalled me to\r\nmyself, although the bawd would willingly have made me before adjourning\r\nto the other room.\r\n\r\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity not to let me have this magnificent prick into\r\nme. I wish the fellows had not come so soon, I am certain I could have\r\ngot it if we had not been interrupted, and I can tell you you would have\r\nfound me as good a fuck yet as the finest young woman you could meet\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laughed, and to quiet her, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe may have that another time, for\r\nyou are a very fine and desirable woman.\xe2\x80\x9d With this placebo she rose and\r\naccompanied me to the room where the two men awaited us. They were two\r\ntall, good-looking young men, evidently _gar\xc3\xa7ons de caf\xc3\xa9s_, a class much\r\naddicted to this letch, and acting as paid minions to those wanting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey naturally concluded that such was my object. They were already\r\nstript, and both their very fair pricks were nearly at full stand. They\r\neach turned themselves round, and asked which arse I wished to operate\r\non, and which prick was to operate upon me.\r\n\r\nThe old bawd, whose interest it was to induce me to have them, handled\r\ntheir pricks with great gusto, and pointed out the firmness and\r\nattractiveness of their arses, bid me feel how hard they were, as well\r\nas the stiffness of their pricks and the rough crispness of their\r\nballocks.\r\n\r\nI felt them, and would gladly have had them both, but I knew they had an\r\ninfamous habit of _chantage_, that is of denouncing to their gang\r\nwell-to-do men who were got within their meshes, and go where he would\r\nin Europe he was sure to be waited on and money screwed out of him by\r\nthreatening to denounce his practices; so shaking my head and refusing\r\nto let the old bawd pull out my prick, which might then have become too\r\nunruly, I firmly told her she knew I only came there to see what the\r\noperation was like, and had no idea of having my own person handled by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA mutual glance of disappointment was exchanged between the bawd and\r\nthem, but they put themselves at my disposal, and asked which was to be\r\nthe recipient and which the operator. I pointed out the largest prick as\r\nthe operator. They drew a sofa into the best light, and one knelt on it,\r\npresenting a very tempting arsehole to his fellow minion; after\r\nmoistening it and spitting on it, the old bawd, with apparent relish,\r\nguided the prick of the other to the aperture, and it glided with all\r\nease into the well-accustomed receptacle.\r\n\r\nI was seated by their side with my eyes on a level and close to the\r\npoint of junction. A very exciting scene, for he went up to his cods,\r\nand fucked right earnestly while the recipient wriggled his arse to\r\nperfection, and seemed really to enjoy it. They spent with cries of joy\r\nin great delight, it excited me very much, and the observant old bawd\r\ncould see my prick bounding within the confinement of my trousers.\r\n\r\nHoping to overcome my reluctance to take part in the programme, she\r\nstimulated them to change places, and the recipient became the operator,\r\nand the other the recipient. I was awfully lewd, but resisted even that;\r\nafter they had done I gave them a Napoleon apiece in excess of the price\r\npaid to the bawd, and left them to dress, and retired with the bawd to\r\nmake other arrangements.\r\n\r\nOn shutting the door and entering the corridor I perceived at once some\r\ndoors opening upon small rooms adjoining the operating room, I guessed\r\ntheir destination; on attempting to open one the bawd seized my arm in\r\ngreat alarm, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I understand, come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen once more in her sanctum I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you have had peepers\r\nwatching the operations, so it is well I resisted any complicity in the\r\naction, but the discovery that you have the peepholes already simplifies\r\nmy object. I have come here to report upon the effect of this scene of\r\nsodomy. A friend who dares not do as much requires such a stimulant to\r\nenable him to fuck a woman he much desires to have, and who is my\r\nmistress. Now it so happens I want very much to fuck his mistress, and\r\nwe have made a compact that if this scene is likely to excite him, we\r\nare to come to your peepholes, and while he is thus enabled to fuck my\r\nwoman I shall fuck his. I am thus explicit that you may know our real\r\nobject. I suppose that now the witnesses to our operations today have\r\nleft, so let me see the rooms that I may judge how far they will suit\r\nand which will most favour our object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old bawd complied directly, but still longing to have my big prick\r\ninto her, pulled her petticoats up to her navel, showing an enormous\r\nmons Veneris, thickly haired, and turning round a still finer arse,\r\nsaid, would I not like to assuage my excited prick in one or other of\r\nher really splendid attractions.\r\n\r\nI said not at present, thank you. And tightening my trousers over it,\r\nshowed her that it had quite drooped its head, and was no longer in the\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\nShe undertook to raise it very quickly, but I politely declined, on the\r\nplay of want of time, to thoroughly enjoy so splendid a woman.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of disappointment, for the size of my prick had evidently\r\nraised her lewdness to fiery zest, she led the way. Two or three of the\r\npeeping rooms were too small for four, but one was arranged for a\r\n_partie carr\xc3\xa9e_. I made an arrangement for the second day from then, and\r\nrequested, if possible, to have four buggers together, to do it in\r\nvarious positions, and once at least in a chain of three pricks into the\r\narses before them at the same time; I paid in advance half of the high\r\nprice we were to pay, and fixed the hour of one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon, in order to have plenty of daylight to see and thoroughly\r\nenjoy all the excitement.\r\n\r\nI left but allowed the old bawd just on going away to take out my prick\r\nand give it a suck by the way of allaying a little the great desire she\r\nhad for it. She doubtless expected to raise such a heat as would compel\r\nmy passions to satisfy her, but I had now sufficient command of it to\r\nkeep it down.\r\n\r\nOur grand scene of sodomistic encounters took place as arranged, the De\r\nGrandvits, as our new friends were called, and ourselves, with a basket\r\ncontaining two bottles of champagne, biscuits, and glasses, betook\r\nourselves to No. 60, and were installed in the chosen chamber some five\r\nminutes before the arrival of the sodomites. We saw them undress, slap\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arses, and feel each other\xe2\x80\x99s pricks to get them in fighting\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe old bawd was there and lent an effective helping hand where wanted.\r\nThey all declared it would much assist their operations if she would\r\nstrip and let them see her flitting round and aiding in their efforts.\r\n\r\nShe knew herself to be much more attractive in body than face, and\r\ncomplied directly, and really added much to the excitement of the scene.\r\n\r\nThey began by coupling in threes, so that one after the other held the\r\ndelicious position of middle man\xe2\x80\x94be fucked and fucking. The spare fourth\r\nfucking the old bawd, much to her gratification and ours.\r\n\r\nThe first outsider was now placed in the middle, and the previous\r\nrecipient became his attacker in the rear, while the previous\r\nrear-fucker became the recipient of the outsider. The late middle man,\r\ninstead of fucking the bawd, buggered her to her apparent satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis was just what I wanted, for we had not as yet in our _parties\r\ncarr\xc3\xa9es_ with the De Grandvits indulged even in bottom-fucking the\r\nwomen, but this, as we afterwards found, was equally indulged in private\r\nby them as well as ourselves. Now we enjoyed the sight of the old bawd\r\nwriggling in delight with loudly uttered exclamations of pleasure at\r\nhaving her bottom well fucked, for it was the largest prick of the four\r\nand a very fine one that was into her arse.\r\n\r\nWe had already racked off in the cunts of each other\xe2\x80\x99s wives at the\r\nfirst display.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try that,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered my wife to De Grandvit, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears to give\r\nthe old woman vast delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was what De Grandvit had been longing for in his inward soul. At the\r\nproposition of my adored wife his cock sprung into its utmost stiffness.\r\nShe knelt on a chair before a peephole. De Grandvit brought his fine\r\nprick, which he had moistened with his spittle, up to her delicious\r\nhairy arsehole and with very little effort housed it to the hilt.\r\n\r\nAt the whispered wish of my darling Florence he did not press to a rapid\r\nconclusion, but drew the fuck out to a most exciting length, and to an\r\necstatic ending in which they had great difficulty in suppressing\r\nexclamations of the delight afforded.\r\n\r\nI had followed the lead given, the delicious big arsed De Grandvit had,\r\nlike her husband, a long previous wish to be so fucked, and from\r\npractice of that divine coition had no difficulty in taking in with vast\r\npleasure my bigger prick.\r\n\r\nWe both ran two exquisite courses in their delicious arseholes, and\r\nthen separated that all might see the grand finale of the four sodomites\r\neach in the arse before him, and the fourth front man into the immense\r\nand magnificent arse of the old bawd. This ended their exhibition.\r\n\r\nI should add that all in turn had either fucked or buggered the old bawd\r\nto her infinite gratification both in person and nurse for she claimed\r\nafterwards and received a good additional douceur for the extra sight of\r\nher own fine body, naked and in double action.\r\n\r\nWhen they were dressed she got out the liqueur bottle and gave them all\r\na dram and a biscuit. We, too, partook of our champagne and biscuits\r\nwhile discussing the charms of the scenes just witnessed.\r\n\r\nMy darling wife chimed in with the remark of how much more the middle\r\nman had seemed to enjoy it than the two outsiders.\r\n\r\nI added a remark that I had heard that such a position was the _ne plus\r\nultra_ of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why should we not try it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the glorious De Grandvit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho shall begin?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, as the idea of trying it was first\r\nsuggested by his wife, she ought to have her own idea first realised in\r\nher magnificent person. I would fuck her while he went into her arse.\r\n\r\nThis was immediately adopted. I lay down on my back, the delicious De\r\nGrandvit mounted on me, rose and fell, and spent before she stooped on\r\nmy belly and presented her splendid arse to her impatient husband, who\r\nfor some minutes knelt prick in hand behind her. With gentle care and\r\nwell-moistened prick he got housed at last in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s delicious\r\narsehole, and then slowly at first, but more energetically afterwards,\r\nwe ran a most exquisite course.\r\n\r\nAs no one was now in the adjoining chamber, no restraint was put upon\r\nour lascivious exclamations. The De Grandvit was in such a delirium of\r\necstasy that she screamed again and died away in absolute annihilation\r\nof all sense but that of the utmost satisfied lust.\r\n\r\nMy darling wife had straddled across us and been gamahuched deliciously\r\nby De Grandvit while _enculant_ his wife. We next changed the venue; he\r\nfucked my wife while I plunged into her glorious arse; the De Grandvit\r\nstraddled across the others, was gamahuched by me as her husband had\r\ngamahuched my wife. This course, too, was run in an ecstasy of enjoyment\r\nto all concerned, and ended our orgy on that occasion. We arranged our\r\ndresses, finished our champagne, called up the old bawd, satisfied her\r\ndemands, and thanked her for the exciting scene she had procured us. On\r\nasking her, she admitted that the other peeping rooms had been occupied\r\nby couples, and that one elderly gentleman had had two of her page boys\r\nto operate and be operated upon while the scene before him excited him\r\nto the necessary extent to take a part in it himself. He had just left,\r\nhaving stayed to listen to our proceedings and had told her the two\r\ngentlemen had in consequence of the scene witnessed initiated the women\r\ninto the _double jouissance_, and the excitement of listening and\r\nhearing had enabled him once more to get into the handsomest boy, and\r\nhave the other in him.\r\n\r\nShe hinted that we ought to come again, and have the boys in, for she\r\nsaid the gentlemen, that is ourselves, would find an immense additional\r\npleasure in letting the boys penetrate their bottoms while they were\r\ninto their ladies in both apertures.\r\n\r\nWe laughed, and said we should consider her offer, but for the present\r\nwe were fucked out.\r\n\r\nWe did not forget the bawd\xe2\x80\x99s proposal of having a boy to fuck us while\r\n_enculant_ the dear women. A hint to my darling wife brought this out at\r\nour next meeting. After the dear creatures had both enjoyed the _double\r\njouissance_, my wife said to Madame De Grandvit\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are really quite selfish, here are our two loved husbands giving us\r\nthe unutterable joys of the double junction, and yet not enjoying it\r\nthemselves. You remember how the old woman at No. 60 spoke of the\r\nraptures the addition of her boys would be to the bottoms of our\r\nhusbands while administering the double coition to us. Why should they\r\nnot try the same on themselves, and give us the delight of seeing them\r\nin all the ecstasies their double embrace confers upon us? We know how\r\nthey delight in being postillioned, which shows how much they would like\r\nthe real thing if they dared avow it. It is for us to break down the\r\nbarriers of prejudice and false shame. Here, Charlie, let me dedicate\r\nyour bottom to the lust of our dear friend De Grandvit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy beloved wife was at the moment handling the prick of De Grandvit, and\r\nwhose full-standing stiffness showed he was ready to face any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nI pretended a fear of its size being too great to allow of entrance into\r\nthat narrow path of bliss without great pain to the recipient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can never know that till you try,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my darling wife.\r\n\r\nIn all this she was only acting a part prompted by myself, for I was\r\nmost anxious not only to have De Grandvit into my own arse, but was\r\nlonging to be into his great, coarse, hairy, corrugated deep-brown\r\narsehole. In this I differed greatly from our dear friend MacCallum, who\r\nloved the delicate unfledged arseholes of youths, while to me it was\r\nnecessary to be the very reverse of the fair sex, whose arseholes in\r\ngeneral are of a delicate pink with puckered-up charming little\r\norifices, which, of course, have their charm; but when with men to me it\r\nwas twice as exciting to find them like my dear friend the Count\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nquite contrary to those of the fair sex. Dark-brown, roughly corrugated,\r\nand coarse hairs all round them were the arseholes that raised all my\r\nlust, and made sodomy a delicious contrast to merely fucking the\r\narseholes of women; such an arsehole as I most loved to fuck was M. De\r\nGrandvit\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nI had suggested to my wife to tempt him with mine for the sole object of\r\ngetting into his. He bit at the bait, so I shoved my prick into his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s arse, my wife conducted his prick into my delighted bottom. I\r\nmade some affected grimaces, but of course took him in with the greatest\r\nease. My darling wife had acted postillion to him, and had frigged his\r\nwife with her other hand, so we ran a delicious course of the wildest\r\nlust.\r\n\r\nAs we had already served out our wives too many fucks one trial was\r\nsufficient for the moment. De Grandvit was in ecstasies at the delight I\r\nhad afforded him, especially as he appeared to be revenging the affront\r\nI gave to him by being into his wife _in culo_.\r\n\r\nMy adored wife, with her happy art of handling and exciting a prick,\r\nnonetheless willingly that she was getting it up to go into her own\r\nhungry and delicious arsehole, soon brought De Grandvit to the necessary\r\nstiffness.\r\n\r\nI wanted no other stimulant than the expected satisfaction of a letch I\r\nhad long had to be into his fine, rough, hairy arsehole. As soon as he\r\nwas fairly hilted in my adored wife\xe2\x80\x99s splendid bottom, his better half\r\ntook my prick in hand, put it into her mouth to suck and moisten it, and\r\nthen guided it into that narrow abode of bliss I so longed to possess.\r\nIt really was the first time De Grandvit\xe2\x80\x99s arsehole had ever been\r\npenetrated by a prick, although he had long wished for such an\r\nexperience; there was therefore some real grimacing, for mine was not a\r\nprick of the ordinary dimensions, that might penetrate any arsehole, but\r\na prick of the biggest, so I was obliged to be very gentle and make\r\nfrequent halts.\r\n\r\nMy darling wife was obliged to exert all her delicious means of keeping\r\nhis fine prick in her arse at full stand by cunt pressures and her\r\ndelicate handling of his ballocks; at last I was fully engulphed, and\r\npausing until all strange feelings had subsided, a gentle movement and\r\nmy darling wife\xe2\x80\x99s admirable seconding enabled us to end the course in\r\nthe wildest ecstasies of the most delicious delight, and to sink on the\r\nbroad back of my splendid wife, completely annihilated by the most\r\nexquisite joys of satiated lust.\r\n\r\nOnce this delicious practice had been indulged in, you may be sure it\r\ndid not end with a single experience, but as thereafter the _bonne\r\nbouche_ or finish of all our after-orgies.\r\n\r\nMy beloved wife, whose eye for a capable man was infallible, had\r\nobserved a genteel, tall, good-looking young German waiter in the hotel,\r\nwho looked superior to his place. He turned out to be the son of a\r\nwealthy hotel proprietor at Frankfort, who had sent his son to Meurice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin a sort of apprenticeship, to learn how a large Parisian hotel was\r\nmanaged. In such a situation they receive no wages and have even in\r\ngeneral to pay a premium for the privilege\xe2\x80\x94this practice, which is\r\ngeneral with German innkeepers, accounts for the number of\r\ngenteel-looking waiters that are met with in the large hotels of great\r\ncapitals, and who are found to be of superior education and information\r\nwhen spoken to in a friendly and familiar manner.\r\n\r\nThis was eminently the case with our friend Carl. My wife had taken\r\nrather a fancy to him, not at first erotic, but observing that after she\r\nhad talked to him familiarly that he began to be very deferential to her\r\nand with a certain manner that she, with the instinct of a woman, saw at\r\nonce arose from amorous admiration. Casting her eye downwards she\r\ndetected the effect produced in his trousers whenever she was kindly\r\ncivil to him. She increased her familiar conversation, which evidently\r\nallayed any fear he might have had, and she could soon see by the\r\nincreased bulging out of his trousers, not only that he was growing more\r\nlewd upon her, but that he was evidently very well furnished.\r\n\r\nLearning that he was the son of a wealthy father, well educated, only\r\nnow placed in the position of a servant, in order to know, by obeying,\r\nhow to command, and also to gain the experience which large and\r\nwell-frequented hotels alone could teach how best to conduct his own\r\nhotel hereafter.\r\n\r\nShe told me all about it, and thought he might be moulded to our\r\npurposes. Even if not she had taken a caprice to him so that in any case\r\nit would be a gratification to her to possess him.\r\n\r\nSo I lent myself to aid her by purposely absenting myself either at\r\nbreakfast or luncheon, under pretext of going to take one or the other\r\nwith bachelor friends.\r\n\r\nAs Carl was told off to especially attend upon us, and no other servant\r\never came near unless rung for, my wife had easy opportunity, and with\r\nher practised skill in seduction, had him into her on the second day.\r\n\r\nHe proved an admirable stallion; grew passionately lewd on the splendid\r\nperson of my wife, and became in fact cunt-struck upon her, probably the\r\nstrongest bond that can entangle a man. It becomes an infatuation that\r\nmakes him the slave of the cunt that has attracted him. There are few\r\nmen of hot temperament who have not experienced this overmastering\r\ninfatuation, and they know that even supposing the object becomes\r\nperfectly unworthy, unfaithful, abusive, and with every vice indulged\r\nopenly before them, they may wince, they may thoroughly despise her, but\r\nthe chain holds them fast in adamantine bonds, which neither the\r\npersuasion of friends nor their own knowledge of the perfect\r\nunworthiness of the object can tear asunder.\r\n\r\nSuch became the fate of Carl, and my wife moulded him, with all her wily\r\nskill, to our lascivious purposes. When once under her enchantment, I\r\nmade a run over to England on some urgent matters\xe2\x80\x94purposely leaving the\r\nfield open\xe2\x80\x94my wife completed her conquest, had had him in every way, had\r\npostillioned him, and wormed out of him that at college he had indulged\r\nin sodomitical practices with young students like himself; but knowing\r\nhow prejudicial it would be to him in his profession, he had weaned\r\nhimself from the habit with men, but dearly loved the _enculage_ with\r\nwomen, and doubly adored my wife when he found her extraordinary and\r\nexquisite talent in that way. She also, after much apparent hesitation,\r\nin answer to his eager and continual questioning, omitted that her\r\nhusband was much addicted to worshipping her bottom, and had taught her\r\nits divine use. She even cautioned him against any imprudence on my\r\nreturn, for she said she had her suspicions that I had a letch for men,\r\nand if I discovered their liaison, would be apt to avenge myself that\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if he would still allow me to possess your enchanting person he\r\nmight make what use he pleased of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the point aimed at from the beginning. My wife wrote to me, and\r\nwe arranged that I should announce my return for a certain morning, and\r\nthat she should have Carl to sleep with her the previous night.\r\n\r\nI arrived in the middle of the night, walked into the room, found him in\r\nbed, played the angry husband, swore I must have revenge, and that as he\r\nhad cuckolded me I must avenge the affront in being into his person.\r\n\r\nHe objected, for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but said he would yield to anything if I\r\nwould not drive him away from the adorable Madame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will depend upon the manner in which you satisfy my desires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do what you like, dear sir, if only you will allow me to love\r\nMadame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see, we shall see; let me look at your prick. Oh, a good size,\r\neven when down. Let me see it at full stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy wife here interfered, and said Carl was so good that she was sure he\r\nwould prove a satisfaction to me. She took his prick in hand, and with\r\nher art of handling a prick, had it at full stand in a minute and asked\r\nme if she could possibly have refused so handsome a prick as that. And,\r\nindeed, it was a very fine one.\r\n\r\nCarl was a very fair young man, with a most beautiful and satiny skin.\r\nHis prick was exquisitely white, and the blue veins showed themselves\r\ncoursing through in a most tempting way\xe2\x80\x94it was seven and a half inches\r\nlong, by quite six in circumference, was thick up to the vermilion nut,\r\nalthough gently diminishing from the roots, the glans was smaller than\r\nthe shaft close up to it; a hollow, like what you sometimes see in the\r\nneck of a bottle, ran all round the edge of the nut, and thus made it a\r\nhead to the shaft. My wife declared that its shape gave her great\r\npleasure in both orifices. It certainly was a very attractive prick, and\r\nnow that it was at full stand I made him lie on his back on the bed,\r\ntook it in my mouth, sucked and frigged it until he spent in an agony of\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nI then made him turn over on his belly, that I might admire his\r\nivory-like buttocks, which I caressed and kissed in every way. My wife\r\nslipping her hand under his belly soon recovered the stiffness of his\r\nprick. I now desired him to kneel that I might be into his bottom.\r\n\r\nHis exquisitely white buttocks, marble-like in polish, hardness, and\r\ncoldness to the touch, were most attractive to women as well as to me.\r\n\r\nWhile thus kneeling with head low, and the chink between the buttocks\r\nwell spread open, his exquisite small, pink, corrugated arsehole with\r\nalmost invisible fair, short ringlets around it was truly lovely and\r\nexciting.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, I like to fuck a rough, hairy-arsed man, but I can all the\r\nsame appreciate the delight in such an exquisite arsehole as Carl\r\npossessed. To me also it had the attraction of its first possession.\r\nWhen thus first fully displayed to my delighted eye, I flung myself on\r\nmy knees, kissed and tongued the exquisite and delicious orifice, and\r\nspeedily got furiously lewd upon it; and rarely have I fucked an arse\r\nmore deliciously incentive to sodomy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d cried my wife, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must let this fine object (his\r\nprick) be housed in me first, and then he will less feel the\r\nintroduction of your large instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI immediately consented, on which he cried out in delight\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh do what you like with me, as long as your adorable lady will permit\r\nme to possess her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9csee, her cunt is reeking with your spunk, so I will\r\nfirst bathe my prick therein, to make it go easier into your arse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe took up kneeling positions. He filled the delighted cunt of my wife,\r\nand presented his really beautiful arse to my raging lust. I humoured\r\nthe entrance a little, but once within over the nut, I plunged\r\nrecklessly forward, somewhat too roughly, for it made him wince, and he\r\nwould have escaped from me if he had not been doubly imprisoned. The\r\npause I gave him after being fully engulphed calmed the strange\r\nsensation, and we gradually increased our movements until both died away\r\nin excessive delight, especially to him, for it was his first experience\r\nof _la double jouissance_, and it gave him such exquisite enjoyment that\r\nhe begged me not to withdraw, but to run a second course. My darling\r\nwife thinking it would increase his lewdness if she changed his prick\r\nfrom her cunt to the more divine orifice, withdrew it, and placed it in\r\nthe grove sacred to the secret rites of Priapus.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed the ecstasies of paradise on this last occasion, and we all\r\nfell on the bed completely overcome by the soul-killing joys of the\r\ndischarge, and lay soaking in all the after-pleasure for some time,\r\nuntil my darling wife begged us to relieve her of our overpowering\r\nweight. We rose and purified ourselves, and then I posed him standing\r\nup, admiring the really fine proportions and beauty of his handsome fair\r\nform. I sucked his prick until it stood, and then told him he must give\r\nme the pleasures of the middle, which he was so highly praising as the\r\nutmost exquisite enjoyment he had ever experienced.\r\n\r\nMy darling wife was delighted. She got on her knees. I entered her\r\ndelicious cunt in the first bout, and I quickly housed Carl\xe2\x80\x99s prick in\r\nmy arse.\r\n\r\nWe ran an exquisite course, and then a second with only a change of my\r\nprick to Florence\xe2\x80\x99s arse instead of cunt. Carl was after this obliged to\r\nleave us, as the morning was getting on.\r\n\r\nI sent him away the happiest of men by telling him as long as he placed\r\nhis arse at my disposal, he should have my wife always at the same time.\r\n\r\nThus we had secured another fine prick to our general orgies. We told\r\nthe Grandvits of our fortunate _trouvaille_.\r\n\r\nMonsieur made some difficulty about his being a servant, and the fear of\r\ndiscovery of our orgies through his indiscretion; but hearing that he\r\nwas much superior to a servant he consented to his introduction.\r\n\r\nAfter they had seen and admired him, they expressed their extreme\r\nsatisfaction at the result of his joining us\xe2\x80\x94for both Madame and\r\nGrandvit loved to have him into all their orifices. We could now fuck\r\nboth women at once, and the double pleasure could be given to either sex\r\nwithout there being any outsider.\r\n\r\nEvery third night they slept in our hotel, and that night we never\r\nceased conjunctions in every variety, with pauses for refreshment,\r\npurification, pleasant bawdy talk, fun, and frolic. For a month longer\r\nthis delicious existence lasted, and then it was time for us to proceed\r\nsouthward. We parted from the Grandvits with much regret, but promised\r\nto return in the spring and visit them at their country house. I may\r\nhere add that we did so, and enjoyed our visit to the utmost; and, in\r\nthe second year of our absence, they accompanied us into Germany, where\r\nat last we left dear Carl. He had begged us to let him go as my valet\r\nwith us to Italy.\r\n\r\nHis intended stay in Paris was within a month of its termination; he\r\nwrote to his father that the opportunity of travelling through Italy\r\nunder the offer we had made was too advantageous to be lost. His father\r\nconsented, and thus for eighteen months he was our constant companion\r\nand participator in all our lascivious conjunctions.\r\n\r\nCarl accompanied us to London on our first return home, and resided with\r\nus for three months. I told the Benson and the Egerton of our good\r\nfortune in discovering him, and the exquisite addition to our party of\r\nus and the De Grandvits he had been.\r\n\r\nThey were instantly alive to the delight of possessing him.\r\n\r\nI had continued the occupation of my chambers in the Temple, in which\r\nHarry Dale still resided; it was there we erected our altar to the\r\nApostrophian Venus, and held our orgies.\r\n\r\nCarl delighted our old friends, who were never tired of having him one\r\nway or another, while Harry or I administered to the _double\r\njouissance_.\r\n\r\nA new prick to a woman is like a fresh cunt to a man, and for the time\r\ngives additional zest to the lust which rages in us. So it is with the\r\ndarling Benson and the lovely Egerton. They revelled in the possession\r\nof Carl. They knew they could only have him but a short time, and they\r\nmade the most of him.\r\n\r\nMy beloved wife, with that kindly consideration for everyone which\r\ndistinguished her, quite abandoned Carl to these two dear insatiable\r\ncunts, and contented herself with presiding over our orgies, dictating\r\nnew and exciting poses to our two friends, leaving Carl and me to their\r\nembraces, and consoling herself with a fuck now and then from Harry\r\nDale, when we two were simply fucking each his dame. She told them, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan have Carl and Charlie whenever I like at home, so must leave them to\r\nyou for the three months that Carl can only give us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe met thrice a week. My wife used to drive to the dear creatures and\r\ntake them up, the husbands being much gratified at the affection shown\r\nby my wife to them, and never having the slightest suspicion of the\r\nobject my wife had in taking them out. As to our own servants they knew\r\nthe chambers belonged to their master, and they knew we lunched there,\r\nbut they never imagined their mistress would take ladies to share in\r\ntheir master\xe2\x80\x99s embraces. So that we carried on our intrigue in perfect\r\nsafety and impunity.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad day when we left with Carl, who never again returned to\r\nEngland. Our darling companions had become much attached to him, and\r\nparted with close embraces, and with bitter tears bade him adieu.\r\n\r\nWe parted from him at Frankfort, where his father, retiring to a country\r\nlife, left him proprietor of a capital hotel, to which in after-years we\r\noften resorted when going to and from the German spas, and always stayed\r\nsome days to renew the orgies we all so loved. His love for my adored\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s cunt endured for ten or twelve years, when an advantageous\r\nmarriage softened it, perhaps more through the jealousy of his wife who,\r\nsuspecting, caused us to desist from using his hotel. He had also got a\r\nfamily of a boy and two girls growing up, which completely ended our\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nTo return to the time of our conducting him to Frankfort with the\r\nGrandvits, they afterwards accompanied us in a tour in Switzerland, but\r\nleft us at Sion, when we turned our steps across the Simplon to Italy.\r\n\r\nWe were invited by our friend the Count to visit him for a month at his\r\nold castle in the hills of San Giovanni, overlooking all the ground of\r\nBonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s earlier battles in his first Italian campaign.\r\n\r\nWe followed the right bank of Lake Maggiore to Arona and Allessandria,\r\nand thence by Acqui gained the castle of the Count on the hill above. It\r\nwas situated in the midst of glorious scenery. From the summit of a hill\r\nnear the glorious line of the Alps could be seen Monte Rosa, Mont Blanc,\r\nMont Cenis, Monte Giovi, and thence round the Apennines, while the Gap\r\nleading to Savona gave a view of the sea, the southern suburb of Genoa,\r\nand the line of coast leading to Spezia.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious view, and we often directed our steps to the summit\r\nfrom whence it was seen during our month\xe2\x80\x99s stay with our loved and\r\ndelightful host.\r\n\r\nHis old castle was only partially ruinous, but quite habitable. However,\r\nhis father had built a comfortable house in the garden, at the base of\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nThe castle crowned a perfect perpendicular detached mass of rock, half\r\nround which rushed a mountain torrent, the approach being a very steep\r\nzigzag with now ruinous defences, a very steep and difficult ascent. It\r\nis true from a low entranced cave at the foot a secret stair led up from\r\nthe garden, of which I shall have more to say in relating some incidents\r\nof the Count\xe2\x80\x99s earlier history, as confessed to us in our close and\r\nintimate intercourse.\r\n\r\nWe were warmly welcomed by our dear friend, who, leading us to our\r\nrooms, had a rack-off of his waste steam in the ever delicious cunt of\r\nmy loved wife, who, it will be recollected, had a great penchant for the\r\nCount, when she used to prefer him at our Percy Street orgies. When the\r\nCount retired, I plunged my excited prick into the balmy bath he had\r\nprepared for me in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s cunt, fucking her fast and furiously the\r\ninstant he retired, a change she loved above all things; this calmed us\r\nfor the moment, and enabled our waiting for night.\r\n\r\nWe had expected to find a young sister of the Count with him but at our\r\norgy at night he told us that since his return home he had had this\r\nsister, and that in fact at that moment she was staying with an\r\n_accoucheuse_ at Turin, and he expected to hear of her delivery by every\r\npost. We congratulated him on finding so delicious a bit of incest to\r\nhis hand on his return to his country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit is much more delicious than you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, how is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is my own daughter as well as sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a delicious idea!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a cockstand, and what a fuck it\r\nmust have been to you! But you must have had your own mother to bring\r\nabout such a delicious result. Do let us hear all about it, my dear\r\nCount, it will excite us all to renewed efforts, as incest always does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis conversation occurred during a long pause we had made in our first\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s orgy when quietly seated after purification, restoring our\r\npowers with Champagne and some slight refreshments prepared by our host\r\nfor the occasion. We had already had three hours of the most delicious\r\nfucking in every possible combination, being all, especially the Count,\r\nfresh and in excellent order for a thorough excess. So we all were glad\r\nof a respite, and listened to the exciting story of the Count\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelicious double incest. As we did not hear all at that sitting, I will\r\nfinish an account of our doings, and then give a connected narrative or\r\nsketch of that strange intrigue, and some other of his earlier\r\nescapades, merely adding that his account of his affair with his mother\r\nset us all off in such an excitement of lust, followed by such an excess\r\nof fucking in bouts of _double jouissance_, in which not only my adored\r\nand most lascivious wife came in for her full share, but both the Count\r\nand myself enjoyed the double bliss in our turn. We carried on to such\r\nan excess that we were quite knocked up, and were so overpowered with\r\nsleep the next evening that by common consent we quietly went to bed,\r\nand deferred till morning any fresh deeds in the fields of love and\r\nlust.\r\n\r\nWe found this so refreshing to our powers of fucking that we regularly\r\nadopted the system of lying fallow the earlier portion of every other\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWe passed a most agreeable time with walks and rides through the lovely\r\nscenery, and explorations of the old castles.\r\n\r\nThe Count himself had two, but the one immediately above his house was\r\nby far the most interesting and was the original seat of his ancestors,\r\nwild robber barons of their day; and a black deed was reported in the\r\ntraditions of the peasantry around.\r\n\r\nThe castle, although in a valley between the hills, stood on a high\r\nperpendicular isolated rock some hundred and fifty feet above its base;\r\nit was crowned with a very high building to make up for want of space at\r\nthe foundation, and had besides a very lofty and bold round tower,\r\nrising high enough above the sides of the valley to serve as a lookout\r\nbeyond them. The habitable part was reached from the main gate by a\r\nsteep stair, at one of the landings was a trap door opening upon a\r\nprofoundly deep shaft; tradition said that this was a trap for personal\r\nenemies, who, on pretence of reconciliation were invited to the castle;\r\non passing over the trap it opened, and they were precipitated to the\r\nbottom. It was the common tradition of the peasantry that wheels with\r\nscythes attached chopped them to pieces at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, and one showing how tradition may preserve a truth\r\nwhere least expected. Our friend the Count for six months lay hidden in\r\nthe secret recesses of this old castle at the time a price was set on\r\nhis head for treason. This had led him to all sorts of explorations, in\r\nwhich he had discovered many hiding places.\r\n\r\nKnowing of this tradition about the cutting up of bodies at the bottom\r\nof this deep shaft he got his two younger brothers to let him down by a\r\nlong cord, and really found the remains of machinery and wheels with\r\nrusty blades attached.\r\n\r\nAfter he had finally escaped, a more regular search was made, and it was\r\ndiscovered that a communication with the torrent on a former higher\r\nlevel had let the water pass underneath the castle, and turn a water\r\nwheel which cut up the bodies and made them float away by the outlet.\r\nHuman skulls and bones were found, singularly verifying the truth of\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nAt the time the Count was a fugitive hiding therein, the old apartments\r\nwere used as a granary to store the rent in kind of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntenantry. As there were suspicions of his having taken refuge here, the\r\nplace had been two or three times ransacked by the police without their\r\ndiscovering him\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the ingenious hiding places he had discovered.\r\nBut for this very reason every precaution had to be taken, and no beds,\r\nbedding, or plates, knives, chairs, or tables were there; he slept on\r\nthe corn, spread three feet thick on the floor, or sat on it when tired.\r\nHis mother, with provisions under her petticoats, would saunter in the\r\ngarden, and, when unobserved, slip into the low cavern and ascend by the\r\nsecret stairs, and seated on the corn by his side, would wait until he\r\nhad done, to take everything away, and leave not a trace of anyone being\r\nprovisioned up there. These details are explanatory of what follows. The\r\nCount had been one of the Royal Guard for two years at Turin, and being\r\na handsome young fellow, had as much fucking at command as he could wish\r\nfor. When shut up for months in his asylum the passions that had been\r\nkept under by constant gratification began to torment him; from the\r\nloopholes of the castle he could see the peasant women working on the\r\nmountainside, and, in stooping, showing their legs even up to the bare\r\nskin, and this used to drive him mad with desire. He did not frig\r\nhimself, but at night stole down to the garden, secured a large pumpkin\r\nor two, took them up to his retreat, cut small holes in their sides, and\r\nthen thrust his stiff-standing prick into them, forcing the hole to the\r\nsize of his prick, and then working the pumpkin with both hands till he\r\nspent deliciously; he used to get six or seven fucks in these artificial\r\ncunts, then throw away the finished one on the torrent side of the\r\ncastle. This was so far a relief, but his lust grew fiercer every day,\r\nand on one occasion became uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nHis mother, who had married at fifteen, was now a fine ripe woman in her\r\nthirty-sixth year. One day, after setting down the things she had\r\nbrought up, she lifted her outer gown that she might not show she had\r\nbeen sitting on corn; the Count was already seated much below her body\r\non the low corn. His mother accidentally on this occasion drew up all\r\nher clothes, showing the whole of her fine arse, and in stooping\r\nbackwards to seat herself all her fine hairy and gaping cunt was visible\r\nto his lower sight. This was too much for the Count, in a moment his\r\nprick sprang to the fiercest stand, he instantly unbuttoned his\r\ntrousers; his mother finding she had brought her bare arse onto the\r\ncorn, leant over on the side opposite to her son to tuck her petticoats\r\nunder her arse, but the Count seized her round the waist with one arm,\r\nwith his body pressed on her already bent body, forced her quite down on\r\nher side and was into her cunt up to the hilt, he thrust it up so\r\nfiercely as not only to make her shriek with surprise, but also with\r\npain. She struggled to be free, but was held down with all the energy of\r\nhis ferocious lust. Very few thrusts in and out were required to bring\r\ndown the first rush of his sperm; this lubricated her cunt, his prick\r\nnever yielded, but stood as stiff as ever, and with hardly an instant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npause he recommenced a more delicious action than the previous one. His\r\nmother, however, was much distressed in mind at the first horror of the\r\nincest, but being a ripe woman of hot lubricity, could not feel a fine\r\nprick deliciously belabouring her cunt without having her lust excited\r\nin spite of herself. As all pain of the unprepared forcing of her cunt\r\nhad passed away, and the plentiful rush of her son\xe2\x80\x99s spunk lubricated\r\nall the passage, she soon could not control her passions, and seconded\r\nhim with an art which left nothing to desire. His long deprivation fired\r\nhim to unusual efforts, and he fucked her five times before he withdrew.\r\n\r\nWhen she sat up she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Ferdinand, what have you done! How could\r\nyou do so? Violate your own mother. It is dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor Count, seeing her much distressed, burst into tears, threw his\r\narms round her neck, and weeping told her he could not help it.\r\n\r\nShe patted his head, and said. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this he lifted his head to kiss her. She, too, wept, and they mingled\r\ntears and caresses together; this almost instantly restored his prick to\r\nits pristine stiffness. He bent his mother back on the corn, and\r\nalthough she resisted a little, and said it was too dreadful his wanting\r\nto commit such a sin again, she opened her legs when he got over her,\r\nand did not prevent his pulling up her petticoats.\r\n\r\nHe was into her this-time-well-moistened and really longing cunt, for\r\nher passions were now become lascivious.\r\n\r\nThrice more did he fuck her, each time more delicious than the others,\r\nand in all seconded by the most splendid action of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arse,\r\nand the most exciting pressures of the inner folds of her really\r\ndelicious cunt.\r\n\r\nAt last she left him, but after so delightful a commencement every day\r\nsaw a renewal of these delicious encounters.\r\n\r\nHis mother proved an adept in every resource of lust. Being a splendidly\r\nmade woman, and salacious in the extreme, when once she had given way to\r\nher lubricity, she indulged in every whim of lust. She always, after a\r\nfew days\xe2\x80\x99 fucking, came very lightly dressed, with no stays or other\r\nencumbrances, so that they used to strip and fuck at ease in every way.\r\nThe Count assured us that much as he had since enjoyed some of the\r\nfinest women, never had one given greater pleasure than his delicious,\r\nlewd, and salacious mother, doubtless the fact of it being incest added\r\nto the usual gratification given by a ripe, well-made, luscious-cunted\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAfter the first week of their delicious encounters, his mother said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Ferdinand, we are very imprudent, you may get me with\r\nchild if we do not adopt precautions. Your father does not wish to have\r\nany more children, and takes care not to get them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he prevent it, my dear mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell dearest, he goes slowly to work, and while he has it in me rubs\r\nhis finger on the point where you are now feeling (he was gently rubbing\r\nup her clitoris, a well-developed one) until he has made me enjoy it\r\nseveral times, and when he finds he is about to discharge he suddenly\r\nwithdraws it, and pushes the head of it into my bottom and spends there.\r\nYou must do the same, but you must not put all this long thick fellow\r\nin. Oh! come to my arms, my son, you have excited me until I must have\r\nit immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon which the Count mounted and fucked so deliciously that with arms\r\nand legs round his body and loins, devil a bit would she allow him to\r\nwithdraw, but spent with him most ecstatically, and quickly called for\r\nmore, so that it was not until the third time of his being about to\r\nspend, that throwing her fine legs high in the air, and bringing her\r\narse with a heave well up, and taking his prick out with her hand, she\r\nguided it to the delicious smaller orifice, and as all was reeking with\r\nthe previous discharge, slipped it in, not the head only, but the whole\r\nshaft. She cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cNot so far, not so far,\xe2\x80\x9d but as he began shoving\r\nin and out she quickly got excited, and wriggled her arse with all her\r\naccustomed skill, and spent deliciously again as he shot his spunk right\r\nup into her incestuous entrails.\r\n\r\nHe passed a hand between their bodies to press a finger on her clitoris,\r\nthis made her cunt throb, which was felt by his prick, and quickly sent\r\nhim up upon another delicious enjoyment of the tight recess of obscene\r\nlust, and a second most exquisite and luscious course was run, equally\r\nto his mother\xe2\x80\x99s as to his satisfaction. Then he withdrew to relieve her\r\nbody of the weight she had so long sustained, they mutually embraced\r\ntheir naked bodies, and sweetly conversed on the exquisite joys they had\r\njust participated in. His mother declared his father gave her nothing\r\nlike the lascivious joys she received from his dear son. They toyed and\r\nkissed until, handling his prick with skill, she got two more delicious\r\nfucks, one in each receptacle, and parted for the day.\r\n\r\nBy the second month she discovered that what she dreaded had happened.\r\nHer son had got her with child; she wept when she communicated this\r\nunfortunate result, but the Count, like me, always stood fiercely at a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s tears. Several splendid fucks followed, all in the cunt\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmischief was done, and precautions were no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nHis mother abandoned herself to him with a greater excess of lust than\r\nshe had ever yet done, and fucked with an excellence, vigour, and energy\r\nthat drew from him eight discharges in a wonderfully short time. The\r\nfact of his having put a baby into her appeared to stimulate both their\r\npassions. She declared she never in her life had enjoyed fucking more.\r\nThey used the grossest bawdy terms in their intercourse, as if it was\r\none barrier more broken down between them, and made their incestuous\r\nlove more exciting and a greater destruction of all natural ties between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBefore parting they consulted about how best to fix the parentage on her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of fifty-five, and, therefore, past the ardour of\r\npassion\xe2\x80\x94taking even his fucking coolly\xe2\x80\x94and, therefore, more difficult to\r\nhoodwink.\r\n\r\nShe knew that he awoke with a cockstand, although that did not always\r\nlead to a fuck. Upon this they founded their hopes, and at last arranged\r\nshe should drug his coffee, and when still asleep in the morning she\r\nshould handle his prick, get him up, turn her bum, put it into her cunt,\r\nwork him gently, make him spend which would awake him, hold him in,\r\npretend she herself was in the acme of delight, but on coming to her\r\nsenses, upbraid him with having spent inside.\r\n\r\nThis all happened as planned, he did awake on spending, but his wife\r\nexerted such unusually delicious pressures upon his delighted prick,\r\nthat he got so excited as to fuck her and she took care he should spend\r\ninside a second time\xe2\x80\x94she pretended to be carried away by passion as much\r\nas he was. But remonstrating afterwards upon the imprudence of what he\r\nhad done, especially in having so excited her that she could not help\r\nspending at the instant he did, which made it more dangerous. She did\r\nnot know how it was but she had never before seemed to receive such\r\npleasure from him as he had given her that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my darling, it is a curious coincidence, but you never seemed to\r\nme more delicious or more lasciviously excellent in your fucking than\r\nyou did just now. As it is but once let us take more care in future, and\r\nhope nothing will come of this little and delightful imprudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut of course there did, as the Count related to us, and seven months\r\nafter this morning fucking my mother gave birth to a daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cI had\r\nalready been in exile for five months when this event came off, I had\r\nletters from my mother after she got about and for some years\r\nafterwards, telling me that my sister was a beautiful child, and growing\r\nup _the image of her father_, underlining those words for me, to put the\r\ntrue construction on them. Poor darling mamma, she died four years ago,\r\nand my father followed her two years later. I never saw either of them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I escaped from Italy I had passed five months in the constant\r\npossession of my beloved mother. As her pregnancy advanced her salacious\r\navidity for my embraces seemed to increase. She was insatiable, but with\r\nsuch variety of charm and art that I never failed to answer to her call.\r\nEvery refinement and excess of the wildest and grossest lust was\r\npractised by us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father possessed a small collection of the grossest bawdy books; my\r\nadored and salacious mother purloined from time to time the lewdest, we\r\nread and excited ourselves in the realisation of the wildest and\r\ngrossest scenes therein depicted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was an instance of a woman getting once out of bounds and\r\nthen stopping short of no excess, and became boundlessly corrupt. There\r\nwas no horror we two could possibly commit that we did not indulge in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, when once the pregnancy was undoubted, was less reticent of\r\nhis fucks. My mother at my request used to stimulate him to fuck her\r\njust before coming up to me, so that I used to shove my prick into the\r\npaternal sperm, sometimes in her cunt, and sometimes in her arse, and\r\neventually used to lick it up before fucking her either way. The incest\r\nof her son upon the immediate fuck of her husband was, she said, the\r\nmost stimulating to her excessive lust of anything I could possibly do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was obliged to go to Turin for ten days; it was the time of\r\nnew moon, when nights were dark. My mother used to put on a dark cloak\r\nand come up to me; we lay down on her cloak, and, stark naked, gave\r\nourselves up to the wildest lust until dawn, when mother slipt away to\r\nthe house and left me well inclined to sleep until she returned with my\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it was a happy time, its combinations of solitude and incest,\r\ncombined with my lusty youth, for I was only nineteen years old at that\r\ntime, made me be constantly at her call, and she never went away before\r\nher excessive lust had been satisfied for the moment. Had circumstances\r\npermitted her to stay with me longer than she usually did, she would\r\nhave got more frequent fucks out of me; at night, when she could come,\r\nshe got ten and sometimes eleven discharges from me, and probably\r\nherself spent twice as often. I was indefatigable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all her after-letters to me she constantly avowed grief that she had\r\nlost her most loved son; that she was inconsolable, punning on the con\r\nin the word, which is French for \xe2\x80\x98cunt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVarious allusions of that sort were in all her loving letters. Often\r\nand often when I have been slack in fucking a woman, and my prick not\r\nanswering when called on, I had only to conjure up some of these scenes\r\nwith my mother when my cock would spring to the stand instantly, to the\r\nimmense satisfaction of my momentary _fouteuse_, and it is so yet, a\r\nthought of her reanimates it at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere my adored wife slipped her hand under his dressing-gown, and found\r\nhis prick standing fiercely, she seized it, and pretending to be his\r\nmother, cried out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, oh, come! my beloved Ferdinand, into your own loving mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell back on the couch, he got between her legs, kneeling on the\r\nfloor, having thrown off his robe, exhibiting his fine hairy arse\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthose I so dearly loved. The sight fired my salacious prick, so kneeling\r\nbehind, I guided it into his arsehole, and while he fucked my adored\r\nwife, I sodomised his superb arse. We ran two delicious courses, then my\r\nwife took me in her cunt, while the Count buggered his supposed mother,\r\nfor that stimulating idea was kept up. A second fuck followed in the\r\nsame pose, with both her apertures filled to satiety.\r\n\r\nThis concluded that delicious orgy; we had a half night\xe2\x80\x99s rest the\r\nfollowing night, as usual, to recruit, that we might better enjoy a\r\nperfect excess on the subsequent night.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way we kept up our powers, and only near the end of our\r\nvisit had we any occasion to apply the birch, and that to no great\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle of the second night that the Count continued his\r\nrecital of the result of the intrigue with his mother. His sister-child,\r\nfor she was both, was born in his first year\xe2\x80\x99s exile. Beyond his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s description of her, that she was growing up a beautiful girl,\r\nthe image of her father, meaning her son, the Count, he had no other\r\nintelligence of her. She had just turned eleven when her mother died;\r\nfor two years after that sad event she kept house for her father.\r\n\r\nHe then dying, the second brother took possession of the property. As\r\nthe state had deprived him of all civil rights, the property was given\r\nup to the brother. On his return, after being amnestied, the Count had\r\nto go to law with his brother to get back his property. His\r\nsister-daughter, who had been unhappy with her brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife, gladly\r\nleft them to keep house with the Count. She was then in her seventeenth\r\nyear, splendidly developed in bosom and bottom, lovely and lustful\r\ndeep-brown eyes, the very image of her father, although she only knew\r\nhim as her brother. The recollection of the fierce joys he had had with\r\nhis own and her mother, drove him wild with lust to possess the\r\nincestuous fruit of his intrigue with his own mother. He used of an\r\nevening after dinner to have her sit on his knee while he related his\r\nadventures abroad, intermingled with kissing and toying. He praised her\r\nsplendid bubbies and felt them; he said he could not believe that her\r\nimmense prominence behind was real unless he felt the bare skin. With\r\nlittle resistance this was permitted once, then indulged in, until from\r\nless to more he got to feeling and frigging her cunt, while he put his\r\nown standing prick into her caressing hand. There could be but one end\r\nof this. He took her maidenhead, and then she crept into his bed every\r\nnight. He initiated her into every excess of venery, and ended by\r\ngetting her with child. It was concealed as long as possible, and then,\r\non pretence of a visit to a friend at Turin, to see some fetes, he\r\nconducted her to an _accoucheuse_, and left her there until her\r\nparturition was over.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that just five weeks after that event came off we met\r\nthem at Turin, on our way home from Venice. She was a beautiful girl.\r\nThe Count introduced us as old friends, with whom everything could be\r\ndone in common.\r\n\r\nWe stopped a fortnight, and initiated her into all the mysteries and\r\nextravagancies of the wildest lust, and she proved apt a scholar that\r\nshe almost equalled in action and enjoyment the greater experience of my\r\nbeloved wife.\r\n\r\nThe Count had taken apartments at Turin for the winter, and finding his\r\nsister-daughter so facile a pupil he intended getting up a _partie\r\ncarr\xc3\xa9e_ to continue these delightful orgies. His child was a lovely\r\nfruit of double incest, and gave promise of being a lovely woman. Her\r\nmount was charmingly plump, and the pouting lips of her delicious little\r\ncunt were already lust-exciting. The Count hoped he would be able to\r\nfuck her when old enough and promised me a participation when the time\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nI may here add he had her always to bed with him, and his sister-mother\r\nevery morning, and in the bath with him.\r\n\r\nShe grew up admirably developed. From between seven and eight years old\r\nhe gamahuched her delighted cunt; at eight began rubbing his prick on\r\nher clitoris, and by nine had gradually stretched it that he could enter\r\nnearly his whole length, and spend there.\r\n\r\nWe long knew each other, and he always said he was practising the lesson\r\nmy adored wife Florence had instructed him in, when relating to us the\r\nincidents of her earlier days, and of her gradual violation by her own\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nI shall defer this story that I may at once describe the after-fate of\r\nthis beautiful child, whom I and my wife have since often enjoyed\r\nbetween us, when she was entrusted to us by her father.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to us in England he left her to perfect her English for\r\nsix months with us. We certainly perfected her erotic education while\r\nshe perfected herself in English by her own ready talent for language,\r\nfor although only in her sixteenth year, she spoke five languages\r\nperfectly, besides all the local dialects of Italy, which differ greatly\r\nfrom each other. Her stay with us was much prolonged, for at the time\r\nshe was about to leave us she proved to be with child by me. In due\r\ncourse of time she was safely delivered of a daughter.\r\n\r\nHer father, who came over to take her home after the advent, ceded the\r\ndear little object of my connection with her mother to my wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nWe had no children of our own, and she would adopt her. The Count, who\r\nin his heart was delighted at the proposition, left her with us. He\r\nafterwards had a son by this beautiful and charming daughter and\r\ngranddaughter of his at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is now long years ago, and that son legally adopted is now Count in\r\nsuccession after his father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nWe paid many visits during these years to each other, during which the\r\nCount related to us some of the episodes in his life, which I give in\r\nhis own words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask me to relate my first experiences. My earliest initiation into\r\nthe secret mysteries of love\xe2\x80\x99s recess was rather a curious one, and one\r\nwhich ended very disagreeably for the fair nun who sought to teach me\r\nthe gentle art of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know that after Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s first conquest of Northern Italy,\r\nwhen he had turned the Alps by the Savona depression, and by the battles\r\nof Montenotte and others in that neighbourhood, gained the interior\r\nplains and carried all before him, Piedmont was annexed, and after the\r\nthen French fashion, all church property was seized. Monks and nuns were\r\nturned loose in the world, with a promise of small pensions which never\r\nwere paid. A nun of a convent in our neighbourhood was one thus thrown\r\non the world. To sustain life she opened a little school for boys and\r\ngirls of tender age. The neighbouring gentry, willing to assist a worthy\r\ncreature reduced to poverty by no fault of her own, sent their children\r\nto her for primary instruction; my mother had taken a great fancy to\r\nSister Bridget, as she was called, and I was sent to her school. I had\r\njust entered into my twelfth year, but was a fine grown boy of my age,\r\nand I can remember that my prick when standing in the morning had\r\nalready shown proofs of fair development, which gave promise of its\r\nfuture prominence I think I was the biggest boy in the school, all the\r\nothers being two or three years my juniors. I was in perfect ignorance\r\nas to the relation between the different sexes. The nun seemed to have\r\ntaken a fancy to me, she used to embrace me with her arms, and kiss me\r\nwith very pouting lips, and I could feel that she seemed to suck in my\r\nbreath. She made me stand very close to her in repeating my lessons, her\r\narms or elbows, apparently by accident, were always pressed against the\r\nspot where my, at first insensible, prick lay hid. Without knowing how\r\nit came about, these sort of accidental pressures at last excited it to\r\nstand, which she, no doubt on the watch, was delighted to perceive.\r\nSeeing how she could now excite it to the point she wished to arrive at,\r\nshe said aloud one day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Fernandino, you must stay to repeat that lesson\r\nafter the school rises. You want a little extra instruction which I\r\ncannot give you while occupied with all the class.\xe2\x80\x99 I thought this a\r\nkindness on her part, but her object was very different. When all had\r\ngone and we were left alone, she desired me to come nearer, the elbow\r\nplayed its usual game, my cock stood, she pressed harder against it,\r\nthen cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Dear me! what is that hard thing in your trousers? let\r\nme see.\xe2\x80\x99 She unbuttoned them, put in her soft hand, and drew out my\r\nprick. \xe2\x80\x98How curious that is. Is it always so?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, not always.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98When\r\nhow comes it so now?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but sometimes in moving to show me\r\nmy lesson your elbow touches it, and it gets into that state.\xe2\x80\x99 All this\r\ntime she was handling my prick in the gentlest and most exciting manner,\r\nindeed she very quickly produced the spasmodic joys of heaven thus\r\nbrought down to mortal man, of course with only the nervous result. This\r\nwas all that was attempted the first time, when she told me to button\r\nup, saying that it was a very bad thing to encourage that habit, and I\r\nmust be prudent and not let others know of its being improperly hard and\r\nstiff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis sort of thing continued for a day or two. Finding I had said\r\nnothing about it to anyone, she proceeded to effect her grand object. I\r\nwas kept in as before. She excited me as usual, and soon had it out\r\nstiff-standing. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I will initiate you into love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmysteries. I see you are discreet and can be trusted; lie down on your\r\nback on this school form.\xe2\x80\x99 I did so. She lifted my shirt, my trousers\r\nwere already down on my legs, she felt the shaft and appendages, then\r\nkneeling by my side she sucked it deliciously until it felt as if it\r\nwould burst. She then rose and straddled over the low form and my body,\r\npulled her petticoats up to her navel, and to my great surprise showed\r\nan immense thick mass of hair, covering the whole of her lower belly.\r\nGuiding my prick to the entrance of her cunt, she gradually engulphed\r\nthe little object by letting her body descend upon it. I felt a certain\r\nsmarting of pain in her first movements, and my prick partially\r\nsoftened, but quickly regained all its stiffness by the pleasure she\r\ngave me by her up and down movements on it. I went off as before in a\r\nparoxysm of choking delight; she, too, spent, for I was conscious of a\r\nstream of warm liquid flowing on my cock. She tightly held me where I\r\nwas, and by cunt pressures quickly brought it up to full stiffness\r\nagain, and a second delightful paroxysm followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this I fairly shrank to nothing, and dropped out. On rising I saw\r\nthat there was a wetness streaked with blood all over my cock and cods;\r\nboylike, the sight of blood frightened me, and I began to cry, she wiped\r\nit all off, and skinned back my prick to wipe under it but here the raw\r\nsurface made it painful, and even drew a show of blood; previously my\r\nforeskin had been attached to the projecting edge of the nut, her action\r\nof sinking on it had torn it off and forced it down on the shaft,\r\ndoubtless this is the maidenhead of a boy, and hence the first smarting\r\npain and the slight loss of blood that followed. She tried to detain me\r\nthat she might get some warm water, which she told me would put it all\r\nto rights. I was too frightened, and ran off home crying all the way,\r\nand like a stupid lubberly boy, sought my mother and told her all what\r\nSister Bridget had done and showed how sore she had made my cock. My\r\nmother, enraged, ran at once to the school, where in a back room Sister\r\nBridget resided\xe2\x80\x94berated her well, and in her anger let it all out, so\r\nthat the poor woman, lost all her scholars, and was reduced to perfect\r\npoverty. However, a young Count in the neighbourhood, who had been long\r\ntrying to have her, now persuaded her to accept his protection; she had\r\nthe wisdom to make him settle indefeasibly a pension upon her, so as to\r\nbe safe from future abandonment. I, of course, soon regretted the\r\nstupidity of my conduct. As soon as cured of the slight soreness of my\r\ncock, my imagination recurred to the pleasure her handling and sucking\r\nhad given me, and the delicious paroxysms she had produced, but, alas!\r\nall too late. However, now I was awakened to the true use of a prick,\r\nand our women servants and the peasant girls in the neighbourhood, who\r\nknew of my affair with the nun, gave me encouragement, and I fucked them\r\nright and left, in the fields, under the bushes, in stables or lofts,\r\nand carried on this for a year; but at last I was discovered by my\r\nfather, and sent off to college at Savona. Colleges in Italy have\r\nschools attached for younger students like your King\xe2\x80\x99s College, in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I found a youngster but six months older than me, the son of a\r\nfriend of my family. I told him the story of my affair with the nun. We\r\nused to get leave to go to the water closet from different masters, so\r\nas not to be supposed to go together by design. From feeling our cocks\r\nand frigging ourselves until we spent, which we both now could do, my\r\nfriend suggested that I should put it into his bottom, which a young\r\nusher in his first school had taught him to do. He was a plump,\r\ngood-looking lad, with wonderfully large buttocks, and with an arsehole\r\nwhich from the usher\xe2\x80\x99s practice, whose cock was full grown, was so\r\nwidened and sunk in that it really looked more like a vulva than an\r\narsehole. By this time my cock was nearly as large as it is now,\r\nnotwithstanding it entered up to the hilt without difficulty, and I used\r\nto fuck him most deliciously. It is a curious fact that he liked to be\r\nthe recipient, and to be frigged by me at the same time. Although he got\r\ninto my arsehole a few times it was merely from curiosity; his letch was\r\nto be fucked and frigged. While at college together this quite satisfied\r\nus, and we never sought the dangerous intercourse of the strumpets of\r\nthe town, and so avoided the horrible diseases that so many of our\r\nfellow students suffered from, many for all their lives after. For years\r\nthis agreeable intercourse lasted, and was only cut short by my exile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, on my return home for the vacation, I had not forgotten\r\nSister Bridget, and longed intensely to renew my acquaintance with her.\r\nI easily discovered her abode; meeting her one day she scowled at me,\r\nand turned off in another direction. But I found out she had a favourite\r\nwalk in a lonely direction. I hid myself until she approached too near\r\nto get away, seized her hand, implored her to forgive the folly of a\r\nmere boy, who had ever regretted his ignorant stupidity, but who was now\r\na man, and longed to prove his devotion to her. Here I had unbuttoned my\r\ntrousers with the other hand, and pulled out a very fair prick, at full\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 cried I, \xe2\x80\x98see how the recollection of the paradise I lost\r\ngrieves him to the heart, let the poor dumb creature plead for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI placed the hand I held upon it, she grasped it tightly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98O! Fernandino, I always loved you, and but for your indiscretion\r\nshould have had you all myself for months.\xe2\x80\x99 I threw my arms round her\r\nneck, our mouths met in a loving kiss, her tongue darted fire into my\r\nsoul. I drew her, a willing participator, into some side bushes. She\r\nsank on the ground, her legs fell apart; I lifted her petticoats, her\r\nrich fleece and palpitating cunt were irresistible, I flung myself upon\r\nher, I gamahuched her until she spent twice, and then fucked her three\r\ntimes before I withdrew. I would willingly have continued the delicious\r\njunction, but that she implored me for prudence\xe2\x80\x99 sake to rise. We\r\nparted, but not before arranging for other meetings, which took place in\r\nwoods and barns, wherever most convenient. Her protector going for a\r\nweek to Turin during one of my vacations, I was admitted to her room at\r\nnight by climbing the roof of an outhouse, and then stark naked we\r\nindulged in every excess. She was hot and lewd to the utmost, a\r\nsplendidly made woman, with an insatiable cunt when once our sports\r\nbegan. She was, as I before mentioned, most hairy, had a well-developed\r\nclitoris, and fucked with as much pleasure in the rear attack as in her\r\ntight delicious throbbing cunt. She loved above all things to gamahuche\r\na prick, sucked it most charmingly, but with greater art licked around\r\nthe hollow below the nut, and down the under side of the prick, with an\r\noccasional lick of the ballocks, all in so exciting a manner that no\r\nmatter how often I had fucked her, she was sure to get another and\r\nanother. This charming intrigue continued until I went to Turin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring my connection with Sister Bridget I learnt the whole history of\r\nher convent life. She was forced to take the veil by her family, much\r\nagainst her will, for she even then felt the prickly sensation of\r\ndesire, making her cunt throb at the idea of coition with the male sex.\r\nShe quickly found a friend with similar desires, but more experienced,\r\nwho first taught her all the art of tribadism, and then confessed to\r\nhaving connection with the youngest father confessor. This priest came\r\nonce a week to confess the nuns, to confess their liaison, and to let\r\nhim inflict what penalty he liked. He told her he would flog her, and\r\nthen punish her where she sinned, which, in fact, meant putting his\r\nprick into her cunt when in a kneeling position. This sort of thing was\r\ndone to see if she took it in with gusto, and when it was found that was\r\nthe case, their hour of confession was a scene of every excess, stark\r\nnaked, for neither wore aught but the frock of monk or nun. This\r\ndelicious indulgence lasted until the dissolution of the convent, and\r\nyou know the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother recital of the Count much amused us. The Count was admitted at\r\nseventeen into the Royal Guard, where each private was born a gentleman,\r\nand held the rank of sub-lieutenant in the army. Here he had many\r\nintrigues, and took the maidenhead of a charming and beautifully made\r\ngirl, who was being brought up for the stage as an opera dancer, for\r\nwhich she showed early capacity. She proved a great success when brought\r\nforward. She dearly loved our friend, and was supposed to be faithful to\r\nhim, although she had developed excessive wantonness and lubricity under\r\nhis able tuition. His flight and exile separated them.\r\n\r\nYears afterwards he met a lovely, magnificent, fully developed woman,\r\nsplendidly attired, walking in the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, He did not recognise\r\nher, but was looking at her with longing eyes, when suddenly she seized\r\nhim by the arm, and exclaimed in the patois of Piedmont, _\xe2\x80\x9cCes tu si!\r\nBuzaron.\xe2\x80\x9d_ (Is that thou thyself, Buzaron). This latter word is a\r\nfamiliar expression of carnal affection, but, literally, is \xe2\x80\x9cbig\r\nbugger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir intercourse became of the warmest, she was now a first-rate\r\n_danseuse_, very highly paid.\r\n\r\nThe Count had first had her, she really loved him, and in London stuck\r\nfaithfully to him, for love alone, for she never would accept even the\r\nsmallest present. She, of course, had plenty of splendid offers from\r\nnoblemen, but as long as the Count would have her she was faithful to\r\nhim. When, which a knowing woman\xe2\x80\x99s tact senses, she saw a falling off,\r\nshe released him, and, although never refusing her person to him, took\r\nto others as well. She was a very lovely bird, and used to relate the\r\nerotic experiences of her previous years. Many of these were most\r\namusing, but one in especial showed the ardent nature of her\r\ntemperament. She had accepted, when dancing at Genoa, an eligible offer\r\nfrom the Lisbon Opera proprietors, and had to take passage on an Italian\r\nbrig; she was the only passenger, and her berth was in the same open\r\ncabin as that of the captain and mate. On the second day out the captain\r\nshowed signs of wishing to have her. She was already longing for a fuck,\r\nto which she had been daily habituated on shore, so she lent herself\r\nmost willingly to his desires; from him to the mate, and eventually to\r\nall the ship\xe2\x80\x99s company, without any jealousy of captain or mate; for the\r\nsystem in those days made captain and crew all equally interested in the\r\nsuccess of the voyage from the terms of their agreement.\r\n\r\nThe captain, mate and carpenter were owners of the vessel. The crew of a\r\nboatswain and four picked men received food, mostly dried fish, but no\r\nwages. They were entitled to a certain share of the profits of the\r\nvoyage, and thus were interested in its success, and on very different\r\nterms of intimacy with the captain to what ordinary sailors could be.\r\n\r\nThe voyage lasted six weeks, and during all that time she had every man\r\nin the ship into her every day, and from fair front-fucking had\r\neventually satisfied them in both apertures, and often had had one in\r\neach orifice, and sucked a third to spending point, which she\r\ndeliciously swallowed; she had even taken the _premisses_ of the little\r\ntwelve-year-old cabin boy, and she declared that she never enjoyed so\r\ncomplete a satisfaction of her excessive lascivious lust as in that\r\nhappy voyage of six weeks\xe2\x80\x99 duration.\r\n\r\nThe Count, who had split his sides with laughter as she recounted this\r\nextraordinary indulgence in every enjoyment of lust, related in the\r\namusing patois of Piedmont, told us that notwithstanding such excessive\r\nindulgence in both orifices, and by pricks, many of which were of\r\nimmense dimensions, not the slightest appearance of such ample\r\nstretching could be detected on the closest examination, and that in\r\neither orifice she could almost nip your prick off. One of those\r\nexceptional constitutions and splendid forms that no excess injures, and\r\nwho are ready for any number of pricks and reducing them all to\r\ninanition, while she remained as ready as ever to recommence the utmost\r\nexcess of lust as soon as anyone set had exhausted themselves.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the Count\xe2\x80\x99s confessions, I shall here give my adored\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s account of her early life in the form of a narrative, for when it\r\nwas told to me it was interrupted by various lustful encounters produced\r\nby the lascivious and exciting nature of her revelations.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of a Greek mother, married to a high clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England, a man of great erudition, who had taken the\r\nhighest honours at Oxford. When Fellow of his college he was tutor to a\r\ngreat nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s son, had travelled for years with him, and hence his\r\nwide acquaintance with the languages of modern Europe. In Greece he had\r\nfallen over head and ears in love with her mother, had tried to seduce\r\nher, and, failing that, married her. He was a man of most lustful\r\npropensities, her mother was of a beauty most attractive and exciting to\r\nsuch a man, having lustrous and most lustful eyes, extraordinary wealth\r\nof hair, which when undone reached to her heels; thick and meeting\r\neyebrows, and a well-defined moustache, all enough to drive a sensualist\r\nlike her father mad. So failing all other means to have her, he married\r\nher, and, as far as she could afterwards learn from him, was in all\r\nvoluptuously lewd, carnal acquirements, everything the wildest\r\nimagination of lust could desire. It was from her mother she inherited\r\nall that deliciously haired body, and from both parents her intensely\r\nlascivious passions. She lost her mother just as she had attained her\r\neighth year. During her mother\xe2\x80\x99s life she had generally crept into their\r\nbed in the mornings to have a cuddle, and had often been a witness to\r\nthe fucking of her mother by her father, and had, at other times, played\r\nwith his prick until it stood, and even made him spend with her toyings.\r\nShe owned to a sense of sensual gratification in this, but at that early\r\nage without any idea of the possibility of its being put into her. She\r\nalways accompanied papa to his bath, and he invariably dried her and\r\nfinished by kissing her mount and her cunt, and without tongueing it.\r\n\r\nAfter her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death he always had her to sleep the whole night with\r\nhim, and when in her ninth year he had commenced by gamahuching her\r\nclitoris, which even at that early age he declared gave promise of\r\nexceeding in projection the fine one with which her mother had been\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nIn this manner he soon awakened all the latent lubricity of her nature.\r\nAfraid to force an entrance at that early age, after exciting both her\r\nand himself, he used to rub his great prick between the lips of her\r\ncunt, and against her clitoris, until worked up to spending point, when\r\nhe transferred his prick to her mouth, and spent therein, he having\r\ntaught her to practise that voluptuous and delicious method.\r\n\r\nIt was naturally impossible to stop short _dans un tel beau chemin_, and\r\nit ended by his first getting the knob of his prick into her small tight\r\nslit and spending there, gradually forcing his way further and further\r\nin, until she, driven mad by such excitement, felt the utmost desire to\r\nhave it into the deepest recess of her longing cunt, and begged him to\r\nshove it in harder and further.\r\n\r\nWith such a spur to his passions, unable to control himself, he burst\r\nthrough all obstacles, and completely deflowered her, giving her greater\r\nagony than she expected, which was subsequently completely alleviated\r\nand converted into the most exquisite sensations. Once he had fairly\r\nfucked her, he continued to do so constantly until the age of puberty,\r\nwhich declared itself by the coming-on of her monthly courses even\r\nbefore she was twelve years of age. Already an extensive moss-bed of\r\nsable silky short curls adorned her mount and body.\r\n\r\nAt this period her father told her he must take precautions against\r\ngetting her with child; at first he drew out and spent in her mouth,\r\nwhich she dearly loved, but becoming lewd on her bottom-hole, which he\r\nconstantly fingered, he declared it was too much derangement of position\r\nto get it into her mouth, and suggested merely driving the knob into the\r\narsehole, and spending therein, which he could do by her merely heaving\r\nup her arsehole as high as her cunt had been, and so entering without\r\nany change of position on his or her part. Of course it soon came from\r\nthe knob only to the utmost length of his prick in her arse, and\r\ngradually she came so to like it that often the entire encounter of\r\nthree or four coups was delivered in her arsehole to her infinite\r\nsatisfaction; and thus her father enjoyed the first fruits of every\r\naperture in her body.\r\n\r\nHe it was that instructed her so deeply in classic literature as well as\r\nmodern languages, but always choosing such lewd works to carry out her\r\neducation, such as Meursius and Suetonius in Latin, Athenaeus with his\r\nsupper conversations in Greek, especially drawing her attention to his\r\nchapter on boy love, Boccaccio and Casti in Italian, the uncastrated\r\neditions, the adventures of Casanova, and the hundreds of other French\r\nbawdy books, with the most exciting illustrations of all these works and\r\nmany others besides. The lecture on them always led to good fucking in\r\none aperture or the other, practising the particular description that\r\nexcited their lewdness.\r\n\r\nHe thus depraved her mind that she soon longed for other experiences\r\nthan all he could give, and she cast about for an _aide-du-con_. This\r\nshe first found in their young and handsome footman, who proved not only\r\ndiscreet, but completely up to his work, and uncommonly well furnished.\r\n\r\nThey occupied in every voluptuous excess the hours papa had to attend to\r\nthe extensive and rich parish of which he was the rector. I must tell\r\nthe rest in her own words; she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContinued immunity in our excesses led to excessive in-cautiousness,\r\nand caused the discovery of our intrigue by my father, who appeared\r\nshocked and distressed at the discovery, but he was quickly reconciled,\r\nas it ended in his having the youth himself, and his introduction into\r\nour incestuous orgies, in which he both fucked and was fucked by my\r\nfather when not giving me the exquisite delight of having both together.\r\nAnd for five or six years I had but these two charming satisfiers of my\r\nlust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this period a beautiful youth of fourteen, the son of a younger\r\nbrother of my father, and, consequently, my first cousin, came to live\r\nwith us. He was an orphan, left by his mother under the guardianship of\r\nmy father. I was some three years his senior and he took to me as an\r\nelder sister, was very loving in that character only, and used to\r\nembrace and kiss me most affectionately. I, for my own part, soon began\r\nto have other feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn his first arrival, in grief at the loss of his only surviving\r\nparent, he feared to go to bed alone, so I used to accompany him, and\r\nhelp to undress him. He was all innocence, his mother, up to her recent\r\ndeath, had done the same, so he had no _mauvaise honte_, and I helped\r\noff his shirt and helped on his nightgown, and even witnessed his\r\ndiddling before he got into bed, which I tucked him in and kissed him\r\nbefore leaving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course with my then complete knowledge and practice of every art of\r\nlust, I could not but look for and discover all his secret charms, then\r\nalways in a state of repose, but promising a future development. I grew\r\nlewd upon him one morning, after an orgy with papa and the footman, who\r\nhad not altogether satisfied me. I was tempted to go along to my cousin\r\nHenry, to waken and cuddle him, knowing that he would probably awaken\r\nwith a cockstand, as usual with youths, and even men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slipt along, and at once saw, as I expected, for only partially\r\ncovered with the sheet, the prominence of his prick was unmistakable. I\r\ngently removed the sheet, and was delighted to see that his instrument,\r\ninsignificant enough when down, was of a very respectable volume when\r\nerect, and quite capable of giving any woman perfect satisfaction from\r\nits excessive hardness. I gently took it in my hand to feel it, it\r\nthrobbed at the touch, and felt like a piece of wood in hardness, with a\r\nvelvet covering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got into his bed by his side without awakening him, taking care to\r\npull up my chemise so as to let him feel the contact of my bare skin. I\r\npulled the sheet over us, took him in my arms, and woke him with a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was surprised and delighted at finding me by his side, but as yet\r\nhad no idea but that of cuddling and caressing me. In throwing my arms\r\naround him I had taken care to pull his nightgown up to his loins, so\r\nthat his naked body pressed against mine as we embraced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn apparent surprise I cried out what is that pressing so hard against\r\nmy body; at the same time moving my hand and laying hold of it. It\r\nthrobbed violently to the touch. I threw the sheet off to see what it\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98how is this? What a change! it was not like that\r\nwhen I put you to bed last night. How has it become in this strange\r\nstate?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is so, dear cousin, when I want to pee in the morning, and goes\r\ndown afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then jump up and pee, and I want to do the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took the pot and piddled. I took another and piddled, standing with\r\nlegs wide apart, and holding the chamber pot partly between and partly\r\nunder my thighs, so that he could perfectly see the whole of my cunt,\r\nand the flow of water from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stared with astonishment; it was really the first time he had any\r\nknowledge that women were differently formed down there than he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How funny,\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98you piddle from a chink, and have no doodle. I\r\nshould like to see it nearer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him I should lie down on my back on the bed, and he could look\r\nas much as he pleased, but he must never tell anybody what he would see,\r\nbecause it was a great secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe promised, of course. I lay down on my back, having first thrown off\r\nmy chemise, stretched wide my legs, told him he would see better if he\r\nknelt between my legs, some slight distance from the object to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got up and began a close examination, admiring the immense quantity\r\nof hair I had already got, opened the lips, caressed what he called the\r\nlittle doodle, my clitoris, which was rampant with lewdness. I told him\r\nto feel inside with his middle finger; he pushed it up\xe2\x80\x94I nipped it, to\r\nhis astonishment, so that he could hardly withdraw it. Nature, unknown\r\nto him, acted her part; his cock, which had gone down after piddling,\r\nstood stiffer than ever. I laid hold of it, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How comes this, Henry? You can\xe2\x80\x99t want to piddle again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, no, but I feel queer all over, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, and it seems to\r\nhave raised my doodle as you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If you will keep it secret I will show how it comes about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe promised that he would never, never, tell anything I should teach\r\nhim. So I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come to my arms, lie down on my belly, and I will teach you. There\r\nthat is it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis cock beat fiercely against my cunt. I passed my hand down, guided\r\nit into my longing cunt, then placing my hands on his buttocks pressed\r\ndown and forced his charming shaft up to the hairs of my longing cunt,\r\nfoaming with my father\xe2\x80\x99s and the footman\xe2\x80\x99s sperm, so that he slipped in\r\nwith the greatest ease; but no sooner was he hilted than one of my\r\nexquisite cunt pressures made him cry out with unexpected pleasure,\r\nwhile I spent with the delicious conviction that I was enjoying the\r\nfirst fruits of a beautiful youth. I told him how to move in and out,\r\nnature did the rest the moment he knew what to do. A very few thrusts\r\nbrought down his first tribute on the altar in the exquisite recess of\r\nVenus, the voluptuous goddess of love. I joined in the delicious\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce experiencing the joys of coition the dear boy fucked me five times\r\nbefore I could get him to withdraw, and it was only the fear of\r\ndiscovery that induced him at last to get off me. We had a delicious\r\ncuddle, and I promised to come every morning I could do so with safety.\r\nImpressing upon him the absolute necessity of secrecy and caution, if he\r\nwished to have any repetition of the delightful lesson I had given him,\r\nI returned to my room gratified beyond measure in having taken a maiden\r\ntribute. Women who have the luck of such good fortune alone know the\r\nexquisite delight of initiating a virgin prick into love\xe2\x80\x99s mysteries and\r\nour longing cunts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe carried on this delicious intercourse for months before it was\r\ndiscovered, but use begets want of caution, and my father at last\r\ndiscovered it. Poor Henry thought himself happily excused by allowing my\r\nwanton parent to take possession of his bottom while fucking me. My warm\r\nembraces enabling him to support the great and curious pain and pleasure\r\nattending a first penetration of that delicious narrow aperture,\r\ndedicated to the obscene god. It ended in his complete initiation into\r\nour orgies with the footman. His addition to the orgy enabling more\r\ncomplex and lustful combinations than two men and a woman alone could\r\nindulge in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, who lived quite up to his income, died and left me with a\r\nvery small capital at his death, which happened after the coming of age\r\nof my cousin Henry, to whom I had become violently attached. Indeed, it\r\nwas my first love, and had all the devotion and ardour of that passion.\r\nHe had a small independence, and we lived together for two years after\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s death, secretly sleeping together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe interference of relatives who, without suspecting our real sensual\r\nintercourse, preached upon what the world would say, &amp;c., induced me to\r\nundertake a governesship, for which the great instruction I had received\r\nfrom my papa more than fully qualified me. I saw the reasonableness of\r\nthis, and also thought it was more likely to strengthen Henry\xe2\x80\x99s love\r\nthan otherwise. But the parting was a great trial. He had grown a fine\r\nman, with a superb prick, although far inferior to this monster,\xe2\x80\x9d laying\r\nhold of mine at the moment standing stiff and wanting but her touch to\r\nmake me bend her back and fuck her off hand, so exciting had been her\r\nrecital.\r\n\r\nShe resumed after this episode, by saying her system of teaching was\r\neminently successful. From time to time she was comforted by interviews\r\nwith her loved Henry, besides satisfying the lust of both the father and\r\nsons of the families she lived with, teaching and taking the maidenheads\r\nof several youths, but in none receiving the gratification her loved\r\nHenry had given her, until, as she flatteringly said, she had the good\r\nfortune to enter our family and find such a jewel as I possessed.\r\n\r\nShe had occasionally found girls of such a warm temperament that she was\r\ninduced to initiate them into the art of gamahuchery. It was in this\r\ncharacter of instructress that she had first used the rod to the bottoms\r\nof her pupils, and it was seeing the erotic effect produced on them as\r\nrecipients that first gave her the letch of being herself birched. After\r\nthis she had had a vast variety of youths, fathers of families, and old\r\nworn-out patients, whom she birched into action.\r\n\r\nFrom one situation to another she had arrived at ours; since which time\r\nI knew all her doings.\r\n\r\nThe Count\xe2\x80\x99s son and my daughter meanwhile grew up to puberty. We watched\r\ntheir progress with great interest. They were both initiated in all\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s delicious mysteries by their respective parents.\r\n\r\nMy lovely little Florentia, for we christened her in my adored wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname Italianized, which became familiarly Entee, was a great comfort to\r\nus. From childhood she always came to cuddle us in bed before we rose.\r\nShe was so beautifully made that we used to strip her naked and kiss her\r\nwhole body, which always gained my dear wife an extra fuck, especially\r\nafter she reached her tenth year, when her form was rapidly developing\r\ninto puberty. Being from infancy familiar and accustomed to be always\r\nstript by us, she had no shyness; indeed she became so exciting that\r\noften I grew rampant and fucked my dear wife while she was present. She\r\ngrew to like to see us do it, and used to play with my big cock, and\r\nbring him up to the scratch. It ended as it was sure to end, in my\r\ngradually toying with her from one excitement to another, until she was\r\ncompletely fucked in her thirteenth year.\r\n\r\nTen years after that epoch I lost my beloved wife, and would have been\r\nquite inconsolable but for the sympathizing endearments of this darling\r\nchild, who became so necessary to my existence that twelve months after\r\nmy adored wife\xe2\x80\x99s decease I married her. She was a perfect Italian\r\nbeauty, and no one supposed she was other than an orphan adopted by my\r\nlate wife.\r\n\r\nNow, in my old age, she is the comfort of my life and the mother of my\r\nbeautiful son, whom we have named Charley Nixon, in memory of both my\r\nfirst adored wife and my guardian, through whom he will inherit great\r\nwealth. The dear little fellow is now eighteen years of age, handsome,\r\nwell grown, and very well furnished, although not so monstrous in that\r\nway as his father. His dear mother has initiated him in every delight,\r\nand he has all the fire of lust that his old father had before him. He\r\noften comes to us at night, indeed, it is the only thing that enables me\r\nfrom time to time to get a cockstand and a fuck at his mother. To see\r\nthem in all the agonies of lust, fucking furiously before my delighted\r\neyes, so excites me now and then, for, alas, it has come to be a\r\ngratification few and far between. But occasionally to suck up his young\r\nsperm after the excitement of their love combat produces a stiffness for\r\nmy beautiful wife to mount upon me and then have our charming son to put\r\nhis prick into her bottom for this, too, is necessary to my failing\r\nvigour, and the contact of his vigorous young prick against the thin\r\nfilmy substance separating us feels as nothing. I am long in spending,\r\nand his delighted mother gets two and sometime three delicious\r\ndischarges in her arse before my lazy prick deluges her cunt with my\r\nincestuous sperm.\r\n\r\nWe are thus a happy family, bound by the strong ties of double\r\nincestuous lust. It is necessary to have these loved objects to fall\r\nback upon, for alas! all the earlier partakers of my prick are now dead\r\nand gone. Aunt and uncle, the Dales, the Nichols, my beloved Benson, and\r\nher friends the Egertons.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the Count\xe2\x80\x99s death, and both my sisters have\r\nleft me alone, and I should have been a dreary and solitary old man but\r\nfor my beloved wife and son, who solace me and replace the void in my\r\nheart I should otherwise have so sadly felt.\r\n\r\nI shall here end this long tale of my erotic life.\r\n\r\nA curious event has happened lately, the divorce of a Mr. Cavendish from\r\nhis wife for adultery with the young Count de la Rochefoucault. The\r\ndetails brought before the court were of the most scandalous nature,\r\nespecially the letters exchanged between them when the Count had to go\r\nto Rome, where he was attach\xc3\xa9 to the French Embassy. When the husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounsel handed up the letters with the sworn notary\xe2\x80\x99s translation, he\r\nremarked that he thought they were too horribly scandalous to be read in\r\ncourt. The judge scanned a few of them, and, addressing the counsel\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly of your opinion, my learned brother, I shall take them\r\nhome and make a point of them in my address to the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that they were of such a nature that doubtless the old\r\njudge, who was no other than my dear old chum Harry Dale, gave his wife\r\ntwo or three extra fucks on the strength of the lust produced by those\r\nexciting and extraordinary lascivious letters from a young man of only\r\ntwenty-one years of age, showing quite as early an initiation into all\r\nthe luxury of the utmost depravity as any of my own details of my early\r\nexperiences with my darling old aunt.\r\n\r\nSome of the letters are a string of imaginary events as to how far they\r\ncould carry their imaginations. The Count constantly alludes to the\r\ninferiority of his descriptions to those given in her replies. Alas! as\r\nhe possesses those exciting replies of the lady, they cannot be got at,\r\nbut from his descriptions, and the remarks on certain gross\r\nfamiliarities, it\xe2\x80\x99s evident she was gifted with as lascivious and\r\nlustful a temperament as either my aunt or the divine Frankland.\r\n\r\nA chance threw these interesting letters into my possession, and I can\r\nassure the reader they are the veritable sworn translations of the\r\nletters found in Mrs. Cavendish\xe2\x80\x99s davenport when it was broken open by\r\nher husband, and produced on the trial. The Count had evidently dreaded\r\nsuch an event, and it will be seen he constantly implores her to destroy\r\nhis letters as soon as read. But, with the infatuation of her sex, she\r\nkept them to furnish the sole evidence by which she lost her place in\r\nsociety and became a lost woman. It is added that she was a woman of\r\nforty-five, and the mother of several children, but it is these randy\r\nvoluptuous matrons who have the most attractions to a young man who\r\nfeels flattered and is proud of, as he thinks, conquering a woman in a\r\ngood position in society. It is evident enough that she was no tyro in\r\nevery depravity of lust, and probably had passed through many hands\r\nbefore he gained her. He appears to have been really cunt-struck, which,\r\nas I have before observed, is one of the strongest infatuations that a\r\nman can have.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCED IN THE DIVORCE-CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVENDISH\r\n\r\n\r\n_v_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVENDISH AND ROCHEFOUCAULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nRome, _Saturday_\r\n\r\n_August 6th, 1859, 10 o\xe2\x80\x99clock_.\r\n\r\nI tried last night, my angel, to write you a half sheet, but it was as\r\nmuch as I could do to read your letter a second time, and it was only by\r\nmaking a great effort that I was able to write a few lines. However,\r\nthis morning I will try and continue, in order to reward you, not for\r\nthat one which you have deprived me of from pique, but for those\r\nbewitching ones which I have lately received.\r\n\r\nI have just received your letter 17, begun August 3rd, 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock at\r\nnight, and bless you for the idea of addressing it to Pal. B., it is\r\ninfinitely preferable, and there is no fear of any risk (\xe2\x80\x9cindiscretion\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin original) either now or later.\r\n\r\nI am delighted when I think of the pleasure you derived from what I sent\r\nyou the other day. I only decided upon it in fear and trembling. I do\r\nnot understand what you mean by letter direct to Albert. If you do not\r\nsend it per Embassy bag I should not have it here till Monday; you would\r\nhave done much better to have put it in the parcel. All last night I\r\nslept very badly, no doubt in consequence of a presentiment I had that I\r\nshould not receive a half sheet, and that you were annoyed at my going\r\nto Albano, and I thought of a mass of things as disagreeable as they are\r\npainful. Of your birthday, for instance, the 1st of October, which will\r\nbe an opportunity for II * [* II stands for her husband] to make you a\r\npresent in return for the set of studs which you gave him on his\r\nbirthday, when you, no doubt, will give him something.\r\n\r\nAs to your brown cloak which II gave you, &amp;c. &amp;c., I request that on\r\nyour birthday when he makes you his usual present, whatever it may be,\r\nyou accept it and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d and, without even looking at it,\r\nput it upon the table, immediately speak of something else, and when he\r\nhas left the room, put it away out of sight without ever speaking of it\r\nagain, or appearing to know what has become of it.\r\n\r\nI have just been interrupted for an hour and a half by M. de\r\nFiennes\xe2\x80\x94very agreeable is it not? You must forgive me if I am unable to\r\nwrite to you at length; what I have said to you above is for the future,\r\nbut the past is over since he has those studs. I forbid you to give him\r\nsomething in future, unless you cannot possibly do otherwise; and, in\r\nthat case, you must give cigarettes or anything which does not last. I\r\nwill see what is to be done about your shawl, was it not II who gave it\r\nto you? Thanks, my treasure, to walk so far from II; it is so good of\r\nyou to give up to me that walk, which I hate when you take it with him.\r\n\r\nAh! new projects again, but let us hope these will be the last, how I\r\npity you. You were so well you told me two days ago, and now you are\r\nalready obligated to take some powders\xe2\x80\x94it is II system. Nice health you\r\nseem to have; you have good reason for believing that the regimen you\r\nhave hitherto followed is a good one, it succeeds so well! Poor darling\r\nI can comprehend how uncomfortable these frequent agitations must make\r\nyou. I suffer from them so often myself.\r\n\r\nI will make you some drawings later. I have not the time today. Those\r\nuncertainties of your mother are terrible. Oh, yes, I am in despair at\r\nthat departure, particularly before my lot is decided, and knowing, as I\r\ndo, that you are unhappy. But, my child, do not fear to let it be known\r\nin every direction that you cannot endure II, and that you have taken a\r\ndisgust to him. Do not hesitate to give the true reasons when you refuse\r\nto do anything, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, or No, the hand, but with \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 it is not\r\nnecessary. I can dispense with it, nothing of that sort is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd then, when that has produced the desired effect, add, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can only\r\nlive under the same roof upon those conditions, for sooner would I go\r\naway altogether than that it should be otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d Speak in this manner;\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t answer very well at first perhaps; but he will soon get\r\naccustomed to it, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d in the morning, and \xe2\x80\x9cGood night,\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nnight. Then gradually get into the way of saying \xe2\x80\x9cMr. C.\xe2\x80\x9d when talking\r\nof, or speaking to him. You may be told it is not the custom. Answer you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care, it is not the custom to be such an idiot as he is. Ah, you\r\nare too sad, poor child, all that is charming, and all our\r\nsuperstitions. Moreover, one must think of what has been, not of what\r\nwill be, and compare it with what is. The progress is very delightful\r\nand consoling.\r\n\r\nDo not be unhappy about my horse, he did not go very well, and then I do\r\nnot care about driving in a carriage when you are on foot.\r\n\r\nI have made two drawings, one prettier than the other, and I have had a\r\ncopious emission.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. has made no tentative overtures towards me. She is often that\r\nway inclined, and with everybody. Be calm then; but, after all, you are\r\nperfectly so, only you pretend to be otherwise. God bless you for\r\nspeaking so often of your pretty rose-coloured silk stockings. I like\r\nthem so much, and adore you for wearing _them_, although it is not the\r\ncustom, above all in the day time. Doubtless it is very coquettish,\r\npretty, and wondrously exciting. Even only to think of them gives me an\r\nerection. And that rice powder! how divine you must look. It is to be\r\nhoped that the powder in your hair will not give ideas to II and\r\nembolden him\xe2\x80\x94take care. Thanks for thinking so often of me, my idolized\r\nangel. Adieu, my good, my best treasure, I love and embrace you\r\ntenderly. I will have my revenge, for I, too, had prepared a half sheet,\r\nbut will not send it till tomorrow.\r\n\r\nRome, _Saturday, for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Post_\r\n\r\n_August 6th, 1859, 2 o\xe2\x80\x99clock_.\r\n\r\nI wish to give you a little surprise, my own dear little darling, in\r\nsending you this letter, which you will receive with a half sheet upon\r\nwhich you had not reckoned on Tuesday morning, so as to supply the place\r\nof Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s post. It was to give you this little surprise, and in no way\r\nof retaliation, that I did not send a half sheet in my letter of this\r\nmorning. It was very unkind of you not to send yours upon the pretext\r\nthat I was at Albano, but you will have been ashamed of it since.\r\nBesides, even supposing that I had been there, I should not have\r\ncommitted any indiscretion with your envelopes, which are so excellent,\r\nand, if one had felt inclined to do so, your letter was sufficient to\r\nmake me indifferent to it. I suspect you of not having prepared what is\r\nnecessary, I shall be sure to see if it be so; tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s letter ought\r\nto contain two. I continue your letter 17, and I perceive with rapture\r\nthat you have had a thick cream-like emission of enjoyment. How\r\ndelicious it would be in my tea. How I should like to send you some like\r\nit also. It is a good thing that my letter to the little girl was\r\nsuccessful. Will you tell Madame de Delmar that I am sorry to hear that\r\nshe is suffering, particularly as her ordinarily detestable disposition\r\nonly becomes more thick and more execrable. Suppress this latter part if\r\nyou think it better.\r\n\r\nAh! you think that Madame Salvi has played her cards well and in what\r\nway, I ask? You are too bad, too implacable. I do not like that in you.\r\nI have told you that your suspicions wounded me, and I think you can\r\nbelieve me when I tell you that I have completely changed my conduct in\r\nthat respect. Besides, what can I possibly do. I am very uncomfortable\r\nhere. The Abdol don\xe2\x80\x99t want me; besides, the Duke has given me to\r\nunderstand that I ought occasionally to go and see his wife, and the\r\nBorgh bother me with all their children.\r\n\r\nThanks, my good angel, for the letter Des Pierre. If it be decided that\r\nyou leave, I shall go for a few days to Civita\xe2\x80\x94sad and mournful\r\nconsolation. Why do you tell me that you will go barefooted when I go to\r\nsee you. I am quite of your opinion that your feet are only too\r\ndelicious. The costume rather disgusted me than otherwise, without,\r\nhowever, producing any effect upon me. Tomorrow I shall pay the Duchess\r\nde Grano a visit, and since it seems to put you out, shall not return\r\nagain to Albano.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows that the pleasure is not great, and that I care very little\r\nfor it. The other day I did not even find it any cooler there. The\r\nDuchess of St. Alban\xe2\x80\x99s leaves on the 20th for Schwalback and England on\r\naccount of the apprehensions about war\xe2\x80\x94another subject of uneasiness for\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94such is life. I can go and live with the Duchess de Grano and Salvi.\r\nNo one would say anything about the one, and not much about the other,\r\nwhatever you yourself might say, but that annoys me exceedingly, and\r\ndisgusts me, and I dare not do so with you. You might, however, have\r\nbeen my ambassadress, see what it is to be so seductive, so graceful, so\r\npretty, so kind and gentle. Just fancy, dearest, that I have not\r\nanswered Madame Rudiger. I must really do so today. She is a person one\r\nmust be careful with.\r\n\r\nI have always this phrase before my eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI prepared a divine half\r\nsheet yesterday evening, but dare not send it!\xe2\x80\x9d Very agreeable, and very\r\nkind of you! well, I do not complain.\r\n\r\nThey have been so heavenly during the last three days, and mine are so\r\nshameful. How nice it is for me to think that I should have sufficient\r\ninfluence over you to get you to sit perfectly naked at my table. Long\r\nago might you have had that influence over me, and even have enforced\r\nrequirements more depraved, and more degrading than that if you had\r\nwished it, and with what rapture! Adieu, my angel, what a happiness to\r\ngive you this trifling pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen I shall have undressed my adorable little mistress it will be nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, she will be mad with desire, delirious from passion and\r\nrapturous exactions (exigencies), her maddening look exciting me in the\r\nhighest degree will arouse all the strength I possess, and enable me to\r\nexhaust her so completely that she herself will attain the height of\r\nhappiness; the greater the refinement and delicacy of my caresses the\r\ngreater will be your happiness, the more languishing will your eyes\r\nbecome, the more will your pretty mouth unclose itself, the more will\r\nyour tongue become agitated, the more will your bosoms, firm and soft as\r\nvelvet, become distended, and their nipples grow large, red, and\r\nappetizing; then will your arms grow weaker and then will your angelic\r\nlegs open themselves in a voluptuous manner, and then seeing ourselves\r\nreflected on all sides in the mirrors, shall I take you in my arms in\r\norder to excite you (_branler_, frig) with my hand, whilst your little\r\nrosy fingers will similarly excite me with vigour, and I shall suck your\r\ndivine nipples with passion. When the agitation of your little legs, of\r\nyour lovely little bottom (_derri\xc3\xa8re_), of your head, and those murmurs\r\nof pleasure (_rugissements_) prove to me that you are at the point of\r\nemission, I shall stop and carry you to a piece of furniture made to\r\nsustain your head, your back, your bottom, and your legs, and having\r\nnear your cunt (_con_) an opening sufficiently wide to allow my body to\r\npass erect between your legs; then shall I fuck (_enfiler_) you with\r\nfrenzy with my enormous and long member, which will penetrate to the\r\nmouth of your womb; being squeezed by your pretty legs, which will bring\r\nme closer to you, I shall wriggle (_remuerai_) my strong pretty member,\r\nwhich you love, with more vigour than ever; my private parts (_organes\r\nm\xc3\xa2les_, testicles) will touch your little bottom, and this contact will\r\nprovoke such an abundant flow of the essence of love in your little cunt\r\nthat I shall be as if I were in a bath.\r\n\r\nHow I fear to leave off there! But we shall see. Do not write to me by\r\nthe night post, it is useless! It is true that when I am near you in a\r\ncarriage I have difficulty in remaining quiet. Oh, no, do not alarm me\r\nby your insatiability, mine is much greater than yours, there is not the\r\nslightest comparison to be drawn between us in a physical point of view,\r\nbut as far as our moral nature and heart is concerned we can rival each\r\nother, and I am very happy on that account.\r\n\r\n1:40. I was most annoyingly interrupted by the luncheon bell, and\r\nafterwards I played a game of Fourreau (a game all the fashion at\r\nVerteuil), and here I am again. I have just refused to accompany my\r\nfather and mother in a drive in the neighbourhood, so that I shall be\r\nable to write to you more at length, unless, indeed, I write to\r\nFallenay.\r\n\r\nYou tell me that you like the little costume, but that is all you say,\r\nand you give me no details as to the colours, the length and shape. I\r\nwill believe my treasure, my jewel, that your bosoms will be white,\r\nswollen and soft as velvet, and it is very nice of you to tell me that\r\nmy hands will have difficulty in holding them and putting their ruby\r\nlips to my mouth.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right in saying that you will develop my virility, it is\r\nyou who have made my member what it is now. I repeat, on my word of\r\nhonour, perhaps you will not like to hear these details, but,\r\nnevertheless, I shall say it, you are the first woman in the world who\r\nhas stimulated that essence which flows from my prick (_queue_), which\r\nyour kisses have rendered so pretty, and it is you who have plucked the\r\nflower of my virginity. Never have I had (_bais\xc3\xa9_) any other woman, and\r\nwhatever may be the misfortunes to which I may be destined, it will\r\nalways be an immense and ineffable happiness to me to think that I have\r\ngiven and lost it through the luscious draughts you offer (_par tes\r\nd\xc3\xa9lices_). It is, and it will be, perhaps, the greatest blessing, and\r\nthe only consolation of my life. But before God it is a great one, and\r\nmy enjoyment has not been such as one can expect to find in this world.\r\nI do not believe that he who had the madness to rob you of yours was as\r\npure as myself, and as for voluptuous pleasures, if there be any greater\r\nthan that which I know, I promise you never to learn or seek it,\r\nalthough I don\xe2\x80\x99t require this at your hands. I do not wish to have any\r\nother woman spoken of, they all disgust me, even to look at them. You\r\nknow it, and you know that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in you\r\nto disgust me, but all that belongs to you maddens me, and I love and\r\nadore all; it has become a madness, and you know it; for when you are\r\nkind you give at least the idea by letter of that which you would not do\r\nif you had the slightest doubt.\r\n\r\nYou know that I have sucked you between the legs at those delicious\r\nmoments when you made water, or when you had your monthly courses, and\r\nthat my happiness will be complete when you will allow me, and when\r\ncircumstances will allow you, to let me lick (_passer la langue_) at\r\nthat ineffable moment when your little love of a jewel of a bottom has\r\njust relieved itself. In you everything appears different and pure, the\r\npurity which reigns in your every feature, the excess of refinement\r\nwhich exists in your whole body, your hands, your feet, your legs, your\r\ncunt, your bottom, the hairs of your private parts, all is appetizing,\r\nand I know that the same purity exists in all my own desires for you. As\r\nmuch as the odour of women is repugnant to me in general, the more do I\r\nlike it in you. I beg of you to preserve that intoxicating perfume \xe2\x80\xa6 but\r\nyou are too clean, you wash yourself too much. I have often told you so\r\nin vain. When you will be quite my own, I shall forbid you to do so too\r\noften, at most once a day. My tongue and my saliva shall do the rest.\r\n\r\nIf it is necessary let the doctor cauterize you (_toucher_), that is to\r\nsay with his instrument, and mind he does not fall in love with you; I\r\nbet he has never before seen anything so seducing, so pretty, or so\r\nperfect. It is to be hoped that the irritation does not proceed from the\r\nsize of my member.\r\n\r\nYou did quite right to go to the play, and I regret sincerely to have\r\nspoilt the pleasure you had in going, it shall not happen again.\r\n\r\nAs to the place George had, that is perfectly indifferent to me.\r\n\r\nAh! you think that the portrait was done afterwards. You are not sure of\r\nit, but it is a matter of no moment, my much loved one. I shall not be\r\nthe less happy to have the photograph if you are good enough to give it\r\nto me, not too much in miniature. I shall be very grateful for it.\r\n\r\nIf I said that Galitzin was clever, I was wrong; he has a kind heart,\r\nand is very fond of me. Now that he has lost his mother, I shall be more\r\nkind to him. He is a person one can depend upon; his letters are silly\r\nproductions. Those Russians have always the imagination easily excited.\r\n\r\nYes, my father has always the same answer. Thanks for your obliging\r\noffer of gloves, my mother must settle about it.\r\n\r\nI shall still have lavished the following caresses upon you, angel of my\r\ndelight, were I a little calmer. I had a dream, such as it was, about it\r\nlast night, and only remember it just now by way of explanation of my\r\nmad excitement of this morning. I saw you as I was asleep, you were by\r\nmy side frigging me with your fingers of love, and you heard me say to\r\nyou, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you there.\xe2\x80\x9d You are as lovely as Venus, your lusciousness\r\nand lasciviousness are at their very height, your body is completely\r\nperfumed with your urine, in which I forced you to bathe yourself for my\r\nenjoyment, so that I might lick you. You have painted the most seductive\r\nparts of your person. Your shoulders are white, your rosy bosoms reveal\r\nthemselves through a rose-coloured gauze, trimmed with bows of the same\r\nhue. Your thighs, as well as your navel and your heavenly bottom, are\r\nrevealed through a heavenly gauze, your legs are clad in rose-coloured\r\nstockings. The sperm flows; but how much I needed it! This is true, for\r\nmy testicles were swollen in an alarming manner.\r\n\r\nOh, my child, my pretty little mistress, if you only knew how much I\r\nsuffer from the excessive heat, and the privation in which I live!\r\nWithout exaggeration, my testicles are enormous. My member is as large,\r\nstraight, and stiff as my arm. I am mad from desire for you. I had the\r\nunhappy idea of going to bed again. My mind was full of a dream I had\r\nhad, and of which you were, of course, the subject. Then I thought of\r\nthe caresses which you would have been obliged to submit to, and at\r\nlast, in consequence of your yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s half sheet, so pretty at the\r\nbeginning and at the end, but yet quite beside the question, and found\r\nmyself engaged in the act of rubbing myself with frenzy, and of stroking\r\nmyself and of frigging my prick (_la pine_) until I was exhausted,\r\nbefore I could discharge the merest drop; that was too much for me, and\r\nnow I desire you like a mad man. If a delicious half sheet does not\r\narrive by the Embassy bag, I know not what will become of me. I have had\r\nan emission. I am saved. I shall feel myself so relieved. You have\r\nforbidden my going with other women. You are determined that I shall not\r\nhave a discharge with anyone but yourself, and that I have fucked\r\n(_bais\xc3\xa9_) no one but you. Oh! how I must love you.\r\n\r\nIt is two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, I have violated and well worked you,\r\nkissed, frigged, licked, and sucked you, obliged you to yield to my\r\ndesires, the most debauched, the most shamelessly degrading during the\r\nwhole of the afternoon. All the afternoon, too, I have got you to suck\r\nmy member and my testicles. I have made you pass your tongue between my\r\ntoes and under my arms. I have compelled you to paint your body, to\r\ndrink my urine. I was almost on the point of getting you sucked and\r\nlicked by a pretty Lorette, perfectly naked, between your legs, and to\r\nmake you piss into her cunt in order to make the depravation more\r\ndebased than ever. I have had discharges from jealously. I have\r\ndischarged at least forty times; and when, after having left you to go\r\nto my club, I returned home, and finding you fast asleep from\r\nexhaustion, I awakened you and insisted upon your frigging me with your\r\nrosy fingers, all the while licking my several parts. You implore me.\r\nYou are wearied, but I am intractable. You must do it in order to excite\r\nyou as much as I am myself excited. I suck your breast with frenzy. The\r\nsucking that I have given your bosoms, and the fear you have lest I\r\nshould fetch a young girl to violate you with her breasts in your cunt,\r\nfilling your womb with her milk, excite your senses, and then you hear a\r\nvoice whose sound alone so pleasingly tickles your womb, saying to you,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy pretty mistress, I implore you to abandon your (?) to me. I will\r\nlove you so fondly. I will be too kind and gentle, I am so handsome, I\r\nwill do all you can possibly wish. I know so well how to have and suck a\r\nwoman, my member is enormous, it is beautiful, rose-coloured, large,\r\nlong, hard and vigorous. Yield yourself to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTell me if you like this one.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready you will call me so that I may come and say my daily\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d You will begin by taking my \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 out of my trousers, then\r\nhalf opening your gown, you will lift up your pretty chemise with one\r\nhand, and will pass your other arm, soft as satin, round my neck. I\r\nshall embrace you tenderly, then I shall lick your snow-white shoulders,\r\nyour bosoms, which seem to be bursting from the imprisonment of your\r\nrose-coloured stays embroidered with lace. I shall lick between your\r\nlegs, over your divine little bottom, your nymph-like thighs being at\r\nthat moment on my knees; then you will place your angelic little feet,\r\nwith your stockings on, one after the other in my mouth. After this you\r\nwill send me into the dining room, in order to get rid of the servants,\r\nand, by this time, filled with an amorous and impassioned languor, each\r\nof your movements breathing forth the frenzy and voluptuousness of\r\npassion, you will come and join me. There will be only one chair, and\r\nthe table will be laid for only one person. We shall each of us have\r\nonly one hand free, I the right, and you the left; then you will sit\r\nupon my left leg, which you have found the means to make naked; you will\r\nhave unfastened your gown in such a way that it will hang down behind,\r\nand your right hand will caress and stroke my enormous prick, which you\r\nwill have taken between your legs without putting it into your angelic\r\ncunt, whilst my left arm will wind itself round your lovely waist in\r\norder to bring you still nearer to me.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, which will have lasted till half-past twelve, and which\r\nwill have given you strength, we will go into the little rose-coloured\r\nboudoir. I shall place myself in a low narrow chair, and as I shall be\r\nvery much excited by your enchanting looks, my enormous member will come\r\nout of its own accord from its prison, and you will sit astraddle upon\r\nme, introducing, with the greatest difficulty, my pretty and vigorous\r\nprick into your pretty girl-like cunt, when wriggling about from sheer\r\nenjoyment you will stop its movements every time I tell you I am on the\r\npoint of discharging, so as to increase my desires and my transports of\r\nhappiness. Then in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time you will get up and place\r\nyourself upon the sofa, whilst I, at your desire, shall rip off all my\r\nclothes; then you will get up from the sofa and take off your\r\ndressing-gown only keeping on what you have underneath. In my turn I\r\nwill stretch myself on the sofa, getting every moment more delirious\r\nwith passion, for your dress, betraying the delicious outlines of your\r\nfigure, without revealing them entirely, will render me almost beside\r\nmyself, and will make my prick so long and so stiff that you will hardly\r\nbe able to sit on its point without being fucked, in spite of its size,\r\nwhich will force from you sighs and murmurs of rapture. At last, when\r\nonce seated, fucked by my manly and powerful prick, you will throw\r\nyourself backwards. I should lean my enraptured legs against your\r\nbosoms, in order that you might lick my feet, while you would pass your\r\namorous and divine legs, softer, whiter, and more rose-tinted every day,\r\nover the whole breadth of my chest, placing your tiny goddess-like feet\r\nin my mouth. As our desires would augment at every moment, you would\r\nallow me, would even ask me to take off your garters, your pretty\r\nstockings, and your slippers, in order to procure me the luxury of\r\nlicking every part of your body there, and of realising in the most\r\nperfect manner the intense enjoyment arising from the contact of the\r\nmost delicate, the most woman-like, the most voluptuous member of your\r\nbody. My hands would frig your little love of a member, my manly prick\r\nwould kiss your celestial womb, and my thighs would caress your\r\ndelicious bottom. When I have worked you in this way for hours, ceasing\r\nevery moment you were on the point of emission, I should, as I withdrew\r\nmy member, let you at last discharge, and then an immense stream of love\r\nwould flow into my mouth, which suddenly and as if by enchantment would\r\nfind itself in the place of my member while your bosoms would be covered\r\nwith that white essence of which you are the only source in my eyes (I\r\nhad never known it before Homburg), and which would escape from my\r\namorous member.\r\n\r\nEvery day after dinner, reclining voluptuously on a couch, you would\r\nsnatch a few moments of repose while I was taking off all my clothes.\r\nWhen I had finished, and when I, filled with love, had shown myself to\r\nyour contemplation, you would give up to me your place upon the sofa,\r\nand assuming the most seductive, the most coquettish, and the most\r\ngraceful attitudes, would come and play with my member, whose vigour\r\nwould arise solely from the sight of your pretty costume, which, I am\r\nconvinced, would render you more delicious than the most graceful fairy.\r\nYou would love me so deeply that I should cease to have any power of\r\nwill, you would have exhausted me, sucking me completely dry, nothing\r\nwould remain in my prick, which would be more full of desire, more\r\nenormous, and stiffer at every moment. My languishing eyes, gentle as\r\nlove itself, surrounded by large dark blue circles caused by your look,\r\nyour tongue, your bosom, your cunt, your member, your heavenly little\r\nbottom, your legs, your fingers, and your angelic little feet would tell\r\nyou how complete was my happiness, my intoxication, my ecstasy, and my\r\nfaint, exhausted but happy voice would give you the same assurance,\r\nwould murmur with rapture in your ears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh how I love you, my lady love,\r\nmy divine little virgin, caress me yet once more, again, still again, it\r\nis a dream. Thank you, oh, thank you and yet again. Oh I am in heaven,\r\ndo not pause, I implore you, suck me harder than ever; lick me well; oh!\r\nwhat rapture; ask me what you will, it shall be yours. You are my\r\nmistress, no other but you in the whole world can transport me in this\r\nway. Frig me with your knees. Oh! oh! oh! I am going to discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nmy half-opened mouth would prove to you my enjoyment, and the thirst I\r\nhad for the bliss you could confer.\r\n\r\nThen, more full of passion than ever woman lover had ever been, and\r\nenraptured as you listened to my voice, so completely beneath your sway,\r\nlistening only to your own love, you would raise your little coquettish\r\npetticoat, and pressing dear little loves of calves more closely\r\ntogether, for you could be on your knees, resting upon my little blue\r\nveins, you would frig me in this manner, with greater vigour than ever\r\nsitting down every now and then upon your fine little heels, in order\r\nthe better to release my beautiful prick, perfectly straight and rudely\r\nswollen and inflamed with passionate desires, from between your divine\r\nthighs, as soft as satin, and as white as snow, to better introduce the\r\nwet tips of your lovely and velvet like bosoms into the seductive little\r\nhole of my member, whilst my knees raised slightly behind would gently\r\ncaress your bottom, so as to give you some little satisfaction in your\r\nturn; and at last, unable any longer to retard the moment of emission,\r\nyou would bend forward, resting upon both your hands, to increase my\r\ndesire, and keeping yourself back a little distance from me, while your\r\npetticoats would now cover my head, and act almost like an electrical\r\nconductor upon me, you would intoxicate me with the perfume exhaled from\r\nyour legs, from your member, from your cunt, from your bottom, and\r\nlastly, you would slake my thirst and complete the celestial transport\r\nby pissing, with eager rapture, between my burning lips some of that\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s nectar which you would alone possess, and which, emanating from\r\nyou alone in the world, is worthy of the gods. It would be half-past\r\neight.\r\n\r\nYou cannot form any idea of my excitement at this moment. I hope you\r\nwill like this, and will answer me prettily. Am I sufficiently in love?\r\nAnd do you believe there will be another woman in the whole world beside\r\nyourself for whom I shall have any desire? Oh, how wild is the longing\r\nthat I have for you at this moment; and this nectar I have spoken of,\r\nfrom whom else could I care for it, could I endure it even, whilst from\r\nyou what mad delight! Tell me, do you believe this? You know it\r\nperfectly well, I am sure; these are not mere words. Tell me that you\r\nwill piss into my mouth again when I ask you. I am now going to try to\r\nsleep, but what chance of doing so with this love that consumes me. I\r\nmust await your pretty letter of tomorrow morning, for it is that alone\r\nwhich will excite the flow and stream.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight you would like to conform to the usages of this room\r\nof mirrors, and as your desires have become greatly inflamed by my own\r\nstate, and by the soft and sensual temperament of our bodies, you would\r\nask me to undress you, in order that, being completely naked, I might\r\nthe more easily overwhelm you with my most passionate caresses. I should\r\nthen strip you of everything, except that in order that your feet might\r\nnot come into immediate contact with the looking glasses upon which we\r\nshould be walking, I would slip on your feet a pair of tiny little\r\nslippers, with little silk soles, at a distance they would hardly be\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nSomeone is coming. Adieu till tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd larger and stouter than that of my little darling, and so\r\nindifferently shod with shoes. (Their boots are pretty.)\r\n\r\nAdieu, my angel, I finish this so as to be enabled to add a few lines to\r\nthe picture\xe2\x80\x94it is late. I love you with all my soul, with love, respect,\r\nand adoration. Nothing yet has been heard about de L. R. It is very bad\r\nweather, and my father is still no better.\r\n\r\nI would take you for a drive either in a pretty barouche or in a\r\nphaeton, your toilette would be beautiful but simple. I would only\r\ninsist upon your wearing a veil, for my love and happiness would render\r\nme somewhat egoistical with regard to others. We should not be serious\r\nall the time of our drive, for at every instant I should steal a kiss,\r\nand your feet would be resting on mine.\r\n\r\nWe should return home about half-past five to dress for dinner. You\r\nwould change everything, and without paying any attention to what our\r\nservants might think, I should put on a loose pair of trousers, prettier\r\nthan what I had worn this morning but, like them, opening in the front.\r\nAs for you, my own love, I should insist upon your dressing yourself as\r\na ravishingly pretty little _danseuse_, with some little difference,\r\nhowever, in my favour. Your hair would be in curls, falling all round\r\nyour head, upon your beautiful naked shoulders. You would crown them\r\nwith a pretty garland of flowers, such as I like for Aim\xc3\xa9e. You should\r\nwear a light-coloured muslin dress, very low and very short, up to the\r\nknees, your arms bare, and the skirts exceedingly full (the body of\r\nwhich would be transparent, and refine and reveal the divine shape of\r\nyour angelic bosoms), your legs, perfectly naked, would be visible\r\namongst a mass of folds of muslin, and would be covered by little\r\nopen-work stockings of rose-coloured silk, fastened at the instep by\r\nbows, like the dress, and on your tiny virgin feet you would have little\r\nsatin shoes, without soles. To pass into the dining room, so as to avoid\r\ncatching cold, and also prevent the servants revelling in the sight of\r\nmy treasure, you would envelope yourself from head to foot in a long\r\nveil. During dinner I would try to remain tolerably quiet so that you\r\nmight eat and strengthen yourself for the evening, which would be a\r\nfatiguing one. Our servants would have directions not to enter until we\r\nrang; during each course you would open your veil, and turning towards\r\nme (for you would be on my right hand), you would place your pretty legs\r\nacross mine; immediately my manly prick, which your love would render\r\ndaily more and more delicious, would display its vivacity, and you would\r\ncaress it with your lovely satin-like calves, your chair enabling you to\r\ndo this, being tolerably large, with only one arm on the right, while\r\nmine would be much lower, that would not fatigue you much, and this is\r\nwhat you would say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I not bewitching and delicious? Do you not\r\nthink me voluptuous? and regard me as your mistress, holding you under\r\nmy entire subjection? I am very happy to please you this way.\xe2\x80\x9d And I\r\nshould answer, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am your slave; you give me the greatest enjoyment\r\nthat can be had; there is not a woman in the world who possesses the\r\nattractions you have; you make me do anything, you are the queen of\r\nvoluptuousness, of enjoyment. No one knows how to make love as you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAt last at the dessert you would glide gently upon my lap, allowing your\r\npetticoats to flow behind. I should suck your bosoms, for as the\r\nservants would be getting their own dinners, I should have thrown your\r\nveil quite off, and you would then appear enveloped in all your many\r\ncharms. Then I should give you your dessert, which would consist of a\r\nbiscuit moistened with that white essence which you alone in the whole\r\nworld have known and know how to produce in me, and for my reward you\r\nwould allow me to make my wine for dessert. I would then place my\r\nwine-glass between your legs, opened voluptuously wide, and you would\r\nlet that delicious urine flow into it. The intoxication that this\r\nfragrant liquor would produce would be the signal for my most passionate\r\ncaresses.\r\n\r\nYou would begin by placing yourself astride me, and I should thrust with\r\nthe greatest difficulty my virile member between your legs. In this\r\nposition we should leave the dining room, I carrying you along by the\r\nstiffness of my member, while every step I took would make you wild with\r\nexcess of enjoyment. We should go into a pretty boudoir, the floor of\r\nwhich would be completely covered with looking glasses, and filled with\r\nfurniture intended by their shape and softness to augment the\r\nvoluptuousness of our embraces. No costume whatever would be put on in\r\nthis room. Nudity alone would have a right to remain there. There would\r\nbe pieces of furniture to excite the senses and whereon to recline,\r\nothers enabling us to suck each of our members, to lick, to frig, to\r\nkiss, to enjoy, to complete our performance, to discharge, to fuck, in\r\none word, to supplement and promote the extremest refinements of the\r\nmost celestial and most perfect of all enjoyments.\r\n\r\nThe continuation on some future occasion my fear of exciting you will\r\ndepend somewhat upon my letter of this evening or tomorrow, and\r\nparticularly upon the frank and sincere reply for which I ask you for\r\nthe day after tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSend me back the beginning.\r\n\r\nYou cannot have the faintest idea of my dread when one of these sheets\r\nis on its way.\r\n\r\nWhy do you trouble yourself to pay so much attention to style and\r\nwriting\xe2\x80\x94that takes time. I never read mine over, and that is so much\r\ntime gained.\r\n\r\nENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE LETTER WRITTEN BY THE COUNT ALMOST ENTIRELY\r\nIN CYPHER\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the response of my heart, my beloved adored one.\r\n\r\nThou shall have it as soon as I shall dare to send it to you.\r\n\r\nThou shalt belong to me entirely one day, perhaps in eighteen months,\r\nand then here is the existence which you shalt have the grief to be\r\ncompelled to lead.\r\n\r\nIn the apartment which I depicted to you the other day, and with the\r\ntoilette that I require of my beloved lady, my lady mistress is to\r\nrender herself every day between eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock and noon.\r\n\r\nShe will find there thy loving husband, all fresh and in every respect\r\ndesirable (_gentil_), clothed in a dressing-gown of very light texture.\r\n\r\nFrom noon until three o\xe2\x80\x99clock this is the programme.\r\n\r\nAt noon thou wilt stretch thyself on thy easy chair, thou wilt loosen a\r\nlittle thy girdle and open thy pretty dressing-gown. I on my bent knees\r\nat your side shall lick you with my tongue, while my arm shall encircle\r\nthy divine waist and thy two naked arms shall encircle my neck;\r\nafterwards softly widening thy virgin legs thou will cast aside all that\r\nwhich hides from the eyes, and you will place me between those divine\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nSuccessively I shall lick with voluptuousness thy neck, thy shoulders,\r\nunder thy arms, thy breasts. I shall suck with force those chaste little\r\nbosoms, which by their swelling would desire to escape from the pretty\r\nlittle rose-coloured stays; then passing to thy intoxicating cunt, I\r\nshould suck it with such an amount of frenzy that thou wouldst discharge\r\nfor the first time in my mouth.\r\n\r\nThis done it will have so much excited me that, taking thy place, it\r\nwill become your turn to mount between my legs, and licking all my chest\r\nthou wilt finish by frigging with passion my prick, which will become\r\nlonger and straighter than ever.\r\n\r\nAs soon as thou shalt feel the enjoyment coming thou wilt cease, in\r\norder to lick the parts adjoining.\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock thou wilt want to make water, then my mouth adhering\r\nbetween thy legs, thou wilt allow me to swallow all, then lying down\r\nagain on thy little belly, I shall lick with fury thy bottom so\r\nvoluptuous, and thy delicious legs.\r\n\r\nAfterwards it will be thy turn to continue thy caresses upon me.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock both of us elevated in a supreme degree, lifting up thy\r\nlittle chemise in front we shall do the business, that is to say, that\r\nsurrounding me with vigour with thy legs, thou wilt make efforts in\r\norder to fuck thyself (_enfiler_), but my member will be to such a\r\ndegree enormous that we shall have all the trouble in the world (the\r\ndelights corresponding to the efforts). At last, once entered thou wilt\r\nprocure, by my movements and my pauses, such enjoyments that I shall\r\nhear you uttering the softest murmurs of thy voice, and so that thou\r\nwilt wriggle thyself on my ravished prick which will still further\r\naugment thy transports.\r\n\r\nThou wilt enjoy thyself thus three times. At the third time I shall suck\r\nthy breasts with such passion that thy eyes depicting a heavenly languor\r\nand a divine abandonment, thou wilt empty out upon me thy\r\ndelirium-causing seminal fluid.\r\n\r\nThat will last until half-past two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, then we shall sleep together\r\nthus until three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock thou wilt go to dress\r\nthyself in order to go out or to receive visits.\r\n\r\nBehold, the following part shall come to you if the commencement pleases\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMem. The commission herein is returnable in Paris, 24th June, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
