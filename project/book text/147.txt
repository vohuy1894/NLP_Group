But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nAs a long and violent abuse of power, is generally the Means of\r\ncalling the right of it in question (and in Matters too which might\r\nnever have been thought of, had not the Sufferers been aggravated\r\ninto the inquiry) and as the King of England hath undertaken in his\r\nown Right, to support the Parliament in what he calls Theirs, and as\r\nthe good people of this country are grievously oppressed by the\r\ncombination, they have an undoubted privilege to inquire into the\r\npretensions of both, and equally to reject the usurpation of either.\r\n\r\nIn the following sheets, the author hath studiously avoided every\r\nthing which is personal among ourselves. Compliments as well as\r\ncensure to individuals make no part thereof. The wise, and the\r\nworthy, need not the triumph of a pamphlet; and those whose\r\nsentiments are injudicious, or unfriendly, will cease of themselves\r\nunless too much pains are bestowed upon their conversion.\r\n\r\nThe cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind.\r\nMany circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but\r\nuniversal, and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind\r\nare affected, and in the Event of which, their Affections are\r\ninterested. The laying a Country desolate with Fire and Sword,\r\ndeclaring War against the natural rights of all Mankind, and\r\nextirpating the Defenders thereof from the Face of the Earth, is the\r\nConcern of every Man to whom Nature hath given the Power of feeling;\r\nof which Class, regardless of Party Censure, is the\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\r\n\r\nP.S. The Publication of this new Edition hath been delayed, with a\r\nView of taking notice (had it been necessary) of any Attempt to\r\nrefute the Doctrine of Independance: As no Answer hath yet appeared,\r\nit is now presumed that none will, the Time needful for getting such\r\na Performance ready for the Public being considerably past.\r\n\r\nWho the Author of this Production is, is wholly unnecessary to the\r\nPublic, as the Object for Attention is the Doctrine itself, not the\r\nMan. Yet it may not be unnecessary to say, That he is unconnected\r\nwith any Party, and under no sort of Influence public or private,\r\nbut the influence of reason and principle.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 14, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE ORIGIN AND DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL,\r\nWITH CONCISE REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nSome writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave\r\nlittle or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only\r\ndifferent, but have different origins. Society is produced by our\r\nwants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our\r\nhappiness positively by uniting our affections, the latter\r\nnegatively by restraining our vices. The one encourages intercourse,\r\nthe other creates distinctions. The first a patron, the last a\r\npunisher.\r\n\r\nSociety in every state is a blessing, but government even in its\r\nbest state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an\r\nintolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same\r\nmiseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without\r\ngovernment, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish\r\nthe means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge\r\nof lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of\r\nthe bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear,\r\nuniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver;\r\nbut that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a\r\npart of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest;\r\nand this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every\r\nother case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.\r\nWherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it\r\nunanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely\r\nto ensure it to us, with the least expence and greatest benefit, is\r\npreferable to all others.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain a clear and just idea of the design and end of\r\ngovernment, let us suppose a small number of persons settled in some\r\nsequestered part of the earth, unconnected with the rest, they will\r\nthen represent the first peopling of any country, or of the world.\r\nIn this state of natural liberty, society will be their first\r\nthought. A thousand motives will excite them thereto, the strength\r\nof one man is so unequal to his wants, and his mind so unfitted for\r\nperpetual solitude, that he is soon obliged to seek assistance and\r\nrelief of another, who in his turn requires the same. Four or five\r\nunited would be able to raise a tolerable dwelling in the midst of a\r\nwilderness, but one man might labour out of the common period of\r\nlife without accomplishing any thing; when he had felled his timber\r\nhe could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in\r\nthe mean time would urge him from his work, and every different want\r\ncall him a different way. Disease, nay even misfortune would be\r\ndeath, for though neither might be mortal, yet either would disable\r\nhim from living, and reduce him to a state in which he might rather\r\nbe said to perish than to die.\r\n\r\nThus necessity, like a gravitating power, would soon form our newly\r\narrived emigrants into society, the reciprocal blessings of which,\r\nwould supersede, and render the obligations of law and government\r\nunnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each other; but as\r\nnothing but heaven is impregnable to vice, it will unavoidably\r\nhappen, that in proportion as they surmount the first difficulties\r\nof emigration, which bound them together in a common cause, they\r\nwill begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other; and\r\nthis remissness, will point out the necessity, of establishing some\r\nform of government to supply the defect of moral virtue.\r\n\r\nSome convenient tree will afford them a State-House, under the\r\nbranches of which, the whole colony may assemble to deliberate on\r\npublic matters. It is more than probable that their first laws will\r\nhave the title only of Regulations, and be enforced by no other\r\npenalty than public disesteem. In this first parliament every man,\r\nby natural right, will have a seat.\r\n\r\nBut as the colony increases, the public concerns will increase\r\nlikewise, and the distance at which the members may be separated,\r\nwill render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every\r\noccasion as at first, when their number was small, their habitations\r\nnear, and the public concerns few and trifling. This will point out\r\nthe convenience of their consenting to leave the legislative part to\r\nbe managed by a select number chosen from the whole body, who are\r\nsupposed to have the same concerns at stake which those who\r\nappointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the whole\r\nbody would act were they present. If the colony continue increasing,\r\nit will become necessary to augment the number of the\r\nrepresentatives, and that the interest of every part of the colony\r\nmay be attended to, it will be found best to divide the whole into\r\nconvenient parts, each part sending its proper number; and that the\r\nelected might never form to themselves an interest separate from the\r\nelectors, prudence will point out the propriety of having elections\r\noften; because as the elected might by that means return and mix\r\nagain with the general body of the electors in a few months, their\r\nfidelity to the public will be secured by the prudent reflexion of\r\nnot making a rod for themselves. And as this frequent interchange\r\nwill establish a common interest with every part of the community,\r\nthey will mutually and naturally support each other, and on this\r\n(not on the unmeaning name of king) depends the strength of\r\ngovernment, and the happiness of the governed.\r\n\r\nHere then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode\r\nrendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the\r\nworld; here too is the design and end of government, viz. freedom\r\nand security. And however our eyes may be dazzled with show, or our\r\nears deceived by sound; however prejudice may warp our wills, or\r\ninterest darken our understanding, the simple voice of nature and of\r\nreason will say, it is right.\r\n\r\nI draw my idea of the form of government from a principle in nature,\r\nwhich no art can overturn, viz. that the more simple any thing is,\r\nthe less liable it is to be disordered; and the easier repaired when\r\ndisordered; and with this maxim in view, I offer a few remarks on\r\nthe so much boasted constitution of England. That it was noble for\r\nthe dark and slavish times in which it was erected, is granted. When\r\nthe world was over run with tyranny the least remove therefrom was a\r\nglorious rescue. But that it is imperfect, subject to convulsions,\r\nand incapable of producing what it seems to promise, is easily\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nAbsolute governments (tho\' the disgrace of human nature) have this\r\nadvantage with them, that they are simple; if the people suffer,\r\nthey know the head from which their suffering springs, know likewise\r\nthe remedy, and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and cures.\r\nBut the constitution of England is so exceedingly complex, that the\r\nnation may suffer for years together without being able to discover\r\nin which part the fault lies, some will say in one and some in\r\nanother, and every political physician will advise a different\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nI know it is difficult to get over local or long standing prejudices,\r\nyet if we will suffer ourselves to examine the component parts of\r\nthe English constitution, we shall find them to be the base remains\r\nof two ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new republican\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nFirst.--The remains of monarchical tyranny in the person of the king.\r\n\r\nSecondly.--The remains of aristocratical tyranny in the persons of\r\nthe peers.\r\n\r\nThirdly.--The new republican materials, in the persons of the\r\ncommons, on whose virtue depends the freedom of England.\r\n\r\nThe two first, by being hereditary, are independent of the people;\r\nwherefore in a constitutional sense they contribute nothing towards\r\nthe freedom of the state.\r\n\r\nTo say that the constitution of England is a union of three powers \r\nreciprocally checking each other, is farcical, either the words have\r\nno meaning, or they are flat contradictions.\r\n\r\nTo say that the commons is a check upon the king, presupposes two\r\nthings:\r\n\r\nFirst.--That the king is not to be trusted without being looked\r\nafter, or in other words, that a thirst for absolute power is the\r\nnatural disease of monarchy.\r\n\r\nSecondly.--That the commons, by being appointed for that purpose,\r\nare either wiser or more worthy of confidence than the crown.\r\n\r\nBut as the same constitution which gives the commons a power to\r\ncheck the king by withholding the supplies, gives afterwards the\r\nking a power to check the commons, by empowering him to reject their\r\nother bills; it again supposes that the king is wiser than those \r\nwhom it has already supposed to be wiser than him. A mere absurdity!\r\n\r\nThere is something exceedingly ridiculous in the composition of\r\nmonarchy; it first excludes a man from the means of information, yet\r\nempowers him to act in cases where the highest judgment is required.\r\nThe state of a king shuts him from the world, yet the business of a\r\nking requires him to know it thoroughly; wherefore the different\r\nparts, by unnaturally opposing and destroying each other, prove the\r\nwhole character to be absurd and useless.\r\n\r\nSome writers have explained the English constitution thus; the king,\r\nsay they, is one, the people another; the peers are an house in\r\nbehalf of the king; the commons in behalf of the people; but this\r\nhath all the distinctions of a house divided against itself; and\r\nthough the expressions be pleasantly arranged, yet when examined\r\nthey appear idle and ambiguous; and it will always happen, that the\r\nnicest construction that words are capable of, when applied to the\r\ndescription of some thing which either cannot exist, or is too\r\nincomprehensible to be within the compass of description, will be\r\nwords of sound only, and though they may amuse the ear, they cannot\r\ninform the mind, for this explanation includes a previous question,\r\nviz. How came the king by a power which the people are afraid to\r\ntrust, and always obliged to check? Such a power could not be the\r\ngift of a wise people, neither can any power, which needs checking,\r\nbe from God; yet the provision, which the constitution makes,\r\nsupposes such a power to exist.\r\n\r\nBut the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot or\r\nwill not accomplish the end, and the whole affair is a felo de se;\r\nfor as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all\r\nthe wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to\r\nknow which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that\r\nwill govern; and though the others, or a part of them, may clog, or,\r\nas the phrase is, check the rapidity of its motion, yet so long as\r\nthey cannot stop it, their endeavors will be ineffectual; the first\r\nmoving power will at last have its way, and what it wants in speed\r\nis supplied by time.\r\n\r\nThat the crown is this overbearing part in the English constitution\r\nneeds not be mentioned, and that it derives its whole consequence\r\nmerely from being the giver of places and pensions is self-evident,\r\nwherefore, though we have been wise enough to shut and lock a door\r\nagainst absolute monarchy, we at the same time have been foolish\r\nenough to put the crown in possession of the key.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice of Englishmen, in favour of their own government by\r\nking, lords and commons, arises as much or more from national pride\r\nthan reason. Individuals are undoubtedly safer in England than in\r\nsome other countries, but the will of the king is as much the law of\r\nthe land in Britain as in France, with this difference, that instead\r\nof proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the people\r\nunder the more formidable shape of an act of parliament. For the\r\nfate of Charles the first, hath only made kings more subtle--not\r\nmore just.\r\n\r\nWherefore, laying aside all national pride and prejudice in favour\r\nof modes and forms, the plain truth is, that it is wholly owing to\r\nthe constitution of the people, and not to the constitution of the\r\ngovernment that the crown is not as oppressive in England as in\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the constitutional errors in the English form of\r\ngovernment is at this time highly necessary, for as we are never in\r\na proper condition of doing justice to others, while we continue\r\nunder the influence of some leading partiality, so neither are we\r\ncapable of doing it to ourselves while we remain fettered by any\r\nobstinate prejudice. And as a man, who is attached to a prostitute,\r\nis unfitted to choose or judge of a wife, so any prepossession in\r\nfavour of a rotten constitution of government will disable us from\r\ndiscerning a good one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF MONARCHY AND HEREDITARY SUCCESSION.\r\n\r\nMankind being originally equals in the order of creation, the\r\nequality could only be destroyed by some subsequent circumstance;\r\nthe distinctions of rich, and poor, may in a great measure be\r\naccounted for, and that without having recourse to the harsh ill\r\nsounding names of oppression and avarice. Oppression is often the\r\nconsequence, but seldom or never the means of riches; and though\r\navarice will preserve a man from being necessitously poor, it\r\ngenerally makes him too timorous to be wealthy.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and greater distinction for which no truly\r\nnatural or religious reason can be assigned, and that is, the\r\ndistinction of men into kings and subjects. Male and female are the\r\ndistinctions of nature, good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but\r\nhow a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest, and\r\ndistinguished like some new species, is worth enquiring into, and\r\nwhether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the early ages of the world, according to the scripture\r\nchronology, there were no kings; the consequence of which was there\r\nwere no wars; it is the pride of kings which throw mankind into\r\nconfusion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this\r\nlast century than any of the monarchial governments in Europe.\r\nAntiquity favors the same remark; for the quiet and rural lives of\r\nthe first patriarchs hath a happy something in them, which vanishes\r\naway when we come to the history of Jewish royalty.\r\n\r\nGovernment by kings was first introduced into the world by the\r\nHeathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom. It was\r\nthe most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the\r\npromotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine honors to their \r\ndeceased kings, and the christian world hath improved on the plan by\r\ndoing the same to their living ones. How impious is the title of\r\nsacred majesty applied to a worm, who in the midst of his splendor\r\nis crumbling into dust!\r\n\r\nAs the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be\r\njustified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be\r\ndefended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the Almighty,\r\nas declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly disapproves\r\nof government by kings. All anti-monarchical parts of scripture have\r\nbeen very smoothly glossed over in monarchical governments, but they\r\nundoubtedly merit the attention of countries which have their\r\ngovernments yet to form. "Render unto C\xc3\xa6sar the things which are\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\'s" is the scripture doctrine of courts, yet it is no support\r\nof monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a\r\nking, and in a state of vassalage to the Romans.\r\n\r\nNear three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of the\r\ncreation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a king.\r\nTill then their form of government (except in extraordinary cases,\r\nwhere the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic administred by\r\na judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it\r\nwas held sinful to acknowledge any being under that title but the\r\nLord of Hosts. And when a man seriously reflects on the idolatrous\r\nhomage which is paid to the persons of Kings, he need not wonder,\r\nthat the Almighty ever jealous of his honor, should disapprove of a\r\nform of government which so impiously invades the prerogative of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nMonarchy is ranked in scripture as one of the sins of the Jews, for\r\nwhich a curse in reserve is denounced against them. The history of\r\nthat transaction is worth attending to.\r\n\r\nThe children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon\r\nmarched against them with a small army, and victory, thro\' the\r\ndivine interposition, decided in his favour. The Jews elate with\r\nsuccess, and attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed\r\nmaking him a king, saying, Rule thou over us, thou and thy son and\r\nthy son\'s son. Here was temptation in its fullest extent; not a\r\nkingdom only, but an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his\r\nsoul replied, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule\r\nover you. The Lord shall rule over you. Words need not be more\r\nexplicit; Gideon doth not decline the honor, but denieth their right\r\nto give it; neither doth he compliment them with invented\r\ndeclarations of his thanks, but in the positive stile of a prophet\r\ncharges them with disaffection to their proper Sovereign, the King\r\nof heaven.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into\r\nthe same error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous\r\ncustoms of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but\r\nso it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel\'s two sons,\r\nwho were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an\r\nabrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, Behold thou art old,\r\nand thy sons walk not in thy ways, now make us a king to judge us\r\nlike all other nations. And here we cannot but observe that their\r\nmotives were bad, viz. that they might be like unto other nations,\r\ni.e. the Heathens, whereas their true glory laid in being as much\r\nunlike them as possible. But the thing displeased Samuel when they\r\nsaid, Give us a king to judge us; and Samuel prayed unto the Lord,\r\nand the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people\r\nin all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but\r\nthey have rejected me, THAT I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM. According\r\nto all the works which they have done since the day that I brought\r\nthem up out of Egypt, even unto this day; wherewith they have\r\nforsaken me and served other Gods; so do they also unto thee. Now\r\ntherefore hearken unto their voice, howbeit, protest solemnly unto\r\nthem and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them,\r\ni.e. not of any particular king, but the general manner of the kings\r\nof the earth, whom Israel was so eagerly copying after. And\r\nnotwithstanding the great distance of time and difference of manners,\r\nthe character is still in fashion. And Samuel told all the words of\r\nthe Lord unto the people, that asked of him a king. And he said,\r\nThis shall be the manner of the king that shall reign over you; he\r\nwill take your sons and appoint them for himself, for his chariots,\r\nand to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his chariots (this\r\ndescription agrees with the present mode of impressing men) and he\r\nwill appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties,\r\nand will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest, and to\r\nmake his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots; and he\r\nwill take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks and\r\nto be bakers (this describes the expence and luxury as well as the\r\noppression of kings) and he will take your fields and your olive\r\nyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants; and he\r\nwill take the tenth of your feed, and of your vineyards, and give\r\nthem to his officers and to his servants (by which we see that\r\nbribery, corruption and favoritism are the standing vices of kings)\r\nand he will take the tenth of your men servants, and your maid\r\nservants, and your goodliest young men and your asses, and put them\r\nto his work; and he will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall\r\nbe his servants, and ye shall cry out in that day because of your\r\nking which ye shall have chosen, and the Lord will not hear you in\r\nthat day. This accounts for the continuation of monarchy; neither do\r\nthe characters of the few good kings which have lived since, either\r\nsanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin; the\r\nhigh encomium given of David takes no notice of him officially as a\r\nking, but only as a man after God\'s own heart. Nevertheless the\r\nPeople refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and they said, Nay, but\r\nwe will have a king over us, that we may be like all the nations,\r\nand that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our\r\nbattles. Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he\r\nset before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and\r\nseeing them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, I will call\r\nunto the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain (which then was a\r\npunishment, being in the time of wheat harvest) that ye may perceive\r\nand see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the\r\nsight of the Lord, in asking you a king. So Samuel called unto the\r\nLord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day, and all the\r\npeople greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And all the people said\r\nunto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God that we die\r\nnot, for we have added unto our sins this evil, to ask a king. These\r\nportions of scripture are direct and positive. They admit of no\r\nequivocal construction. That the Almighty hath here entered his\r\nprotest against monarchical government is true, or the scripture is\r\nfalse. And a man hath good reason to believe that there is as much\r\nof king-craft, as priest-craft, in withholding the scripture from\r\nthe public in Popish countries. For monarchy in every instance is\r\nthe Popery of government.\r\n\r\nTo the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary succession;\r\nand as the first is a degradation and lessening of ourselves, so the\r\nsecond, claimed as a matter of right, is an insult and an imposition\r\non posterity. For all men being originally equals, no one by birth\r\ncould have a right to set up his own family in perpetual preference\r\nto all others for ever, and though himself might deserve some decent\r\ndegree of honors of his cotemporaries, yet his descendants might be\r\nfar too unworthy to inherit them. One of the strongest natural\r\nproofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature\r\ndisapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into\r\nridicule by giving mankind an ass for a lion.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as no man at first could possess any other public honors\r\nthan were bestowed upon him, so the givers of those honors could\r\nhave no power to give away the right of posterity, and though they\r\nmight say "We choose you for our head," they could not, without\r\nmanifest injustice to their children, say "that your children and\r\nyour children\'s children shall reign over ours for ever." Because\r\nsuch an unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the\r\nnext succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.\r\nMost wise men, in their private sentiments, have ever treated\r\nhereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which\r\nwhen once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear,\r\nothers from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the\r\nking the plunder of the rest.\r\n\r\nThis is supposing the present race of kings in the world to have had\r\nan honorable origin; whereas it is more than probable, that could we\r\ntake off the dark covering of antiquity, and trace them to their\r\nfirst rise, that we should find the first of them nothing better\r\nthan the principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage\r\nmanners or pre-eminence in subtility obtained him the title of chief\r\namong plunderers; and who by increasing in power, and extending his\r\ndepredations, over-awed the quiet and defenceless to purchase their\r\nsafety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no\r\nidea of giving hereditary right to his descendants, because such a\r\nperpetual exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free and\r\nunrestrained principles they professed to live by. Wherefore,\r\nhereditary succession in the early ages of monarchy could not take\r\nplace as a matter of claim, but as something casual or complimental;\r\nbut as few or no records were extant in those days, and traditional\r\nhistory stuffed with fables, it was very easy, after the lapse of a\r\nfew generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently\r\ntimed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of\r\nthe vulgar. Perhaps the disorders which threatened, or seemed to\r\nthreaten, on the decease of a leader and the choice of a new one\r\n(for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced\r\nmany at first to favor hereditary pretensions; by which means it\r\nhappened, as it hath happened since, that what at first was\r\nsubmitted to as a convenience, was afterwards claimed as a right.\r\n\r\nEngland, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs, but\r\ngroaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones; yet no man in his\r\nsenses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a\r\nvery honorable one. A French bastard landing with an armed banditti,\r\nand establishing himself king of England against the consent of the\r\nnatives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original.--It\r\ncertainly hath no divinity in it. However, it is needless to spend\r\nmuch time in exposing the folly of hereditary right; if there are\r\nany so weak as to believe it, let them promiscuously worship the ass\r\nand lion, and welcome. I shall neither copy their humility, nor\r\ndisturb their devotion.\r\n\r\nYet I should be glad to ask how they suppose kings came at first?\r\nThe question admits but of three answers, viz. either by lot, by\r\nelection, or by usurpation. If the first king was taken by lot, it\r\nestablishes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary\r\nsuccession. Saul was by lot, yet the succession was not hereditary,\r\nneither does it appear from that transaction there was any intention\r\nit ever should. If the first king of any country was by election,\r\nthat likewise establishes a precedent for the next; for to say, that\r\nthe right of all future generations is taken away, by the act of the\r\nfirst electors, in their choice not only of a king, but of a family\r\nof kings for ever, hath no parrallel in or out of scripture but the\r\ndoctrine of original sin, which supposes the free will of all men\r\nlost in Adam; and from such comparison, and it will admit of no\r\nother, hereditary succession can derive no glory. For as in Adam all\r\nsinned, and as in the first electors all men obeyed; as in the one\r\nall mankind were subjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty;\r\nas our innocence was lost in the first, and our authority in the\r\nlast; and as both disable us from reassuming some former state and\r\nprivilege, it unanswerably follows that original sin and hereditary\r\nsuccession are parellels. Dishonorable rank! Inglorious connexion!\r\nYet the most subtile sophist cannot produce a juster simile.\r\n\r\nAs to usurpation, no man will be so hardy as to defend it; and that\r\nWilliam the Conqueror was an usurper is a fact not to be\r\ncontradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English\r\nmonarchy will not bear looking into.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much the absurdity as the evil of hereditary\r\nsuccession which concerns mankind. Did it ensure a race of good and\r\nwise men it would have the seal of divine authority, but as it opens\r\na door to the foolish, the wicked, and the improper, it hath in it\r\nthe nature of oppression. Men who look upon themselves born to reign,\r\nand others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest of\r\nmankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the world\r\nthey act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they\r\nhave but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and when\r\nthey succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant and\r\nunfit of any throughout the dominions.\r\n\r\nAnother evil which attends hereditary succession is, that the throne\r\nis subject to be possessed by a minor at any age; all which time the\r\nregency, acting under the cover of a king, have every opportunity\r\nand inducement to betray their trust. The same national misfortune\r\nhappens, when a king worn out with age and infirmity, enters the\r\nlast stage of human weakness. In both these cases the public becomes\r\na prey to every miscreant, who can tamper successfully with the\r\nfollies either of age or infancy.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible plea, which hath ever been offered in favour of\r\nhereditary succession, is, that it preserves a nation from civil\r\nwars; and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas, it is the\r\nmost barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind. The whole history\r\nof England disowns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have\r\nreigned in that distracted kingdom since the conquest, in which time\r\nthere have been (including the Revolution) no less than eight civil\r\nwars and nineteen rebellions. Wherefore instead of making for peace,\r\nit makes against it, and destroys the very foundation it seems to\r\nstand on.\r\n\r\nThe contest for monarchy and succession, between the houses of York\r\nand Lancaster, laid England in a scene of blood for many years.\r\nTwelve pitched battles, besides skirmishes and sieges, were fought\r\nbetween Henry and Edward. Twice was Henry prisoner to Edward, who in\r\nhis turn was prisoner to Henry. And so uncertain is the fate of war\r\nand the temper of a nation, when nothing but personal matters are\r\nthe ground of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a\r\nprison to a palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a\r\nforeign land; yet, as sudden transitions of temper are seldom\r\nlasting, Henry in his turn was driven from the throne, and Edward\r\nrecalled to succeed him. The parliament always following the\r\nstrongest side.\r\n\r\nThis contest began in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and was not\r\nentirely extinguished till Henry the Seventh, in whom the families\r\nwere united. Including a period of 67 years, viz. from 1422 to 1489.\r\n\r\nIn short, monarchy and succession have laid (not this or that\r\nkingdom only) but the world in blood and ashes. \'Tis a form of\r\ngovernment which the word of God bears testimony against, and blood\r\nwill attend it.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire into the business of a king, we shall find that in\r\nsome countries they have none; and after sauntering away their lives\r\nwithout pleasure to themselves or advantage to the nation, withdraw\r\nfrom the scene, and leave their successors to tread the same idle\r\nround. In absolute monarchies the whole weight of business, civil\r\nand military, lies on the king; the children of Israel in their\r\nrequest for a king, urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go\r\nout before us and fight our battles." But in countries where he is\r\nneither a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled\r\nto know what is his business.\r\n\r\nThe nearer any government approaches to a republic the less business\r\nthere is for a king. It is somewhat difficult to find a proper name\r\nfor the government of England. Sir William Meredith calls it a\r\nrepublic; but in its present state it is unworthy of the name,\r\nbecause the corrupt influence of the crown, by having all the places\r\nin its disposal, hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and\r\neaten out the virtue of the house of commons (the republican part in\r\nthe constitution) that the government of England is nearly as\r\nmonarchical as that of France or Spain. Men fall out with names\r\nwithout understanding them. For it is the republican and not the\r\nmonarchical part of the constitution of England which Englishmen\r\nglory in, viz. the liberty of choosing a house of commons from out\r\nof their own body--and it is easy to see that when republican virtue\r\nfails, slavery ensues. Why is the constitution of England sickly,\r\nbut because monarchy hath poisoned the republic, the crown hath\r\nengrossed the commons?\r\n\r\nIn England a king hath little more to do than to make war and give\r\naway places; which in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation and\r\nset it together by the ears. A pretty business indeed for a man to\r\nbe allowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and\r\nworshipped into the bargain! Of more worth is one honest man to\r\nsociety and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that\r\never lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain\r\narguments, and common sense; and have no other preliminaries to\r\nsettle with the reader, than that he will divest himself of\r\nprejudice and prepossession, and suffer his reason and his feelings\r\nto determine for themselves; that he will put on, or rather that he\r\nwill not put off, the true character of a man, and generously\r\nenlarge his views beyond the present day.\r\n\r\nVolumes have been written on the subject of the struggle between\r\nEngland and America. Men of all ranks have embarked in the\r\ncontroversy, from different motives, and with various designs; but\r\nall have been ineffectual, and the period of debate is closed. Arms,\r\nas the last resource, decide the contest; the appeal was the choice\r\nof the king, and the continent hath accepted the challenge.\r\n\r\nIt hath been reported of the late Mr. Pelham (who tho\' an able\r\nminister was not without his faults) that on his being attacked in\r\nthe house of commons, on the score, that his measures were only of a\r\ntemporary kind, replied "they will last my time." Should a thought\r\nso fatal and unmanly possess the colonies in the present contest,\r\nthe name of ancestors will be remembered by future generations with\r\ndetestation.\r\n\r\nThe sun never shined on a cause of greater worth. \'Tis not the\r\naffair of a city, a country, a province, or a kingdom, but of a\r\ncontinent--of at least one eighth part of the habitable globe. \'Tis\r\nnot the concern of a day, a year, or an age; posterity are virtually\r\ninvolved in the contest, and will be more or less affected, even to\r\nthe end of time, by the proceedings now. Now is the seed time of\r\ncontinental union, faith and honor. The least fracture now will be\r\nlike a name engraved with the point of a pin on the tender rind of a\r\nyoung oak; the wound will enlarge with the tree, and posterity read\r\nit in full grown characters.\r\n\r\nBy referring the matter from argument to arms, a new \xc3\xa6ra for\r\npolitics is struck; a new method of thinking hath arisen. All plans,\r\nproposals, &amp;c. prior to the nineteenth of April, i.e. to the\r\ncommencement of hostilities, are like the almanacks of the last year;\r\nwhich, though proper then, are superseded and useless now. Whatever\r\nwas advanced by the advocates on either side of the question then,\r\nterminated in one and the same point, viz. a union with Great-\r\nBritain; the only difference between the parties was the method of\r\neffecting it; the one proposing force, the other friendship; but it\r\nhath so far happened that the first hath failed, and the second hath\r\nwithdrawn her influence.\r\n\r\nAs much hath been said of the advantages of reconciliation, which,\r\nlike an agreeable dream, hath passed away and left us as we were, it\r\nis but right, that we should examine the contrary side of the\r\nargument, and inquire into some of the many material injuries which\r\nthese colonies sustain, and always will sustain, by being connected\r\nwith, and dependant on Great-Britain. To examine that connexion and\r\ndependance, on the principles of nature and common sense, to see\r\nwhat we have to trust to, if separated, and what we are to expect,\r\nif dependant.\r\n\r\nI have heard it asserted by some, that as America hath flourished\r\nunder her former connexion with Great-Britain, that the same\r\nconnexion is necessary towards her future happiness, and will always\r\nhave the same effect. Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind\r\nof argument. We may as well assert that because a child has thrived\r\nupon milk, that it is never to have meat, or that the first twenty\r\nyears of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty. But\r\neven this is admitting more than is true, for I answer roundly, that\r\nAmerica would have flourished as much, and probably much more, had\r\nno European power had any thing to do with her. The commerce, by\r\nwhich she hath enriched herself are the necessaries of life, and\r\nwill always have a market while eating is the custom of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut she has protected us, say some. That she has engrossed us is\r\ntrue, and defended the continent at our expence as well as her own\r\nis admitted, and she would have defended Turkey from the same motive,\r\nviz. the sake of trade and dominion.\r\n\r\nAlas, we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made\r\nlarge sacrifices to superstition. We have boasted the protection of\r\nGreat-Britain, without considering, that her motive was interest not\r\nattachment; that she did not protect us from our enemies on our\r\naccount, but from her enemies on her own account, from those who had\r\nno quarrel with us on any other account, and who will always be our\r\nenemies on the same account. Let Britain wave her pretensions to the\r\ncontinent, or the continent throw off the dependance, and we should\r\nbe at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain. The\r\nmiseries of Hanover last war ought to warn us against connexions.\r\n\r\nIt has lately been asserted in parliament, that the colonies have no\r\nrelation to each other but through the parent country, i.e. that\r\nPennsylvania and the Jerseys, and so on for the rest, are sister\r\ncolonies by the way of England; this is certainly a very round-about\r\nway of proving relationship, but it is the nearest and only true way\r\nof proving enemyship, if I may so call it. France and Spain never\r\nwere, nor perhaps ever will be our enemies as Americans, but as our\r\nbeing the subjects of Great-Britain.\r\n\r\nBut Britain is the parent country, say some. Then the more shame\r\nupon her conduct. Even brutes do not devour their young, nor savages\r\nmake war upon their families; wherefore the assertion, if true,\r\nturns to her reproach; but it happens not to be true, or only partly\r\nso, and the phrase parent or mother country hath been jesuitically\r\nadopted by the king and his parasites, with a low papistical design\r\nof gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakness of our minds.\r\nEurope, and not England, is the parent country of America. This new\r\nworld hath been the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and\r\nreligious liberty from every part of Europe. Hither have they fled,\r\nnot from the tender embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of\r\nthe monster; and it is so far true of England, that the same tyranny\r\nwhich drove the first emigrants from home, pursues their descendants\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nIn this extensive quarter of the globe, we forget the narrow limits\r\nof three hundred and sixty miles (the extent of England) and carry\r\nour friendship on a larger scale; we claim brotherhood with every\r\nEuropean christian, and triumph in the generosity of the sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to observe by what regular gradations we surmount the\r\nforce of local prejudice, as we enlarge our acquaintance with the\r\nworld. A man born in any town in England divided into parishes, will\r\nnaturally associate most with his fellow parishioners (because their\r\ninterests in many cases will be common) and distinguish him by the\r\nname of neighbour; if he meet him but a few miles from home, he\r\ndrops the narrow idea of a street, and salutes him by the name of\r\ntownsman; if he travel out of the county, and meet him in any other,\r\nhe forgets the minor divisions of street and town, and calls him\r\ncountryman, i.e. county-man; but if in their foreign excursions they\r\nshould associate in France or any other part of Europe, their local\r\nremembrance would be enlarged into that of Englishmen. And by a just\r\nparity of reasoning, all Europeans meeting in America, or any other\r\nquarter of the globe, are countrymen; for England, Holland, Germany,\r\nor Sweden, when compared with the whole, stand in the same places on\r\nthe larger scale, which the divisions of street, town, and county do\r\non the smaller ones; distinctions too limited for continental minds.\r\nNot one third of the inhabitants, even of this province, are of\r\nEnglish descent. Wherefore I reprobate the phrase of parent or\r\nmother country applied to England only, as being false, selfish,\r\nnarrow and ungenerous.\r\n\r\nBut admitting, that we were all of English descent, what does it\r\namount to? Nothing. Britain, being now an open enemy, extinguishes\r\nevery other name and title: And to say that reconciliation is our\r\nduty, is truly farcical. The first king of England, of the present\r\nline (William the Conqueror) was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of\r\nEngland are descendants from the same country; therefore, by the\r\nsame method of reasoning, England ought to be governed by France.\r\n\r\nMuch hath been said of the united strength of Britain and the\r\ncolonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world.\r\nBut this is mere presumption; the fate of war is uncertain, neither\r\ndo the expressions mean any thing; for this continent would never\r\nsuffer itself to be drained of inhabitants, to support the British\r\narms in either Asia, Africa, or Europe.\r\n\r\nBesides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance? Our\r\nplan is commerce, and that, well attended to, will secure us the\r\npeace and friendship of all Europe; because, it is the interest of\r\nall Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a\r\nprotection, and her barrenness of gold and silver secure her from\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nI challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation, to shew, a\r\nsingle advantage that this continent can reap, by being connected\r\nwith Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a single advantage\r\nis derived. Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe,\r\nand our imported goods must be paid for buy them where we will.\r\n\r\nBut the injuries and disadvantages we sustain by that connection,\r\nare without number; and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to\r\nourselves, instruct us to renounce the alliance: Because, any\r\nsubmission to, or dependance on Great-Britain, tends directly to\r\ninvolve this continent in European wars and quarrels; and sets us at\r\nvariance with nations, who would otherwise seek our friendship, and\r\nagainst whom, we have neither anger nor complaint. As Europe is our\r\nmarket for trade, we ought to form no partial connection with any\r\npart of it. It is the true interest of America to steer clear of\r\nEuropean contentions, which she never can do, while by her\r\ndependence on Britain, she is made the make-weight in the scale of\r\nBritish politics.\r\n\r\nEurope is too thickly planted with kingdoms to be long at peace, and\r\nwhenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power, the\r\ntrade of America goes to ruin, because of her connection with\r\nBritain. The next war may not turn out like the last, and should it\r\nnot, the advocates for reconciliation now will be wishing for\r\nseparation then, because, neutrality in that case, would be a safer\r\nconvoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or natural\r\npleads for separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of\r\nnature cries, \'Tis time to part. Even the distance at which the\r\nAlmighty hath placed England and America, is a strong and natural\r\nproof, that the authority of the one, over the other, was never the\r\ndesign of Heaven. The time likewise at which the continent was\r\ndiscovered, adds weight to the argument, and the manner in which it\r\nwas peopled encreases the force of it. The reformation was preceded\r\nby the discovery of America, as if the Almighty graciously meant to\r\nopen a sanctuary to the persecuted in future years, when home should\r\nafford neither friendship nor safety.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Great-Britain over this continent, is a form of\r\ngovernment, which sooner or later must have an end: And a serious\r\nmind can draw no true pleasure by looking forward, under the painful\r\nand positive conviction, that what he calls "the present\r\nconstitution" is merely temporary. As parents, we can have no joy,\r\nknowing that this government is not sufficiently lasting to ensure\r\nany thing which we may bequeath to posterity: And by a plain method\r\nof argument, as we are running the next generation into debt, we\r\nought to do the work of it, otherwise we use them meanly and\r\npitifully. In order to discover the line of our duty rightly, we\r\nshould take our children in our hand, and fix our station a few\r\nyears farther into life; that eminence will present a prospect,\r\nwhich a few present fears and prejudices conceal from our sight.\r\n\r\nThough I would carefully avoid giving unnecessary offence, yet I am\r\ninclined to believe, that all those who espouse the doctrine of\r\nreconciliation, may be included within the following descriptions.\r\nInterested men, who are not to be trusted; weak men, who cannot see;\r\nprejudiced men, who will not see; and a certain set of moderate men,\r\nwho think better of the European world than it deserves; and this\r\nlast class, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be the cause of more\r\ncalamities to this continent, than all the other three.\r\n\r\nIt is the good fortune of many to live distant from the scene of\r\nsorrow; the evil is not sufficient brought to their doors to make\r\nthem feel the precariousness with which all American property is\r\npossessed. But let our imaginations transport us for a few moments\r\nto Boston, that seat of wretchedness will teach us wisdom, and\r\ninstruct us for ever to renounce a power in whom we can have no\r\ntrust. The inhabitants of that unfortunate city, who but a few\r\nmonths ago were in ease and affluence, have now, no other\r\nalternative than to stay and starve, or turn out to beg. Endangered\r\nby the fire of their friends if they continue within the city, and\r\nplundered by the soldiery if they leave it. In their present\r\ncondition they are prisoners without the hope of redemption, and in\r\na general attack for their relief, they would be exposed to the fury\r\nof both armies.\r\n\r\nMen of passive tempers look somewhat lightly over the offences of\r\nBritain, and, still hoping for the best, are apt to call out, "Come,\r\ncome, we shall be friends again, for all this." But examine the\r\npassions and feelings of mankind, Bring the doctrine of\r\nreconciliation to the touchstone of nature, and then tell me,\r\nwhether you can hereafter love, honour, and faithfully serve the\r\npower that hath carried fire and sword into your land? If you cannot\r\ndo all these, then are you only deceiving yourselves, and by your\r\ndelay bringing ruin upon posterity. Your future connection with\r\nBritain, whom you can neither love nor honour, will be forced and\r\nunnatural, and being formed only on the plan of present convenience,\r\nwill in a little time fall into a relapse more wretched than the\r\nfirst. But if you say, you can still pass the violations over, then\r\nI ask, Hath your house been burnt? Hath your property been destroyed\r\nbefore your face? Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to\r\nlie on, or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent or a child by\r\ntheir hands, and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor? If you\r\nhave not, then are you not a judge of those who have. But if you\r\nhave, and still can shake hands with the murderers, then are you\r\nunworthy of the name of husband, father, friend, or lover, and\r\nwhatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a\r\ncoward, and the spirit of a sycophant.\r\n\r\nThis is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by\r\nthose feelings and affections which nature justifies, and without\r\nwhich, we should be incapable of discharging the social duties of\r\nlife, or enjoying the felicities of it. I mean not to exhibit horror\r\nfor the purpose of provoking revenge, but to awaken us from fatal\r\nand unmanly slumbers, that we may pursue determinately some fixed\r\nobject. It is not in the power of Britain or of Europe to conquer\r\nAmerica, if she do not conquer herself by delay and timidity. The\r\npresent winter is worth an age if rightly employed, but if lost or\r\nneglected, the whole continent will partake of the misfortune; and\r\nthere is no punishment which that man will not deserve, be he who,\r\nor what, or where he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a\r\nseason so precious and useful.\r\n\r\nIt is repugnant to reason, to the universal order of things to all\r\nexamples from former ages, to suppose, that this continent can\r\nlonger remain subject to any external power. The most sanguine in\r\nBritain does not think so. The utmost stretch of human wisdom cannot,\r\nat this time, compass a plan short of separation, which can promise\r\nthe continent even a year\'s security. Reconciliation is now a\r\nfallacious dream. Nature hath deserted the connexion, and Art cannot\r\nsupply her place. For, as Milton wisely expresses, "never can true\r\nreconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so\r\ndeep."\r\n\r\nEvery quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual. Our prayers have\r\nbeen rejected with disdain; and only tended to convince us, that\r\nnothing flatters vanity, or confirms obstinacy in Kings more than\r\nrepeated petitioning--and nothing hath contributed more than that\r\nvery measure to make the Kings of Europe absolute: Witness Denmark\r\nand Sweden. Wherefore, since nothing but blows will do, for God\'s\r\nsake, let us come to a final separation, and not leave the next\r\ngeneration to be cutting throats, under the violated unmeaning names\r\nof parent and child.\r\n\r\nTo say, they will never attempt it again is idle and visionary, we\r\nthought so at the repeal of the stamp-act, yet a year or two\r\nundeceived us; as well may we suppose that nations, which have been\r\nonce defeated, will never renew the quarrel.\r\n\r\nAs to government matters, it is not in the power of Britain to do\r\nthis continent justice: The business of it will soon be too weighty,\r\nand intricate, to be managed with any tolerable degree of\r\nconvenience, by a power, so distant from us, and so very ignorant of\r\nus; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. To be\r\nalways running three or four thousand miles with a tale or a\r\npetition, waiting four or five months for an answer, which when\r\nobtained requires five or six more to explain it in, will in a few\r\nyears be looked upon as folly and childishness--There was a time\r\nwhen it was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cease.\r\n\r\nSmall islands not capable of protecting themselves, are the proper\r\nobjects for kingdoms to take under their care; but there is\r\nsomething very absurd, in supposing a continent to be perpetually\r\ngoverned by an island. In no instance hath nature made the satellite\r\nlarger than its primary planet, and as England and America, with\r\nrespect to each other, reverses the common order of nature, it is\r\nevident they belong to different systems: England to Europe, America\r\nto itself.\r\n\r\nI am not induced by motives of pride, party, or resentment to\r\nespouse the doctrine of separation and independance; I am clearly,\r\npositively, and conscientiously persuaded that it is the true\r\ninterest of this continent to be so; that every thing short of that\r\nis mere patchwork, that it can afford no lasting felicity,--that it\r\nis leaving the sword to our children, and shrinking back at a time,\r\nwhen, a little more, a little farther, would have rendered this\r\ncontinent the glory of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs Britain hath not manifested the least inclination towards a\r\ncompromise, we may be assured that no terms can be obtained worthy\r\nthe acceptance of the continent, or any ways equal to the expence of\r\nblood and treasure we have been already put to.\r\n\r\nThe object, contended for, ought always to bear some just proportion\r\nto the expence. The removal of North, or the whole detestable junto,\r\nis a matter unworthy the millions we have expended. A temporary\r\nstoppage of trade, was an inconvenience, which would have\r\nsufficiently ballanced the repeal of all the acts complained of, had\r\nsuch repeals been obtained; but if the whole continent must take up\r\narms, if every man must be a soldier, it is scarcely worth our while\r\nto fight against a contemptible ministry only. Dearly, dearly, do we\r\npay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for in\r\na just estimation, it is as great a folly to pay a Bunker-hill price\r\nfor law, as for land. As I have always considered the independancy\r\nof this continent, as an event, which sooner or later must arrive,\r\nso from the late rapid progress of the continent to maturity, the\r\nevent could not be far off. Wherefore, on the breaking out of\r\nhostilities, it was not worth the while to have disputed a matter,\r\nwhich time would have finally redressed, unless we meant to be in\r\nearnest; otherwise, it is like wasting an estate on a suit at law,\r\nto regulate the trespasses of a tenant, whose lease is just expiring.\r\nNo man was a warmer wisher for reconciliation than myself, before\r\nthe fatal nineteenth of April 1775, but the moment the event of that\r\nday was made known, I rejected the hardened, sullen tempered Pharaoh\r\nof England for ever; and disdain the wretch, that with the pretended\r\ntitle of father of his people can unfeelingly hear of their\r\nslaughter, and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event?\r\nI answer, the ruin of the continent. And that for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst. The powers of governing still remaining in the hands of the\r\nking, he will have a negative over the whole legislation of this\r\ncontinent. And as he hath shewn himself such an inveterate enemy to\r\nliberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power; is he, or\r\nis he not, a proper man to say to these colonies, "You shall make no\r\nlaws but what I please." And is there any inhabitant in America so\r\nignorant, as not to know, that according to what is called the\r\npresent constitution, that this continent can make no laws but what\r\nthe king gives leave to; and is there any man so unwise, as not to\r\nsee, that (considering what has happened) he will suffer no law to\r\nbe made here, but such as suit his purpose. We may be as effectually\r\nenslaved by the want of laws in America, as by submitting to laws\r\nmade for us in England. After matters are made up (as it is called)\r\ncan there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be\r\nexerted, to keep this continent as low and humble as possible?\r\nInstead of going forward we shall go backward, or be perpetually\r\nquarrelling or ridiculously petitioning.--We are already greater\r\nthan the king wishes us to be, and will he not hereafter endeavour\r\nto make us less? To bring the matter to one point. Is the power who\r\nis jealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us? Whoever\r\nsays No to this question is an independant, for independancy means\r\nno more, than, whether we shall make our own laws, or whether the\r\nking, the greatest enemy this continent hath, or can have, shall\r\ntell us "there shall be no laws but such as I like."\r\n\r\nBut the king you will say has a negative in England; the people\r\nthere can make no laws without his consent. In point of right and\r\ngood order, there is something very ridiculous, that a youth of\r\ntwenty-one (which hath often happened) shall say to several millions\r\nof people, older and wiser than himself, I forbid this or that act\r\nof yours to be law. But in this place I decline this sort of reply,\r\nthough I will never cease to expose the absurdity of it, and only\r\nanswer, that England being the King\'s residence, and America not so,\r\nmakes quite another case. The king\'s negative here is ten times more\r\ndangerous and fatal than it can be in England, for there he will\r\nscarcely refuse his consent to a bill for putting England into as\r\nstrong a state of defence as possible, and in America he would never\r\nsuffer such a bill to be passed.\r\n\r\nAmerica is only a secondary object in the system of British politics,\r\nEngland consults the good of this country, no farther than it\r\nanswers her own purpose. Wherefore, her own interest leads her to\r\nsuppress the growth of ours in every case which doth not promote her\r\nadvantage, or in the least interferes with it. A pretty state we\r\nshould soon be in under such a second-hand government, considering\r\nwhat has happened! Men do not change from enemies to friends by the\r\nalteration of a name: And in order to shew that reconciliation now\r\nis a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, that it would be policy in the\r\nking at this time, to repeal the acts for the sake of reinstating\r\nhimself in the government of the provinces; in order, that he may\r\naccomplish by craft and subtilty, in the long run, what he cannot do\r\nby force and violence in the short one. Reconciliation and ruin are\r\nnearly related.\r\n\r\nSecondly. That as even the best terms, which we can expect to obtain,\r\ncan amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of\r\ngovernment by guardianship, which can last no longer than till the\r\ncolonies come of age, so the general face and state of things, in\r\nthe interim, will be unsettled and unpromising. Emigrants of\r\nproperty will not choose to come to a country whose form of\r\ngovernment hangs but by a thread, and who is every day tottering on\r\nthe brink of commotion and disturbance; and numbers of the present\r\ninhabitants would lay hold of the interval, to dispense of their\r\neffects, and quit the continent.\r\n\r\nBut the most powerful of all arguments, is, that nothing but\r\nindependance, i.e. a continental form of government, can keep the\r\npeace of the continent and preserve it inviolate from civil wars. I\r\ndread the event of a reconciliation with Britain now, as it is more\r\nthan probable, that it will be followed by a revolt somewhere or\r\nother, the consequences of which may be far more fatal than all the\r\nmalice of Britain.\r\n\r\nThousands are already ruined by British barbarity; (thousands more\r\nwill probably suffer the same fate) Those men have other feelings\r\nthan us who have nothing suffered. All they now possess is liberty,\r\nwhat they before enjoyed is sacrificed to its service, and having\r\nnothing more to lose, they disdain submission. Besides, the general\r\ntemper of the colonies, towards a British government, will be like\r\nthat of a youth, who is nearly out of his time; they will care very\r\nlittle about her. And a government which cannot preserve the peace,\r\nis no government at all, and in that case we pay our money for\r\nnothing; and pray what is it that Britain can do, whose power will\r\nbe wholly on paper, should a civil tumult break out the very day\r\nafter reconciliation? I have heard some men say, many of whom I\r\nbelieve spoke without thinking, that they dreaded an independance,\r\nfearing that it would produce civil wars. It is but seldom that our\r\nfirst thoughts are truly correct, and that is the case here; for\r\nthere are ten times more to dread from a patched up connexion than \r\nfrom independance. I make the sufferers case my own, and I protest,\r\nthat were I driven from house and home, my property destroyed, and\r\nmy circumstances ruined, that as man, sensible of injuries, I could\r\nnever relish the doctrine of reconciliation, or consider myself\r\nbound thereby.\r\n\r\nThe colonies have manifested such a spirit of good order and\r\nobedience to continental government, as is sufficient to make every\r\nreasonable person easy and happy on that head. No man can assign the\r\nleast pretence for his fears, on any other grounds, than such as are\r\ntruly childish and ridiculous, viz. that one colony will be striving\r\nfor superiority over another.\r\n\r\nWhere there are no distinctions there can be no superiority, perfect\r\nequality affords no temptation. The republics of Europe are all (and\r\nwe may say always) in peace. Holland and Swisserland are without\r\nwars, foreign or domestic: Monarchical governments, it is true, are\r\nnever long at rest; the crown itself is a temptation to enterprizing\r\nruffians at home; and that degree of pride and insolence ever\r\nattendant on regal authority, swells into a rupture with foreign\r\npowers, in instances, where a republican government, by being formed\r\non more natural principles, would negociate the mistake.\r\n\r\nIf there is any true cause of fear respecting independance, it is\r\nbecause no plan is yet laid down. Men do not see their way out--\r\nWherefore, as an opening into that business, I offer the following\r\nhints; at the same time modestly affirming, that I have no other\r\nopinion of them myself, than that they may be the means of giving\r\nrise to something better. Could the straggling thoughts of\r\nindividuals be collected, they would frequently form materials for\r\nwise and able men to improve into useful matter.\r\n\r\nLet the assemblies be annual, with a President only. The\r\nrepresentation more equal. Their business wholly domestic, and\r\nsubject to the authority of a Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nLet each colony be divided into six, eight, or ten, convenient \r\ndistricts, each district to send a proper number of delegates to\r\nCongress, so that each colony send at least thirty. The whole number\r\nin Congress will be at least 390. Each Congress to sit and to choose\r\na president by the following method. When the delegates are met, let\r\na colony be taken from the whole thirteen colonies by lot, after\r\nwhich, let the whole Congress choose (by ballot) a president from\r\nout of the delegates of that province. In the next Congress, let a\r\ncolony be taken by lot from twelve only, omitting that colony from\r\nwhich the president was taken in the former Congress, and so\r\nproceeding on till the whole thirteen shall have had their proper\r\nrotation. And in order that nothing may pass into a law but what is\r\nsatisfactorily just, not less than three fifths of the Congress to\r\nbe called a majority.--He that will promote discord, under a\r\ngovernment so equally formed as this, would have joined Lucifer in\r\nhis revolt.\r\n\r\nBut as there is a peculiar delicacy, from whom, or in what manner,\r\nthis business must first arise, and as it seems most agreeable and\r\nconsistent that it should come from some intermediate body between\r\nthe governed and the governors, that is, between the Congress and\r\nthe people, let a Continental Conference be held, in the following\r\nmanner, and for the following purpose.\r\n\r\nA committee of twenty-six members of Congress, viz. two for each\r\ncolony. Two members from each House of Assembly, or Provincial\r\nConvention; and five representatives of the people at large, to be\r\nchosen in the capital city or town of each province, for, and in\r\nbehalf of the whole province, by as many qualified voters as shall\r\nthink proper to attend from all parts of the province for that\r\npurpose; or, if more convenient, the representatives may be chosen\r\nin two or three of the most populous parts thereof. In this\r\nconference, thus assembled, will be united, the two grand principles\r\nof business, knowledge and power. The members of Congress,\r\nAssemblies, or Conventions, by having had experience in national\r\nconcerns, will be able and useful counsellors, and the whole, being\r\nimpowered by the people, will have a truly legal authority.\r\n\r\nThe conferring members being met, let their business be to frame a\r\nContinental Charter, or Charter of the United Colonies; (answering\r\nto what is called the Magna Charta of England) fixing the number and\r\nmanner of choosing members of Congress, members of Assembly, with\r\ntheir date of sitting, and drawing the line of business and \r\njurisdiction between them: (Always remembering, that our strength is\r\ncontinental, not provincial:) Securing freedom and property to all\r\nmen, and above all things, the free exercise of religion, according\r\nto the dictates of conscience; with such other matter as is\r\nnecessary for a charter to contain. Immediately after which, the\r\nsaid Conference to dissolve, and the bodies which shall be chosen\r\ncomformable to the said charter, to be the legislators and governors\r\nof this continent for the time being: Whose peace and happiness, may\r\nGod preserve, Amen.\r\n\r\nShould any body of men be hereafter delegated for this or some\r\nsimilar purpose, I offer them the following extracts from that wise\r\nobserver on governments Dragonetti. "The science" says he "of the\r\npolitician consists in fixing the true point of happiness and\r\nfreedom. Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages, who should\r\ndiscover a mode of government that contained the greatest sum of\r\nindividual happiness, with the least national expense.\r\n\r\nDragonetti on virtue and rewards."\r\n\r\nBut where says some is the King of America? I\'ll tell you Friend, he\r\nreigns above, and doth not make havoc of mankind like the Royal\r\nBrute of Britain. Yet that we may not appear to be defective even in\r\nearthly honors, let a day be solemnly set apart for proclaiming the\r\ncharter; let it be brought forth placed on the divine law, the word\r\nof God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know,\r\nthat so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the law is\r\nking. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free\r\ncountries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.\r\nBut lest any ill use should afterwards arise, let the crown at the\r\nconclusion of the ceremony be demolished, and scattered among the\r\npeople whose right it is.\r\n\r\nA government of our own is our natural right: And when a man\r\nseriously reflects on the precariousness of human affairs, he will\r\nbecome convinced, that it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a\r\nconstitution of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have\r\nit in our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and\r\nchance. If we omit it now, some Massanello \xc2\xb9 may hereafter arise,\r\nwho laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the\r\ndesperate and the discontented, and by assuming to themselves the\r\npowers of government, may sweep away the liberties of the continent\r\nlike a deluge. Should the government of America return again into\r\nthe hands of Britain, the tottering situation of things, will be a\r\ntemptation for some desperate adventurer to try his fortune; and in\r\nsuch a case, what relief can Britain give? Ere she could hear the\r\nnews, the fatal business might be done; and ourselves suffering like\r\nthe wretched Britons under the oppression of the Conqueror. Ye that\r\noppose independance now, ye know not what ye do; ye are opening a\r\ndoor to eternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the seat of government.\r\nThere are thousands, and tens of thousands, who would think it\r\nglorious to expel from the continent, that barbarous and hellish\r\npower, which hath stirred up the Indians and Negroes to destroy us,\r\nthe cruelty hath a double guilt, it is dealing brutally by us, and\r\ntreacherously by them.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb9 Thomas Anello, otherwise Massanello, a fisherman of Naples, who\r\nafter spiriting up his countrymen in the public market place,\r\nagainst the oppressions of the Spaniards, to whom the place was then\r\nsubject, prompted them to revolt, and in the space of a day became\r\nking.\r\n\r\nTo talk of friendship with those in whom our reason forbids us to\r\nhave faith, and our affections wounded through a thousand pores\r\ninstruct us to detest, is madness and folly. Every day wears out the\r\nlittle remains of kindred between us and them, and can there be any\r\nreason to hope, that as the relationship expires, the affection will\r\nincrease, or that we shall agree better, when we have ten times more\r\nand greater concerns to quarrel over than ever?\r\n\r\nYe that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us\r\nthe time that is past? Can ye give to prostitution its former\r\ninnocence? Neither can ye reconcile Britain and America. The last\r\ncord now is broken, the people of England are presenting addresses\r\nagainst us. There are injuries which nature cannot forgive; she\r\nwould cease to be nature if she did. As well can the lover forgive\r\nthe ravisher of his mistress, as the continent forgive the murders\r\nof Britain. The Almighty hath implanted in us these unextinguishable\r\nfeelings for good and wise purposes. They are the guardians of his\r\nimage in our hearts. They distinguish us from the herd of common\r\nanimals. The social compact would dissolve, and justice be\r\nextirpated the earth, or have only a casual existence were we\r\ncallous to the touches of affection. The robber, and the murderer,\r\nwould often escape unpunished, did not the injuries which our\r\ntempers sustain, provoke us into justice.\r\n\r\nO ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny,\r\nbut the tyrant, stand forth! Every spot of the old world is overrun\r\nwith oppression. Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. Asia, and\r\nAfrica, have long expelled her--Europe regards her like a stranger,\r\nand England hath given her warning to depart. O! receive the\r\nfugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PRESENT ABILITY OF AMERICA,\r\nWITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS REFLEXIONS.\r\n\r\nI have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath\r\nnot confessed his opinion, that a separation between the countries,\r\nwould take place one time or other: And there is no instance, in\r\nwhich we have shewn less judgment, than in endeavouring to describe,\r\nwhat we call, the ripeness or fitness of the Continent for\r\nindependance.\r\n\r\nAs all men allow the measure, and vary only in their opinion of the\r\ntime, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey of\r\nthings, and endeavour, if possible, to find out the very time. But\r\nwe need not go far, the inquiry ceases at once, for, the time hath\r\nfound us. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things\r\nprove the fact.\r\n\r\nIt is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies;\r\nyet our present numbers are sufficient to repel the force of all the\r\nworld. The Continent hath, at this time, the largest body of armed\r\nand disciplined men of any power under Heaven; and is just arrived\r\nat that pitch of strength, in which no single colony is able to\r\nsupport itself, and the whole, when united, can accomplish the\r\nmatter, and either more, or, less than this, might be fatal in its\r\neffects. Our land force is already sufficient, and as to naval\r\naffairs, we cannot be insensible, that Britain would never suffer an\r\nAmerican man of war to be built, while the continent remained in her\r\nhands. Wherefore, we should be no forwarder an hundred years hence\r\nin that branch, than we are now; but the truth is, we should be less\r\nso, because the timber of the country is every day diminishing, and\r\nthat, which will remain at last, will be far off and difficult to\r\nprocure.\r\n\r\nWere the continent crowded with inhabitants, her sufferings under\r\nthe present circumstances would be intolerable. The more sea port\r\ntowns we had, the more should we have both to defend and to lose.\r\nOur present numbers are so happily proportioned to our wants, that\r\nno man need be idle. The diminution of trade affords an army, and\r\nthe necessities of an army create a new trade.\r\n\r\nDebts we have none; and whatever we may contract on this account\r\nwill serve as a glorious memento of our virtue. Can we but leave\r\nposterity with a settled form of government, an independant\r\nconstitution of its own, the purchase at any price will be cheap.\r\nBut to expend millions for the sake of getting a few vile acts\r\nrepealed, and routing the present ministry only, is unworthy the\r\ncharge, and is using posterity with the utmost cruelty; because it\r\nis leaving them the great work to do, and a debt upon their backs,\r\nfrom which they derive no advantage. Such a thought is unworthy a\r\nman of honor, and is the true characteristic of a narrow heart and a\r\npedling politician.\r\n\r\nThe debt we may contract doth not deserve our regard if the work be\r\nbut accomplished. No nation ought to be without a debt. A national\r\ndebt is a national bond; and when it bears no interest, is in no\r\ncase a grievance. Britain is oppressed with a debt of upwards of one\r\nhundred and forty millions sterling, for which she pays upwards of\r\nfour millions interest. And as a compensation for her debt, she has\r\na large navy; America is without a debt, and without a navy; yet for\r\nthe twentieth part of the English national debt, could have a navy\r\nas large again. The navy of England is not worth, at this time, more\r\nthan three millions and an half sterling.\r\n\r\nThe first and second editions of this pamphlet were published\r\nwithout the following calculations, which are now given as a proof\r\nthat the above estimation of the navy is just. See Entic\'s naval\r\nhistory, intro. page 56.\r\n\r\nThe charge of building a ship of each rate, and furnishing her with\r\nmasts, yards, sails and rigging, together with a proportion of eight\r\nmonths boatswain\'s and carpenter\'s sea-stores, as calculated by Mr.\r\nBurchett, Secretary to the navy.\r\n\r\n                                                   \xc2\xa3\r\n                                                [pounds\r\n                                                sterling]\r\nFor a ship of   100    guns              =      35,553\r\n                 90                      =      29,886\r\n                 80                      =      23,638\r\n                 70                      =      17,785\r\n                 60                      =      14,197\r\n                 50                      =      10,606\r\n                 40                      =       7,558\r\n                 30                      =       5,846\r\n                 20                      =       3,710\r\n\r\nAnd from hence it is easy to sum up the value, or cost rather, of\r\nthe whole British navy, which in the year 1757, when it was at its\r\ngreatest glory consisted of the following ships and guns:\r\n\r\nShips.

Tar, timber, iron, and\r\ncordage are her natural produce. We need go abroad for nothing.\r\nWhereas the Dutch, who make large profits by hiring out their ships\r\nof war to the Spaniards and Portuguese, are obliged to import most\r\nof the materials they use. We ought to view the building a fleet as\r\nan article of commerce, it being the natural manufactory of this\r\ncountry. It is the best money we can lay out. A navy when finished\r\nis worth more than it cost. And is that nice point in national\r\npolicy, in which commerce and protection are united. Let us build;\r\nif we want them not, we can sell; and by that means replace our\r\npaper currency with ready gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIn point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great errors;\r\nit is not necessary that one fourth part should be sailors. The\r\nTerrible privateer, Captain Death, stood the hottest engagement of\r\nany ship last war, yet had not twenty sailors on board, though her\r\ncomplement of men was upwards of two hundred. A few able and social\r\nsailors will soon instruct a sufficient number of active landmen in\r\nthe common work of a ship. Wherefore, we never can be more capable\r\nto begin on maritime matters than now, while our timber is standing,\r\nour fisheries blocked up, and our sailors and shipwrights out of\r\nemploy. Men of war, of seventy and eighty guns were built forty\r\nyears ago in New-England, and why not the same now? Ship-building is\r\nAmerica\'s greatest pride, and in which, she will in time excel the\r\nwhole world. The great empires of the east are mostly inland, and\r\nconsequently excluded from the possibility of rivalling her. Africa\r\nis in a state of barbarism; and no power in Europe, hath either such\r\nan extent of coast, or such an internal supply of materials. Where\r\nnature hath given the one, she has withheld the other; to America\r\nonly hath she been liberal of both. The vast empire of Russia is\r\nalmost shut out from the sea; wherefore, her boundless forests, her\r\ntar, iron, and cordage are only articles of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn point of safety, ought we to be without a fleet? We are not the\r\nlittle people now, which we were sixty years ago; at that time we\r\nmight have trusted our property in the streets, or fields rather;\r\nand slept securely without locks or bolts to our doors or windows.\r\nThe case now is altered, and our methods of defence, ought to\r\nimprove with our increase of property. A common pirate, twelve\r\nmonths ago, might have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of\r\nPhiladelphia under instant contribution, for what sum he pleased;\r\nand the same might have happened to other places. Nay, any daring\r\nfellow, in a brig of fourteen or sixteen guns, might have robbed the\r\nwhole Continent, and carried off half a million of money. These are\r\ncircumstances which demand our attention, and point out the\r\nnecessity of naval protection.\r\n\r\nSome, perhaps, will say, that after we have made it up with Britain,\r\nshe will protect us. Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall\r\nkeep a navy in our harbours for that purpose? Common sense will tell\r\nus, that the power which hath endeavoured to subdue us, is of all\r\nothers, the most improper to defend us. Conquest may be effected\r\nunder the pretence of friendship; and ourselves, after a long and\r\nbrave resistance, be at last cheated into slavery. And if her ships\r\nare not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to\r\nprotect us? A navy three or four thousand miles off can be of little\r\nuse, and on sudden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore, if we must\r\nhereafter protect ourselves, why not do it for ourselves? Why do it\r\nfor another?\r\n\r\nThe English list of ships of war, is long and formidable, but not a\r\ntenth part of them are at any one time fit for service, numbers of\r\nthem not in being; yet their names are pompously continued in the\r\nlist, if only a plank be left of the ship: and not a fifth part, of\r\nsuch as are fit for service, can be spared on any one station at one\r\ntime. The East and West Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other\r\nparts over which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon\r\nher navy. From a mixture of prejudice and inattention, we have\r\ncontracted a false notion respecting the navy of England, and have\r\ntalked as if we should have the whole of it to encounter at once,\r\nand for that reason, supposed, that we must have one as large; which\r\nnot being instantly practicable, have been made use of by a set of\r\ndisguised Tories to discourage our beginning thereon. Nothing can be\r\nfarther from truth than this; for if America had only a twentieth\r\npart of the naval force of Britain, she would be by far an over\r\nmatch for her; because, as we neither have, nor claim any foreign\r\ndominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coast, where\r\nwe should, in the long run, have two to one the advantage of those\r\nwho had three or four thousand miles to sail over, before they could\r\nattack us, and the same distance to return in order to refit and\r\nrecruit. And although Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our\r\ntrade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the West-\r\nIndies, which, by laying in the neighbourhood of the Continent, is\r\nentirely at its mercy.\r\n\r\nSome method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of\r\npeace, if we should not judge it necessary to support a constant\r\nnavy. If premiums were to be given to merchants, to build and employ\r\nin their service ships mounted with twenty, thirty, forty or fifty\r\nguns, (the premiums to be in proportion to the loss of bulk to the\r\nmerchants) fifty or sixty of those ships, with a few guardships on\r\nconstant duty, would keep up a sufficient navy, and that without\r\nburdening ourselves with the evil so loudly complained of in England,\r\nof suffering their fleet, in time of peace to lie rotting in the\r\ndocks. To unite the sinews of commerce and defense is sound policy;\r\nfor when our strength and our riches play into each other\'s hand, we\r\nneed fear no external enemy.\r\n\r\nIn almost every article of defense we abound. Hemp flourishes even\r\nto rankness, so that we need not want cordage. Our iron is superior\r\nto that of other countries. Our small arms equal to any in the world.\r\nCannon we can cast at pleasure. Saltpetre and gunpowder we are every\r\nday producing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Resolution is our\r\ninherent character, and courage hath never yet forsaken us.\r\nWherefore, what is it that we want? Why is it that we hesitate? From\r\nBritain we can expect nothing but ruin. If she is once admitted to\r\nthe government of America again, this Continent will not be worth\r\nliving in. Jealousies will be always arising; insurrections will be\r\nconstantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? Who will\r\nventure his life to reduce his own countrymen to a foreign obedience?\r\nThe difference between Pennsylvania and Connecticut, respecting some\r\nunlocated lands, shews the insignificance of a British government,\r\nand fully proves, that nothing but Continental authority can\r\nregulate Continental matters.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the present time is preferable to all others, is,\r\nthat the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet\r\nunoccupied, which instead of being lavished by the king on his\r\nworthless dependants, may be hereafter applied, not only to the\r\ndischarge of the present debt, but to the constant support of\r\ngovernment. No nation under heaven hath such an advantage as this.\r\n\r\nThe infant state of the Colonies, as it is called, so far from being\r\nagainst, is an argument in favour of independance. We are\r\nsufficiently numerous, and were we more so, we might be less united.\r\nIt is a matter worthy of observation, that the more a country is\r\npeopled, the smaller their armies are. In military numbers, the\r\nancients far exceeded the moderns: and the reason is evident. For\r\ntrade being the consequence of population, men become too much\r\nabsorbed thereby to attend to anything else. Commerce diminishes the\r\nspirit, both of patriotism and military defence. And history\r\nsufficiently informs us, that the bravest achievements were always\r\naccomplished in the non-age of a nation. With the increase of\r\ncommerce, England hath lost its spirit. The city of London,\r\nnotwithstanding its numbers, submits to continued insults with the\r\npatience of a coward. The more men have to lose, the less willing\r\nare they to venture. The rich are in general slaves to fear, and\r\nsubmit to courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a Spaniel.\r\n\r\nYouth is the seed time of good habits, as well in nations as in\r\nindividuals. It might be difficult, if not impossible, to form the\r\nContinent into one government half a century hence. The vast variety\r\nof interests, occasioned by an increase of trade and population,\r\nwould create confusion. Colony would be against colony. Each being\r\nable might scorn each other\'s assistance: and while the proud and\r\nfoolish gloried in their little distinctions, the wise would lament,\r\nthat the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the present\r\ntime is the true time for establishing it. The intimacy which is\r\ncontracted in infancy, and the friendship which is formed in\r\nmisfortune, are, of all others, the most lasting and unalterable.\r\nOur present union is marked with both these characters: we are young\r\nand we have been distressed; but our concord hath withstood our\r\ntroubles, and fixes a memorable area for posterity to glory in.\r\n\r\nThe present time, likewise, is that peculiar time, which never\r\nhappens to a nation but once, viz. the time of forming itself into a\r\ngovernment. Most nations have let slip the opportunity, and by that\r\nmeans have been compelled to receive laws from their conquerors,\r\ninstead of making laws for themselves. First, they had a king, and\r\nthen a form of government; whereas, the articles or charter of\r\ngovernment, should be formed first, and men delegated to execute\r\nthem afterward: but from the errors of other nations, let us learn\r\nwisdom, and lay hold of the present opportunity--To begin government\r\nat the right end.\r\n\r\nWhen William the Conqueror subdued England, he gave them law at the\r\npoint of the sword; and until we consent, that the seat of\r\ngovernment, in America, be legally and authoritatively occupied, we\r\nshall be in danger of having it filled by some fortunate ruffian,\r\nwho may treat us in the same manner, and then, where will be our\r\nfreedom? where our property?\r\n\r\nAs to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all\r\ngovernment, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I\r\nknow of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let\r\na man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of\r\nprinciple, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to\r\npart with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head.\r\nSuspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good\r\nsociety. For myself, I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is\r\nthe will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of\r\nreligious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our\r\nChristian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our\r\nreligious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this\r\nliberal principle, I look on the various denominations among us, to\r\nbe like children of the same family, differing only, in what is\r\ncalled, their Christian names.\r\n\r\nIn page forty, I threw out a few thoughts on the propriety of a\r\nContinental Charter, (for I only presume to offer hints, not plans)\r\nand in this place, I take the liberty of re-mentioning the subject,\r\nby observing, that a charter is to be understood as a bond of solemn\r\nobligation, which the whole enters into, to support the right of\r\nevery separate part, whether of religion, personal freedom, or\r\nproperty. A firm bargain and a right reckoning make long friends.\r\n\r\nIn a former page I likewise mentioned the necessity of a large and\r\nequal representation; and there is no political matter which more\r\ndeserves our attention. A small number of electors, or a small\r\nnumber of representatives, are equally dangerous. But if the number\r\nof the representatives be not only small, but unequal, the danger is\r\nincreased. As an instance of this, I mention the following; when the\r\nAssociators petition was before the House of Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania; twenty-eight members only were present, all the Bucks\r\ncounty members, being eight, voted against it, and had seven of the\r\nChester members done the same, this whole province had been governed\r\nby two counties only, and this danger it is always exposed to. The\r\nunwarrantable stretch likewise, which that house made in their last\r\nsitting, to gain an undue authority over the delegates of that\r\nprovince, ought to warn the people at large, how they trust power\r\nout of their own hands. A set of instructions for the Delegates were\r\nput together, which in point of sense and business would have\r\ndishonoured a schoolboy, and after being approved by a few, a very\r\nfew without doors, were carried into the House, and there passed in\r\nbehalf of the whole colony; whereas, did the whole colony know, with\r\nwhat ill-will that House hath entered on some necessary public\r\nmeasures, they would not hesitate a moment to think them unworthy of\r\nsuch a trust.\r\n\r\nImmediate necessity makes many things convenient, which if continued\r\nwould grow into oppressions. Expedience and right are different\r\nthings. When the calamities of America required a consultation,\r\nthere was no method so ready, or at that time so proper, as to\r\nappoint persons from the several Houses of Assembly for that purpose;\r\nand the wisdom with which they have proceeded hath preserved this\r\ncontinent from ruin. But as it is more than probable that we shall\r\nnever be without a Congress, every well wisher to good order, must\r\nown, that the mode for choosing members of that body, deserves\r\nconsideration. And I put it as a question to those, who make a study\r\nof mankind, whether representation and election is not too great a\r\npower for one and the same body of men to possess? When we are\r\nplanning for posterity, we ought to remember, that virtue is not\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\nIt is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are\r\nfrequently surprised into reason by their mistakes. Mr. Cornwall\r\n(one of the Lords of the Treasury) treated the petition of the New-\r\nYork Assembly with contempt, because that House, he said, consisted\r\nbut of twenty-six members, which trifling number, he argued, could\r\nnot with decency be put for the whole. We thank him for his\r\ninvoluntary honesty. \xc2\xb9\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb9 Those who would fully understand of what great consequence a large\r\nand equal representation is to a state, should read Burgh\'s\r\npolitical disquisitions.\r\n\r\nTo Conclude, however strange it may appear to some, or however\r\nunwilling they may be to think so, matters not, but many strong and\r\nstriking reasons may be given, to shew, that nothing can settle our\r\naffairs so expeditiously as an open and determined declaration for\r\nindependance. Some of which are,\r\n\r\nFirst.--It is the custom of nations, when any two are at war, for\r\nsome other powers, not engaged in the quarrel, to step in as\r\nmediators, and bring about the preliminaries of a peace: but while\r\nAmerica calls herself the Subject of Great-Britain, no power,\r\nhowever well disposed she may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore,\r\nin our present state we may quarrel on for ever.\r\n\r\nSecondly.--It is unreasonable to suppose, that France or Spain will\r\ngive us any kind of assistance, if we mean only, to make use of that\r\nassistance for the purpose of repairing the breach, and\r\nstrengthening the connection between Britain and America; because,\r\nthose powers would be sufferers by the consequences.\r\n\r\nThirdly.--While we profess ourselves the subjects of Britain, we\r\nmust, in the eye of foreign nations, be considered as rebels. The\r\nprecedent is somewhat dangerous to their peace, for men to be in\r\narms under the name of subjects; we, on the spot, can solve the\r\nparadox: but to unite resistance and subjection, requires an idea\r\nmuch too refined for common understanding.\r\n\r\nFourthly.--Were a manifesto to be published, and despatched to\r\nforeign courts, setting forth the miseries we have endured, and the\r\npeaceable methods we have ineffectually used for redress; declaring,\r\nat the same time, that not being able, any longer, to live happily\r\nor safely under the cruel disposition of the British court, we had\r\nbeen driven to the necessity of breaking off all connections with\r\nher; at the same time, assuring all such courts of our peaceable\r\ndisposition towards them, and of our desire of entering into trade\r\nwith them: Such a memorial would produce more good effects to this\r\nContinent, than if a ship were freighted with petitions to Britain.\r\n\r\nUnder our present denomination of British subjects, we can neither\r\nbe received nor heard abroad: The custom of all courts is against us,\r\nand will be so, until, by an independance, we take rank with other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings may at first appear strange and difficult; but,\r\nlike all other steps which we have already passed over, will in a\r\nlittle time become familiar and agreeable; and, until an\r\nindependance is declared, the Continent will feel itself like a man\r\nwho continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day,\r\nyet knows it must be done, hates to set about it, wishes it over,\r\nand is continually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the first edition of this pamphlet, or\r\nrather, on the same day on which it came out, the King\'s Speech made\r\nits appearance in this city. Had the spirit of prophecy directed the\r\nbirth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a\r\nmore seasonable juncture, or a more necessary time. The bloody\r\nmindedness of the one, shew the necessity of pursuing the doctrine\r\nof the other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, instead of\r\nterrifying, prepared a way for the manly principles of Independance.\r\n\r\nCeremony, and even, silence, from whatever motive they may arise,\r\nhave a hurtful tendency, when they give the least degree of\r\ncountenance to base and wicked performances; wherefore, if this\r\nmaxim be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King\'s Speech, as\r\nbeing a piece of finished villainy, deserved, and still deserves, a\r\ngeneral execration both by the Congress and the people. Yet, as the\r\ndomestic tranquillity of a nation, depends greatly, on the chastity\r\nof what may properly be called national manners, it is often better,\r\nto pass some things over in silent disdain, than to make use of such\r\nnew methods of dislike, as might introduce the least innovation, on\r\nthat guardian of our peace and safety. And, perhaps, it is chiefly\r\nowing to this prudent delicacy, that the King\'s Speech, hath not,\r\nbefore now, suffered a public execution. The Speech if it may be\r\ncalled one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel against\r\nthe truth, the common good, and the existence of mankind; and is a\r\nformal and pompous method of offering up human sacrifices to the\r\npride of tyrants. But this general massacre of mankind, is one of\r\nthe privileges, and the certain consequence of Kings; for as nature\r\nknows them not, they know not her, and although they are beings of\r\nour own creating, they know not us, and are become the gods of their\r\ncreators. The Speech hath one good quality, which is, that it is not\r\ncalculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived\r\nby it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it. It leaves us\r\nat no loss: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading,\r\nthat He, who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored\r\nIndian, is less a Savage than the King of Britain.\r\n\r\nSir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining jesuitical\r\npiece, fallaciously called, "The Address of the people of England to\r\nthe inhabitants of America," hath, perhaps, from a vain supposition,\r\nthat the people here were to be frightened at the pomp and\r\ndescription of a king, given, (though very unwisely on his part) the\r\nreal character of the present one: "But" says this writer, "if you\r\nare inclined to pay compliments to an administration, which we do\r\nnot complain of," (meaning the Marquis of Rockingham\'s at the repeal\r\nof the Stamp Act) "it is very unfair in you to withhold them from\r\nthat prince, by whose nod alone they were permitted to do any\r\nthing." This is toryism with a witness! Here is idolatry even\r\nwithout a mask: And he who can calmly hear, and digest such doctrine,\r\nhath forfeited his claim to rationality--an apostate from the order\r\nof manhood; and ought to be considered--as one, who hath not only\r\ngiven up the proper dignity of man, but sunk himself beneath the\r\nrank of animals, and contemptibly crawls through the world like a\r\nworm.\r\n\r\nHowever, it matters very little now, what the king of England either\r\nsays or does; he hath wickedly broken through every moral and human\r\nobligation, trampled nature and conscience beneath his feet; and by\r\na steady and constitutional spirit of insolence and cruelty,\r\nprocured for himself an universal hatred. It is now the interest of\r\nAmerica to provide for herself. She hath already a large and young\r\nfamily, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be\r\ngranting away her property, to support a power who is become a\r\nreproach to the names of men and christians--Ye, whose office it is\r\nto watch over the morals of a nation, of whatsoever sect or\r\ndenomination ye are of, as well as ye, who are more immediately the\r\nguardians of the public liberty, if ye wish to preserve your native\r\ncountry uncontaminated by European corruption, ye must in secret\r\nwish a separation--But leaving the moral part to private reflection,\r\nI shall chiefly confine my farther remarks to the following heads.\r\n\r\nFirst. That it is the interest of America to be separated from\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Which is the easiest and most practicable plan,\r\nreconciliation or independance? with some occasional remarks.\r\n\r\nIn support of the first, I could, if I judged it proper, produce the\r\nopinion of some of the ablest and most experienced men on this\r\ncontinent; and whose sentiments, on that head, are not yet publicly\r\nknown. It is in reality a self-evident position: For no nation in a\r\nstate of foreign dependance, limited in its commerce, and cramped\r\nand fettered in its legislative powers, can ever arrive at any\r\nmaterial eminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and\r\nalthough the progress which she hath made stands unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of other nations, it is but childhood, compared with what\r\nshe would be capable of arriving at, had she, as she ought to have,\r\nthe legislative powers in her own hands. England is, at this time,\r\nproudly coveting what would do her no good, were she to accomplish\r\nit; and the Continent hesitating on a matter, which will be her\r\nfinal ruin if neglected. It is the commerce and not the conquest of\r\nAmerica, by which England is to be benefited, and that would in a\r\ngreat measure continue, were the countries as independant of each\r\nother as France and Spain; because in many articles, neither can go\r\nto a better market. But it is the independance of this country of\r\nBritain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy\r\nof contention, and which, like all other truths discovered by\r\nnecessity, will appear clearer and stronger every day.\r\n\r\nFirst. Because it will come to that one time or other.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Because, the longer it is delayed the harder it will be to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nI have frequently amused myself both in public and private companies,\r\nwith silently remarking, the specious errors of those who speak\r\nwithout reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the\r\nfollowing seems the most general, viz. that had this rupture\r\nhappened forty or fifty years hence, instead of now, the Continent\r\nwould have been more able to have shaken off the dependance. To\r\nwhich I reply, that our military ability, at this time, arises from\r\nthe experience gained in the last war, and which in forty or fifty\r\nyears time, would have been totally extinct. The Continent, would\r\nnot, by that time, have had a General, or even a military officer\r\nleft; and we, or those who may succeed us, would have been as\r\nignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians: And this single\r\nposition, closely attended to, will unanswerably prove, that the\r\npresent time is preferable to all others. The argument turns thus--\r\nat the conclusion of the last war, we had experience, but wanted\r\nnumbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we should have numbers,\r\nwithout experience; wherefore, the proper point of time, must be\r\nsome particular point between the two extremes, in which a\r\nsufficiency of the former remains, and a proper increase of the\r\nlatter is obtained: And that point of time is the present time.\r\n\r\nThe reader will pardon this digression, as it does not properly come\r\nunder the head I first set out with, and to which I again return by\r\nthe following position, viz.\r\n\r\nShould affairs be patched up with Britain, and she to remain the\r\ngoverning and sovereign power of America, (which, as matters are now\r\ncircumstanced, is giving up the point intirely) we shall deprive\r\nourselves of the very means of sinking the debt we have, or may\r\ncontract. The value of the back lands which some of the provinces\r\nare clandestinely deprived of, by the unjust extention of the limits\r\nof Canada, valued only at five pounds sterling per hundred acres,\r\namount to upwards of twenty-five millions, Pennsylvania currency;\r\nand the quit-rents at one penny sterling per acre, to two millions\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nIt is by the sale of those lands that the debt may be sunk, without\r\nburthen to any, and the quit-rent reserved thereon, will always\r\nlessen, and in time, will wholly support the yearly expence of\r\ngovernment. It matters not how long the debt is in paying, so that\r\nthe lands when sold be applied to the discharge of it, and for the\r\nexecution of which, the Congress for the time being, will be the\r\ncontinental trustees.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the second head, viz. Which is the easiest and most\r\npracticable plan, reconciliation or independance; with some\r\noccasional remarks.\r\n\r\nHe who takes nature for his guide is not easily beaten out of his \r\nargument, and on that ground, I answer generally--That independance\r\nbeing a single simple line, contained within ourselves; and\r\nreconciliation, a matter exceedingly perplexed and complicated, and\r\nin which, a treacherous capricious court is to interfere, gives the\r\nanswer without a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe present state of America is truly alarming to every man who is\r\ncapable of reflexion. Without law, without government, without any\r\nother mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courtesy.\r\nHeld together by an unexampled concurrence of sentiment, which is\r\nnevertheless subject to change, and which every secret enemy is\r\nendeavouring to dissolve. Our present condition, is, Legislation\r\nwithout law; wisdom without a plan; constitution without a name; and,\r\nwhat is strangely astonishing, perfect Independance contending for\r\ndependance. The instance is without a precedent; the case never\r\nexisted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property\r\nof no man is secure in the present unbraced system of things. The\r\nmind of the multitude is left at random, and seeing no fixed object\r\nbefore them, they pursue such as fancy or opinion starts. Nothing is\r\ncriminal; there is no such thing as treason; wherefore, every one\r\nthinks himself at liberty to act as he pleases. The Tories dared not\r\nhave assembled offensively, had they known that their lives, by that\r\nact, were forfeited to the laws of the state. A line of distinction\r\nshould be drawn, between, English soldiers taken in battle, and\r\ninhabitants of America taken in arms. The first are prisoners, but\r\nthe latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our wisdom, there is a visible feebleness in some of\r\nour proceedings which gives encouragement to dissensions. The\r\nContinental Belt is too loosely buckled. And if something is not\r\ndone in time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we shall fall\r\ninto a state, in which, neither Reconciliation nor Independance will\r\nbe practicable. The king and his worthless adherents are got at\r\ntheir old game of dividing the Continent, and there are not wanting\r\namong us, Printers, who will be busy in spreading specious\r\nfalsehoods. The artful and hypocritical letter which appeared a few\r\nmonths ago in two of the New-York papers, and likewise in two others,\r\nis an evidence that there are men who want either judgment or\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\nIt is easy getting into holes and corners and talking of\r\nreconciliation: But do such men seriously consider, how difficult\r\nthe task is, and how dangerous it may prove, should the Continent\r\ndivide thereon. Do they take within their view, all the various\r\norders of men whose situation and circumstances, as well as their\r\nown, are to be considered therein. Do they put themselves in the\r\nplace of the sufferer whose all is already gone, and of the soldier,\r\nwho hath quitted all for the defence of his country. If their ill\r\njudged moderation be suited to their own private situations only,\r\nregardless of others, the event will convince them, that "they are\r\nreckoning without their Host."\r\n\r\nPut us, say some, on the footing we were on in sixty-three: To which\r\nI answer, the request is not now in the power of Britain to comply\r\nwith, neither will she propose it; but if it were, and even should\r\nbe granted, I ask, as a reasonable question, By what means is such a\r\ncorrupt and faithless court to be kept to its engagements? Another\r\nparliament, nay, even the present, may hereafter repeal the\r\nobligation, on the pretence, of its being violently obtained, or\r\nunwisely granted; and in that case, Where is our redress?--No going\r\nto law with nations; cannon are the barristers of Crowns; and the\r\nsword, not of justice, but of war, decides the suit. To be on the\r\nfooting of sixty-three, it is not sufficient, that the laws only be\r\nput on the same state, but, that our circumstances, likewise, be put\r\non the same state; Our burnt and destroyed towns repaired or built\r\nup, our private losses made good, our public debts (contracted for\r\ndefence) discharged; otherwise, we shall be millions worse than we\r\nwere at that enviable period. Such a request, had it been complied\r\nwith a year ago, would have won the heart and soul of the Continent-\r\n-but now it is too late, "The Rubicon is passed."\r\n\r\nBesides, the taking up arms, merely to enforce the repeal of a\r\npecuniary law, seems as unwarrantable by the divine law, and as\r\nrepugnant to human feelings, as the taking up arms to enforce\r\nobedience thereto. The object, on either side, doth not justify the\r\nmeans; for the lives of men are too valuable to be cast away on such\r\ntrifles. It is the violence which is done and threatened to our\r\npersons; the destruction of our property by an armed force; the\r\ninvasion of our country by fire and sword, which conscientiously\r\nqualifies the use of arms: And the instant, in which such a mode of\r\ndefence became necessary, all subjection to Britain ought to have\r\nceased; and the independancy of America, should have been considered,\r\nas dating its \xc3\xa6ra from, and published by, the first musket that was\r\nfired against her. This line is a line of consistency; neither drawn\r\nby caprice, nor extended by ambition; but produced by a chain of\r\nevents, of which the colonies were not the authors.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude these remarks, with the following timely and well\r\nintended hints. We ought to reflect, that there are three different\r\nways, by which an independancy may hereafter be effected; and that\r\none of those three, will one day or other, be the fate of America,\r\nviz. By the legal voice of the people in Congress; by a military\r\npower; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our soldiers are\r\ncitizens, and the multitude a body of reasonable men; virtue, as I\r\nhave already remarked, is not hereditary, neither is it perpetual.\r\nShould an independancy be brought about by the first of those means,\r\nwe have every opportunity and every encouragement before us, to form\r\nthe noblest purest constitution on the face of the earth. We have it\r\nin our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to\r\nthe present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The\r\nbirthday of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as\r\nnumerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of\r\nfreedom from the event of a few months. The Reflexion is awful--and\r\nin this point of view, How trifling, how ridiculous, do the little,\r\npaltry cavellings, of a few weak or interested men appear, when\r\nweighed against the business of a world.\r\n\r\nShould we neglect the present favorable and inviting period, and an\r\nIndependance be hereafter effected by any other means, we must\r\ncharge the consequence to ourselves, or to those rather, whose\r\nnarrow and prejudiced souls, are habitually opposing the measure,\r\nwithout either inquiring or reflecting. There are reasons to be\r\ngiven in support of Independance, which men should rather privately\r\nthink of, than be publicly told of. We ought not now to be debating\r\nwhether we shall be independant or not, but, anxious to accomplish\r\nit on a firm, secure, and honorable basis, and uneasy rather that it\r\nis not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its necessity. Even\r\nthe Tories (if such beings yet remain among us) should, of all men,\r\nbe the most solicitous to promote it; for, as the appointment of\r\ncommittees at first, protected them from popular rage, so, a wise\r\nand well established form of government, will be the only certain\r\nmeans of continuing it securely to them. Wherefore, if they have not\r\nvirtue enough to be Whigs, they ought to have prudence enough to\r\nwish for Independance.\r\n\r\nIn short, Independance is the only Bond that can tye and keep us\r\ntogether. We shall then see our object, and our ears will be legally\r\nshut against the schemes of an intriguing, as well, as a cruel enemy.\r\nWe shall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain;\r\nfor there is reason to conclude, that the pride of that court, will\r\nbe less hurt by treating with the American states for terms of peace,\r\nthan with those, whom she denominates, "rebellious subjects," for\r\nterms of accommodation. It is our delaying it that encourages her to\r\nhope for conquest, and our backwardness tends only to prolong the\r\nwar. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, withheld our\r\ntrade to obtain a redress of our grievances, let us now try the\r\nalternative, by independantly redressing them ourselves, and then\r\noffering to open the trade. The mercantile and reasonable part in\r\nEngland, will be still with us; because, peace with trade, is\r\npreferable to war without it. And if this offer be not accepted,\r\nother courts may be applied to.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds I rest the matter. And as no offer hath yet been\r\nmade to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this\r\npamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be\r\nrefuted, or, that the party in favour of it are too numerous to be\r\nopposed. Wherefore, instead of gazing at each other with suspicious\r\nor doubtful curiosity; let each of us, hold out to his neighbour the\r\nhearty hand of friendship, and unite in drawing a line, which, like\r\nan act of oblivion shall bury in forgetfulness every former\r\ndissension. Let the names of Whig and Tory be extinct; and let none\r\nother be heard among us, than those of a good citizen, an open and\r\nresolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of mankind\r\nand of the FREE AND INDEPENDANT STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nTo the Representatives of the Religious Society of the People called\r\nQuakers, or to so many of them as were concerned in publishing the\r\nlate piece, entitled "The Ancient Testimony and Principles of the\r\nPeople called Quakers renewed, with Respect to the King and\r\nGovernment, and touching the Commotions now prevailing in these and\r\nother parts of America addressed to the People in General."\r\n\r\nThe Writer of this, is one of those few, who never dishonours\r\nreligion either by ridiculing, or cavilling at any denomination\r\nwhatsoever. To God, and not to man, are all men accountable on the\r\nscore of religion. Wherefore, this epistle is not so properly\r\naddressed to you as a religious, but as a political body, dabbling\r\nin matters, which the professed Quietude of your Principles instruct\r\nyou not to meddle with.\r\n\r\nAs you have, without a proper authority for so doing, put yourselves\r\nin the place of the whole body of the Quakers, so, the writer of\r\nthis, in order to be on an equal rank with yourselves, is under the\r\nnecessity, of putting himself in the place of all those, who,\r\napprove the very writings and principles, against which your\r\ntestimony is directed: And he hath chosen this singular situation,\r\nin order, that you might discover in him that presumption of\r\ncharacter which you cannot see in yourselves. For neither he nor you\r\ncan have any claim or title to Political Representation.\r\n\r\nWhen men have departed from the right way, it is no wonder that they\r\nstumble and fall. And it is evident from the manner in which ye have\r\nmanaged your testimony, that politics, (as a religious body of men)\r\nis not your proper Walk; for however well adapted it might appear to\r\nyou, it is, nevertheless, a jumble of good and bad put unwisely\r\ntogether, and the conclusion drawn therefrom, both unnatural and\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\nThe two first pages, (and the whole doth not make four) we give you\r\ncredit for, and expect the same civility from you, because the love\r\nand desire of peace is not confined to Quakerism, it is the natural,\r\nas well the religious wish of all denominations of men. And on this\r\nground, as men labouring to establish an Independant Constitution of\r\nour own, do we exceed all others in our hope, end, and aim. Our plan\r\nis peace for ever. We are tired of contention with Britain, and can\r\nsee no real end to it but in a final separation. We act consistently,\r\nbecause for the sake of introducing an endless and uninterrupted\r\npeace, do we bear the evils and burthens of the present day. We are\r\nendeavoring, and will steadily continue to endeavour, to separate\r\nand dissolve a connexion which hath already filled our land with\r\nblood; and which, while the name of it remains, will be the fatal\r\ncause of future mischiefs to both countries.\r\n\r\nWe fight neither for revenge nor conquest; neither from pride nor\r\npassion; we are not insulting the world with our fleets and armies,\r\nnor ravaging the globe for plunder. Beneath the shade of our own\r\nvines are we attacked; in our own houses, and on our own lands, is\r\nthe violence committed against us. We view our enemies in the\r\ncharacter of Highwaymen and Housebreakers, and having no defence for\r\nourselves in the civil law, are obliged to punish them by the\r\nmilitary one, and apply the sword, in the very case, where you have\r\nbefore now, applied the halter--Perhaps we feel for the ruined and\r\ninsulted sufferers in all and every part of the continent, with a\r\ndegree of tenderness which hath not yet made its way into some of\r\nyour bosoms. But be ye sure that ye mistake not the cause and ground\r\nof your Testimony. Call not coldness of soul, religion; nor put the\r\nBigot in the place of the Christian.\r\n\r\nO ye partial ministers of your own acknowledged principles. If the\r\nbearing arms be sinful, the first going to war must be more so, by\r\nall the difference between wilful attack and unavoidable defence.\r\nWherefore, if ye really preach from conscience, and mean not to make\r\na political hobby-horse of your religion, convince the world thereof,\r\nby proclaiming your doctrine to our enemies, for they likewise bear\r\narms. Give us proof of your sincerity by publishing it at St.\r\nJames\'s, to the commanders in chief at Boston, to the Admirals and\r\nCaptains who are piratically ravaging our coasts, and to all the\r\nmurdering miscreants who are acting in authority under him whom ye\r\nprofess to serve. Had ye the honest soul of Barclay \xc2\xb9 ye would\r\npreach repentance to your king; Ye would tell the Royal Wretch his\r\nsins, and warn him of eternal ruin. Ye would not spend your partial\r\ninvectives against the injured and the insulted only, but, like\r\nfaithful ministers, would cry aloud and spare none. Say not that ye\r\nare persecuted, neither endeavour to make us the authors of that\r\nreproach, which, ye are bringing upon yourselves; for we testify\r\nunto all men, that we do not complain against you because ye are\r\nQuakers, but because ye pretend to be and are not Quakers.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xb9"Thou hast tasted of prosperity and adversity; thou knowest what it\r\nis to be banished thy native country, to be over-ruled as well as to\r\nrule, and set upon the throne; and being oppressed thou hast reason\r\nto know how hateful the oppressor is both to God and man: If after\r\nall these warnings and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the\r\nLord with all thy heart, but forget him who remembered thee in thy\r\ndistress, and give up thyself to follow lust and vanity, surely\r\ngreat will be thy condemnation.--Against which snare, as well as the\r\ntemptation of those who may or do feed thee, and prompt thee to evil,\r\nthe most excellent and prevalent remedy will be, to apply thyself to\r\nthat light of Christ which shineth in thy conscience, and which\r\nneither can, nor will flatter thee, nor suffer thee to be at ease in\r\nthy sins."\r\n\r\n--Barclay\'s address to Charles II.\r\n\r\nAlas! it seems by the particular tendency of some part of your\r\ntestimony, and other parts of your conduct, as if, all sin was\r\nreduced to, and comprehended in, the act of bearing arms, and that\r\nby the people only. Ye appear to us, to have mistaken party for\r\nconscience; because, the general tenor of your actions wants\r\nuniformity: And it is exceedingly difficult to us to give credit to\r\nmany of your pretended scruples; because, we see them made by the\r\nsame men, who, in the very instant that they are exclaiming against\r\nthe mammon of this world, are nevertheless, hunting after it with a\r\nstep as steady as Time, and an appetite as keen as Death.\r\n\r\nThe quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of\r\nyour testimony, that, "when a man\'s ways please the Lord, he maketh\r\neven his enemies to be at peace with him"; is very unwisely chosen\r\non your part; because, it amounts to a proof, that the king\'s ways\r\n(whom ye are desirous of supporting) do not please the Lord,\r\notherwise, his reign would be in peace.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to the latter part of your testimony, and that, for\r\nwhich all the foregoing seems only an introduction, viz.\r\n\r\n"It hath ever been our judgment and principle, since we were called\r\nto profess the light of Christ Jesus, manifested in our consciences\r\nunto this day, that the setting up and putting down kings and\r\ngovernments, is God\'s peculiar prerogative; for causes best known to\r\nhimself: And that it is not our business to have any hand or\r\ncontrivance therein; nor to be busy bodies above our station, much\r\nless to plot and contrive the ruin, or overturn of any of them, but\r\nto pray for the king, and safety of our nation, and good of all men:\r\nThat we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godliness and\r\nhonesty; under the government which God is pleased to set over us."-\r\n-If these are really your principles why do ye not abide by them?\r\nWhy do ye not leave that, which ye call God\'s Work, to be managed by\r\nhimself? These very principles instruct you to wait with patience\r\nand humility, for the event of all public measures, and to receive\r\nthat event as the divine will towards you. Wherefore, what occasion\r\nis there for your political testimony if you fully believe what it\r\ncontains: And the very publishing it proves, that either, ye do not\r\nbelieve what ye profess, or have not virtue enough to practise what\r\nye believe.\r\n\r\nThe principles of Quakerism have a direct tendency to make a man the\r\nquiet and inoffensive subject of any, and every government which is\r\nset over him. And if the setting up and putting down of kings and\r\ngovernments is God\'s peculiar prerogative, he most certainly will\r\nnot be robbed thereof by us; wherefore, the principle itself leads\r\nyou to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to\r\nkings as being his work. Oliver Cromwell thanks you. Charles, then,\r\ndied not by the hands of man; and should the present Proud Imitator\r\nof him, come to the same untimely end, the writers and publishers of\r\nthe Testimony, are bound, by the doctrine it contains, to applaud\r\nthe fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes\r\nin governments brought about by any other means than such as are\r\ncommon and human; and such as we are now using. Even the dispersion\r\nof the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms.\r\nWherefore, as ye refuse to be the means on one side, ye ought not to\r\nbe meddlers on the other; but to wait the issue in silence; and\r\nunless ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty\r\nwho hath created and placed this new world, at the greatest distance\r\nit could possibly stand, east and west, from every part of the old,\r\ndoth, nevertheless, disapprove of its being independant of the\r\ncorrupt and abandoned court of Britain, unless I say, ye can shew\r\nthis, how can ye on the ground of your principles, justify the\r\nexciting and stirring up the people "firmly to unite in the\r\nabhorrence of all such writings, and measures, as evidence a desire\r\nand design to break off the happy connexion we have hitherto enjoyed,\r\nwith the kingdom of Great-Britain, and our just and necessary\r\nsubordination to the king, and those who are lawfully placed in\r\nauthority under him." What a slap of the face is here! the men, who\r\nin the very paragraph before, have quietly and passively resigned up\r\nthe ordering, altering, and disposal of kings and governments, into\r\nthe hands of God, are now, recalling their principles, and putting\r\nin for a share of the business. Is it possible, that the conclusion,\r\nwhich is here justly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine\r\nlaid down? The inconsistency is too glaring not to be seen; the\r\nabsurdity too great not to be laughed at; and such as could only\r\nhave been made by those, whose understandings were darkened by the\r\nnarrow and crabby spirit of a despairing political party; for ye are\r\nnot to be considered as the whole body of the Quakers but only as a\r\nfactional and fractional part thereof.\r\n\r\nHere ends the examination of your testimony; (which I call upon no\r\nman to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;)\r\nto which I subjoin the following remark; "That the setting up and\r\nputting down of kings," most certainly mean, the making him a king,\r\nwho is yet not so, and the making him no king who is already one.\r\nAnd pray what hath this to do in the present case? We neither mean\r\nto set up nor to put down, neither to make nor to unmake, but to\r\nhave nothing to do with them. Wherefore, your testimony in whatever\r\nlight it is viewed serves only to dishonor your judgement, and for\r\nmany other reasons had better have been let alone than published.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because it tends to the decrease and reproach of all religion\r\nwhatever, and is of the utmost danger to society, to make it a party\r\nin political disputes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom disavow\r\nthe publishing political testimonies, as being concerned therein and\r\napprovers thereof.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Because it hath a tendency to undo that continental harmony\r\nand friendship which yourselves by your late liberal and charitable\r\ndonations hath lent a hand to establish; and the preservation of\r\nwhich is of the utmost consequence to us all.\r\n\r\nAnd here without anger or resentment I bid you farewell. Sincerely\r\nwishing, that as men and christians, ye may always fully and\r\nuninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right; and be, in\r\nyour turn, the means of securing it to others; but that the example\r\nwhich ye have unwisely set, of mingling religion with politics, may\r\nbe disavowed and reprobated by every inhabitant of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF  I  N  I  S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Common Sense\r\n\r\n"No writer has exceeded Paine in ease and familiarity of style, in\r\nperspicuity of expression, happiness of elucidation, and in simple\r\nand unassuming language."\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\n\r\n"A pamphlet called \'Commonsense\' makes a great noise.
