Yet Augustus was the most successful ruler known to us.\r\nHe found his world, as it seemed, on the verge of complete collapse. He\r\nevoked order out of chaos; got rid one after the other of every element\r\nof opposition; established what was practically a new form of government\r\nwithout too violent a breach with the past; breathed fresh meaning into\r\nold names and institutions, and could stand forth as a reformer rather\r\nthan an innovator, while even those who lost most by the change were\r\nsoothed into submission without glaring loss of self-respect. He worked\r\nceaselessly to maintain the order thus established, and nearly every part\r\nof his great empire had reason to be grateful for increased security,\r\nexpanding prosperity, and added amenity of life. Nor can it be said\r\nthat he reaped the credit due in truth to ministers. He had excellent\r\nministers and agents, with abilities in this or that direction superior\r\nto his own; but none who could take his place as a whole. He was the\r\ncentre from which their activities radiated: he was the inspirer, the\r\ncareful organiser, the unwearied manipulator of details, to whom all\r\nlooked, and seldom in vain, for support and guidance. We may add this to\r\na dignity never forgotten, enhanced by a physical beauty and grace which\r\nhelped to secure reverence for his person and office, and established\r\na sentiment which the unworthiness of some of his successors could not\r\nwholly destroy. He and not Iulius was the founder of the Empire, and it\r\nwas to him that succeeding emperors looked back as the origin of their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nYet his achievements have interested men less than the conquest of\r\nGaul and the victories in the civil war won by the marvellous rapidity\r\nand splendid boldness of Iulius. Consequently modern estimates of the\r\ncharacter and aims of Augustus have been comparatively few. An exhaustive\r\ntreatise is now appearing in Germany by V. Gardthausen, which will\r\nbe a most complete storehouse of facts. Without any pretence to such\r\nelaboration of detail, I have tried in these pages to do something to\r\ncorrect the balance, and to give a picture of the man as I have formed\r\nit in my own mind. The only modest merit which I would claim for my\r\nbook is that it is founded on a study as complete as I could make it of\r\nthe ancient authorities and sources of information without conscious\r\nimitation of any modern writer. These authorities are better for the\r\nearlier period to about B.C. 24, while they had the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s own Memoirs\r\non which to rely. The multiform activities of his later life are chiefly\r\nto be gathered from inscriptions and monuments, which record the care\r\nwhich neglected no part however remote of the Empire. In these later\r\nyears such histories as we have are more concerned with wars and military\r\nmovements than with administration. Suetonius is full of good things,\r\nbut is without chronological or systematic order, and is wanting in\r\nthe critical spirit to discriminate between irresponsible rumours and\r\nhistorical facts. Dio Cassius, plain and honest always, grows less and\r\nless full as the reign goes on. Velleius, who might at least have given\r\nus full details of the later German wars, is seldom definite or precise,\r\nand is tiresome from devotion to a single hero in Tiberius, and by an\r\nirritating style.\r\n\r\nIt has been my object to illustrate the policy of Augustus by constant\r\nreference to the Court view as represented by the poets. But in his\r\nlater years Ovid is a poor substitute for Horace in this point of view.\r\nThe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s own catalogue of his achievements, preserved on the walls\r\nof the temple at Ancyra, is the best possible summary; but a summary\r\nit is after all, and requires to be made to live by careful study and\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional history of the reign is that which has generally\r\nengaged most attention. I have striven to state the facts clearly. Of\r\ntheir exact significance opinions will differ. I have given my own for\r\nwhat it is worth, and can only say that it has been formed independently\r\nby study of our authorities.\r\n\r\nI have not tried to represent my hero as faultless or to make black\r\nwhite. Nothing can clear Augustus of the charge of cruelty up to B.C.\r\n31. But in judging him regard must be had to his age and circumstances.\r\nWe must not, at any rate, allow our judgment of his later statesmanship\r\nto be controlled by the memory of his conduct in a time of civil war\r\nand confusion. He succeeded in re-constituting a society shaken to its\r\ncentre. We must acknowledge that and accept the bad with the good. But it\r\nis false criticism to deny or blink the one from admiration of the other.\r\n\r\nI have to thank the authorities of the British Museum for casts of coins\r\nreproduced in this book: also the Syndics of the Pitt Press, Cambridge,\r\nfor the loan of certain other casts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n    PREFACE                                                              v\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH, B.C. 63-44                                      1\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    THE ROMAN EMPIRE AT THE DEATH OF IULIUS C\xc3\x86SAR                       17\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    THE INHERITANCE                                                     34\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    THE CONSULSHIP AND TRIUMVIRATE                                      53\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    PHILIPPI                                                            79\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    PERUSIA AND SICILY                                                  89\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    ACTIUM                                                             109\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    THE NEW CONSTITUTION, B.C. 30-23                                   131\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    THE FIRST PRINCIPATUS, B.C. 27-23                                  151\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    THE IMPERIAL AND MILITARY POLICY OF AUGUSTUS                       171\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    AUGUSTUS AND HIS WORSHIPPERS                                       194\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    THE REFORMER AND LEGISLATOR                                        212\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    LATER LIFE AND FAMILY TROUBLES                                     233\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n    THE LAST DAYS                                                      247\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n    THE EMPEROR AUGUSTUS, HIS CHARACTER AND AIMS, HIS WORK AND\r\n      FRIENDS                                                          265\r\n\r\n    AUGUSTUS\xe2\x80\x99S ACCOUNT OF HIS REIGN                                    293\r\n      (_From the Inscription in the Temple of Rome and Augustus\r\n      at Angora_)\r\n\r\n    INDEX                                                              303\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Illustrations\r\n\r\n\r\n    AUGUSTUS WITH _CORONA CIVICA_.

Two branches of the Octavii were descended\r\nfrom C. Octavius Rufus, qu\xc3\xa6stor in B.C. 230. The elder branch had\r\nproduced five consuls and other Roman magistrates, but of the younger\r\nbranch Gaius Octavius, the father of Augustus, was the first to hold\r\ncurule office. According to the inscription, afterwards placed by his\r\nson in the _sacrarium_ of the palace,[2] he had twice served as military\r\ntribune, had been qu\xc3\xa6stor, plebeian \xc3\xa6dile, iudex qu\xc3\xa6stionum, and pr\xc3\xa6tor.\r\nAfter the pr\xc3\xa6torship (B.C. 61) he governed Macedonia with conspicuous\r\nability and justice. He is quoted by Cicero as a model administrator\r\nof a province; and he was sufficiently successful against the Bessi\r\nand other Thracian tribes\xe2\x80\x94constant scourges of Macedonia\xe2\x80\x94to be hailed\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cimperator\xe2\x80\x9d by his soldiers. He returned to Italy late in B.C. 59,\r\nintending next year to be a candidate for the consulship, but early in\r\nB.C. 58 he died suddenly in his villa at Nola, in the same chamber as\r\nthat in which his son, seventy-two years later, breathed his last.[3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mother of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nThe mother of the young Gaius Octavius was Atia, daughter of M. Atius\r\nBalbus,[4] of Velitr\xc3\xa6, and Iulia, sister of Gaius Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar. This\r\nconnection with C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x94already rising in political importance\xe2\x80\x94may have\r\nmade his birth of some social interest, but the ominous circumstances\r\nsaid to have accompanied it are doubtless due to the curiosity or\r\ncredulity of the next generation. The people of Velitr\xc3\xa6, it is reported,\r\nhad been told by an oracle that a master of the Empire was to be born\r\nthere. Rumours, it is said, were current in Rome shortly before his\r\nbirth that a \xe2\x80\x9cking of the Roman people\xe2\x80\x9d was about to be born. His mother\r\ndreamed strange dreams, and the learned Publius Nigidius prophesied the\r\nbirth of a lord of the world; while Catullus and Cicero had visions.[5]\r\nBut there was, in fact, nothing mysterious or unusual in his infancy,\r\nwhich was passed with his foster-nurse at Velitr\xc3\xa6. When he was two years\r\nold his father, on his way to his province, carried out successfully an\r\norder of the Senate to destroy a band of brigands near Thurii, survivors,\r\nit is said, of the followers of Spartacus and Catiline. In memory of this\r\nsuccess his parents gave the boy the cognomen Thurinus. He never seems\r\nto have used the name, though Suetonius says that he once possessed a\r\nbust of the child with this name inscribed on it in letters that had\r\nbecome almost illegible. He presented it to Hadrian, who placed it in his\r\nprivate _sacrarium_.[6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stepfather of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great-uncle of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Triumvirate and its results.]\r\n\r\nAbout B.C. 57 or 56[7] his mother Atia re-married. Her husband was L.\r\nMarcius Philippus (pr\xc3\xa6tor B.C. 60, governor of Syria B.C. 59-7, Consul\r\nB.C. 56); and when in his ninth year Octavius lost his foster-mother he\r\nbecame a regular member of his stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s household. Philippus was\r\nnot a man of much force, but he belonged to the highest society, and\r\nthough opposed to C\xc3\xa6sar in politics, appears to have managed to keep\r\non good terms with him.[8] But during his great-nephew\xe2\x80\x99s boyhood C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nwas little at Rome. Pr\xc3\xa6tor in B.C. 62, he had gone the following year\r\nto Spain. He returned in B.C. 60 to stand for the consulship, and soon\r\nafter the consulship, early in B.C. 58, he started for Gaul, from which\r\nhe did not return to Rome till he came in arms in B.C. 49. But though\r\noccupied during the summers in his famous campaigns beyond the Alps, he\r\nspent most of his winters in Northern Italy\xe2\x80\x94at Ravenna or Lucca\xe2\x80\x94where he\r\nreceived his partisans and was kept in touch with home politics, and was\r\nprobably visited by his relatives. Just before entering on his consulship\r\nhe had formed with Pompey and Crassus the agreement for mutual support\r\nknown as the First Triumvirate. The series of events which broke up this\r\ncombination and made civil war inevitable must have been well known to\r\nthe boy. He must have been aware that the laurelled despatches of his\r\ngreat-uncle announcing victory after victory were viewed with secret\r\nalarm by many of the nobles who visited Philippus; and that these men\r\nwere seeking to secure in Pompey a leader capable of outshining C\xc3\xa6sar in\r\nthe popular imagination by victories and triumphs of his own. He was old\r\nenough to understand the meaning of the riots of the rival law-breakers,\r\nMilo and Clodius, which drenched Rome in blood. Election after election\r\nwas interrupted, and, finally, after the murder of Clodius (January,\r\nB.C. 52), all eyes were fixed on Pompey as the sole hope of peace and\r\norder. There was much talk of naming him dictator, but finally he was\r\ncreated sole consul (apparently by a decree of the Senate) and remained\r\nsole consul till August, when he held an election and returned his\r\nfather-in-law, Metellus Scipio, as his colleague.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s position after B.C. 52.]\r\n\r\nThe upshot of these disorders, therefore, was to give Pompey a very\r\nstrong position. He was, in fact, dictator (_seditionis sedand\xc3\xa6 causa_)\r\nunder another name; and the Optimates hastened to secure him as their\r\nchampion. A law had been passed in B.C. 56, by agreement with C\xc3\xa6sar,\r\ngiving Pompey the whole of Spain as a province for five years after his\r\nconsulship of B.C. 55. As C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s government of Gaul terminated at the\r\nend of B.C. 49, Pompey would have imperium and an army when C\xc3\xa6sar left\r\nhis province. He would naturally indeed be in Spain; but the Senate now\r\npassed a resolution that it was for the good of the State that Pompey\r\nshould remain near Rome. He accordingly governed Spain by three legati,\r\nand remained outside the walls of the city with imperium. The great\r\nobject of the Optimates was that C\xc3\xa6sar should return to Rome a _privatus_\r\nwhile Pompey was still there in this unprecedented position. C\xc3\xa6sar wished\r\nto be consul for B.C. 48. The Optimates did not openly oppose that wish,\r\nbut contended that he should lay down his provincial government and\r\nmilitary command first, and come to Rome to make his _professio_, or\r\nformal announcement of his being a candidate, in the usual way.[9]\r\n\r\nBut C\xc3\xa6sar declined to walk into this trap. He knew that if he came home\r\nas a _privatus_ there were many ready to prosecute him for his actions\r\nin Gaul, and with Pompey there in command of legions he felt certain\r\nthat a verdict inflicting political ruin on him could be obtained. He\r\ntherefore stood by the right\xe2\x80\x94secured by a law of B.C. 55, and reinforced\r\nby Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s own law in B.C. 52\xe2\x80\x94of standing for the consulship without\r\ncoming to Rome, and without giving up his province and army before the\r\ntime originally fixed by the law. He would thus not be without imperium\r\nfor a single day, but would come to Rome as consul.\r\n\r\nHere was a direct issue. Pompey professed to believe that it could be\r\nsettled by a decree of the Senate, either forbidding the holder of the\r\nelection to receive votes for C\xc3\xa6sar in his absence, or appointing a\r\nsuccessor in his province. C\xc3\xa6sar, he argued, would of course obey a\r\n_Senatus-consultum_. But C\xc3\xa6sar was on firm ground in refusing to admit\r\na successor till the term fixed by the law had expired, and also in\r\nclaiming that his candidature should be admitted in his absence\xe2\x80\x94for that\r\ntoo had been granted by a law. If neither side would yield the only\r\npossible solution was war.[10]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provocation to C\xc3\xa6sar.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar hesitated for some time. He saw no hope of mollifying his enemies\r\nor separating Pompey from them. His daughter Iulia\xe2\x80\x99s death in B.C. 54\r\nafter a few years\xe2\x80\x99 marriage to Pompey had severed a strong tie between\r\nthem. The death of Crassus in B.C. 53 had removed, not indeed a man of\r\nmuch strength of character, but one whose enormous wealth had given him\r\nsuch a hold on the senators that any strong act on their part, against\r\nhis wishes, was difficult. After his death the actual provocations to\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar had certainly increased. The depriving him, under the pretext of\r\nan impending Parthian war, of two legions which were being kept under\r\narms in Italy; the insult inflicted upon him by Marcellus (Consul B.C.\r\n51) in flogging a magistrate of his new colony at Comum, who if the\r\ncolony were regarded as legally established would be exempt from such\r\npunishment;\xe2\x80\x94these and similar things shewed C\xc3\xa6sar what he had to expect\r\nif he gave up office and army. He elected therefore to stand on his legal\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war.]\r\n\r\nLegality was on his side, but long prescription was in favour of the\r\nSenate\xe2\x80\x99s claim to the obedience of a magistrate, especially of the\r\ngovernor of a province. There was therefore a deadlock. C\xc3\xa6sar made one\r\nattempt\xe2\x80\x94not perhaps a very sincere one\xe2\x80\x94to remove it. He had won over\r\nGaius Curio, tribune in B.C. 50, by helping him to discharge his immense\r\ndebts. Curio therefore, instead of opposing C\xc3\xa6sar, as had been expected,\r\nvetoed every proposal for his recall. His tribuneship ended on the 9th of\r\nDecember, B.C. 50, and he immediately started to visit C\xc3\xa6sar at Ravenna.\r\nHe told him of the inveteracy of his opponents, and urged him to march\r\nat once upon Rome. But C\xc3\xa6sar determined to justify himself by offering a\r\npeaceful solution\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che was willing to hand over his province and army to\r\na successor, if Pompey would also give up Spain and dismiss his armies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCurio returned to Rome in time for the meeting of the Senate on the 1st\r\nof January, B.C. 49, bringing this despatch from C\xc3\xa6sar.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Senate affected to regard it as an act of rebellion.\r\nAfter a debate, lasting five days, a decree was passed on January\r\nthe 7th, ordering C\xc3\xa6sar to give up his province and army on a fixed\r\nday, on pain of being declared guilty of treason. This was vetoed by\r\ntwo tribunes, M. Antonius and Q. Cassius. Refusing, after the usual\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cremonstrance,\xe2\x80\x9d to withdraw their veto, they were finally expelled and\r\nfled to Ariminum, on their way to join C\xc3\xa6sar at Ravenna. The Senate\r\nthen passed the _Senatus-consultum ultimum_, ordering the magistrates\r\nand pro-magistrates \xe2\x80\x9cto see that the state took no harm,\xe2\x80\x9d and a levy of\r\nsoldiers\xe2\x80\x94already begun by Pompey\xe2\x80\x94was ordered to be held in all parts of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: C\xc3\xa6sar crosses the Rubicon.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, informed of this, addressed the single legion which was with him\r\nat Ravenna, urging it to support the violated tribunes. Satisfied with\r\nthe response to his appeal, he took the final step of passing the Rubicon\r\nand marching to Ariminum, outside his province.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were now in the wrong, the Senate by forcibly interfering\r\nwith the action of the tribunes, C\xc3\xa6sar by entering Italy. An attempt,\r\ntherefore, was made to effect a compromise. Lucius C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x94a distant\r\nconnection of Iulius\xe2\x80\x94visited him at Ariminum, bringing some general\r\nprofessions of moderation from Pompey, though it seems without any\r\ndefinite suggestion. C\xc3\xa6sar, however, so far modified his former offer\r\nas to propose a conference, with the understanding that the levy of\r\ntroops in Italy was to be stopped and Pompey was to go to his Spanish\r\nprovince. On receiving this communication at Capua Pompey and the consuls\r\ndeclined all terms until C\xc3\xa6sar had withdrawn from Ariminum into Gaul;\r\nthough they intimated, without mentioning any date, that Pompey would\r\nin that case go to Spain. But the levy of troops was not interrupted;\r\nand C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this was the triumphant march through Picenum and\r\nto Brundisium. Town after town surrendered, and the garrisons placed in\r\nthem by Pompey generally joined the advancing army, till finally a large\r\nforce, embracing many men of high rank, surrendered at Corfinium. C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nhad entered Italy with only one legion, but others were summoned from\r\nwinter quarters in Cisalpine Gaul, and by the time he reached Brundisium\r\nPompey had given up all idea of resisting him in Italy, and within\r\nthe walls of that town was preparing to cross to Epirus, whither the\r\nconsuls with the main body of his troops had already gone. C\xc3\xa6sar had no\r\nships with which to follow him. He was content to hasten his flight by\r\nthreatening to block up the harbour. Pompey safely out of Italy, he went\r\nto Rome to arrange for his regular election into the consulship. Meeting\r\nwith opposition there[11]\xe2\x80\x94one of the tribunes, L. C\xc3\xa6cilius Metellus,\r\nvetoing all proposals in the Senate\xe2\x80\x94he hastened to Spain to attack the\r\nlegates of Pompey, stopping on his way to arrange the siege of Marseilles\r\n(which had admitted Ahenobarbus, named successor of C\xc3\xa6sar in Gaul),\r\nand sending legati to secure Sicily, Sardinia, and Africa. Of these the\r\nonly failure was in Africa, where Curio was defeated and killed. This\r\nprovince therefore remained in the hands of the Pompeians; but C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown successes in Spain, the fall of Marseilles, and the hold gained upon\r\nthe corn supplies of Sicily and Sardinia placed him in a strong position.\r\nThe constitutional difficulty was surmounted; he was named Dictator to\r\nhold the elections, returned himself as consul, and, after eleven days in\r\nRome for the Latin games, embarked at Brundisium on January 3, B.C. 48,\r\nto attack Pompey in Epirus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar master of the Roman world, B.C. 47.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow the events of the next six months. C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nhad to struggle with great difficulties, for Pompey as master of the\r\nsea had a secure base of supplies; and therefore, though C\xc3\xa6sar drew\r\nvast lines round his camp, he could not starve him out. Pompey, in\r\nfact, actually pierced C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s lines and defeated him in more than one\r\nengagement. Eventually, however, C\xc3\xa6sar drew him into Thessaly; and the\r\ngreat victory of Pharsalia (August 9th) made up for everything. Pompey\r\nfled to Egypt, to meet his death on the beach by order of the treacherous\r\nyoung king; and though C\xc3\xa6sar still had weary work to do before Egypt\r\nwas reduced to obedience, and then had to traverse Asia Minor to crush\r\nPharnaces of Pontus at Zela, when he set foot once more in Italy in\r\nSeptember, B.C. 47, he had already been created Dictator, and was\r\npractically master of the Roman world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius takes the _toga virilis_ and is made a pontifex, B.C.\r\n48.]\r\n\r\nIn these momentous events the young Octavius had taken no part. At the\r\nbeginning of B.C. 49 he had been sent away to one of his ancestral\r\nestates in the country. But we cannot suppose him incapable of\r\nunderstanding their importance or being an uninterested spectator. His\r\nstepfather Philippus was Pompeian in sympathy, but his close connection\r\nwith C\xc3\xa6sar kept him from taking an active part in the war, and he was\r\nallowed to remain in Italy, probably for the most part in his Campanian\r\nvilla. From time to time, however, he came to Rome; and Octavius, who now\r\nlived entirely with him, began to be treated with a distinction natural\r\nto the near relative of the victorious dictator. Soon after the news of\r\nPharsalia he took the _toga virilis_, and about the same time was elected\r\ninto the college of pontifices in the place of L. Domitius Ahenobarbus,\r\nwho had fallen in the battle. This was an office desired by the highest\r\nin the land, and the election of so young a boy, just entering upon his\r\nsixteenth year, put him in a position something like that of a prince of\r\nthe blood; just as afterwards Augustus caused his two grandsons to be\r\ndesignated to the consulship, and declared capable of official employment\r\nas soon as they had taken the _toga virilis_.[12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius\xe2\x80\x99s relations with his parents and his great-uncle.]\r\n\r\nThe boy, who three years before had made a great impression by his\r\ndelivery of the _laudatio_ at his grandmother Iulia\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, again\r\nattracted much attention by his good looks and modesty. He became the\r\nfashion; and when (as was customary for the pontifices) he presided\r\nin a pr\xc3\xa6torian court during the _feri\xc3\xa6 Latin\xc3\xa6_, it was observed to be\r\nmore crowded by suitors and their friends than any of the others. It\r\nseems that the rarity of his appearance at Rome added to the interest\r\nroused by his great-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s successes. For his mother did not relax\r\nher watchfulness. Though legally a man he was still carefully guarded.\r\nHe was required to sleep in the same simple chamber, to visit the same\r\nhouses, and to follow the same way of life as before. Even his religious\r\nduties were performed before daylight, to escape the languishing looks of\r\nintriguing beauties. These precautions were seconded by his own cool and\r\ncautious temperament, and the result seems to have been that he passed\r\nthrough the dangerous stage of adolescence\xe2\x80\x94doubly dangerous to one now\r\npractically a prince\xe2\x80\x94uncontaminated by the grosser vices of Rome. Stories\r\nto the contrary, afterwards spread abroad by his enemies, are of the most\r\nunsubstantial and untrustworthy kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YOUNG OCTAVIUS.\r\n\r\n_Photographed from the Bust in the Vatican by Edne. Alinari._\r\n\r\n_To face page 10._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wishes to go to Africa with C\xc3\xa6sar.]\r\n\r\nBut though he seems to have quietly submitted to this tutelage, he soon\r\nconceived an ardent desire to share in the activities of his great-uncle.\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar had been very little at Rome since the beginning of the civil war.\r\nA few days in March, B.C. 49, thirteen days in December of the same\r\nyear, were all that he had spent in the city. He was absent during the\r\nwhole of his consulship (B.C. 48) till September, B.C. 47. On his return\r\nfrom Alexandria in that month, he stayed barely three months at Rome. On\r\nthe 19th of December he was at Lilyb\xc3\xa6um, on his way to Africa to attack\r\nthe surviving Pompeians. Octavius longed to go with him, and C\xc3\xa6sar was\r\nwilling to take him. But his health was not good, and his mother set\r\nherself against it. The Dictator might no doubt have insisted, but he saw\r\nthat the boy was not fit to face the fatigues of a campaign. Octavius\r\nsubmitted, quietly biding his time. He was rewarded by finding himself\r\nhigh in his great-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s favour when he returned in B.C. 46 after\r\nthe victory of Thapsus. He was admitted to share his triple triumph,\r\nriding in a chariot immediately behind that of the imperator, dressed\r\nin military uniform as though he had actually been engaged. He found,\r\nmoreover, that he had sufficient interest with C\xc3\xa6sar to obtain pardon for\r\nthe brother of his friend Agrippa, taken prisoner in the Pompeian army in\r\nAfrica. This first use of his influence made a good impression, without\r\nweakening his great-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s affection for him. Though C\xc3\xa6sar did not\r\nformally adopt him,[13] he treated him openly as his nearest relation\r\nand heir. Octavius rode near him in his triumph, stood by his side at the\r\nsacrifice, took precedence of all the staff or court that surrounded him,\r\nand accompanied him to theatres and banquets. He was soon besieged by\r\npetitions to be laid before C\xc3\xa6sar, and shewed both tact and good nature\r\nin dealing with them. This close connection with the wise and magnanimous\r\nDictator, inspired him with warm admiration and affection, which help\r\nto explain and excuse the severity with which he afterwards pursued his\r\nmurderers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius employed in civil duties, B.C. 46.]\r\n\r\nIn order to give him experience of civic duties, one of the theatres was\r\nnow put under his charge. But his assiduous attention to this duty in\r\nthe hot season brought on a dangerous illness, one of the many which he\r\nencountered during his long life. There was a general feeling of regret\r\nat the prospect of a career of such promise being cut short. C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nvisited him daily or sent friends to him, insisted on the physicians\r\nremaining constantly at his side, and being informed while at dinner\r\nthat the boy had fainted and was in imminent danger, he sprang up from\r\nhis couch, and without waiting to change his dining slippers, hurried to\r\nhis chamber, besought the physicians in moving terms to do their utmost,\r\nand sitting down by the bed shewed the liveliest joy when the patient\r\nrecovered from his swoon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius follows C\xc3\xa6sar to Spain, B.C. 45.]\r\n\r\nOctavius was too weak to accompany the Dictator when starting for\r\nSpain against Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s sons in December B.C. 46. But as soon as he was\r\nsufficiently recovered he determined to follow him. He refused all\r\ncompany except that of a few select friends and the most active of his\r\nslaves. He would not admit his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wish to go with him. He had\r\nyielded to her before, but he was now resolved to take part in a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork alone. His voyage, early in B.C. 45, proved long and dangerous;\r\nand when at length he landed at Tarraco he found his uncle already at\r\nthe extreme south of Spain, somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar. The\r\nroads were rendered dangerous by scattered parties of hostile natives, or\r\noutposts of the enemy, and his escort was small. Still, he pushed on with\r\nenergy and reached C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s quarters near Calpe, to which he had advanced\r\nafter the victory at Munda (March 17th). Gn\xc3\xa6us Pompeius had fled on board\r\na ship, but was killed when landing for water on the 11th of April, and\r\nit was apparently just about that time that Octavius reached the camp.\r\nWarmly received and highly praised for his energy by the Dictator, he\r\nwas at once admitted to his table and close intimacy, during which C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nlearned still more to appreciate the quickness of his intelligence and\r\nthe careful control which he kept over his tongue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius accompanies his great-uncle to Carthage.]\r\n\r\nAffairs in Southern Spain having been apparently settled (though as it\r\nproved the danger was by no means over), Octavius accompanied C\xc3\xa6sar to\r\nCarthage, to settle questions which had arisen as to the assignment of\r\nland in his new colony. The Dictator was visited there by deputations\r\nfrom various Greek states, alleging grievances or asking favours.\r\nOctavius was applied to by more than one of them to plead their cause,\r\nand had therefore again an opportunity of acquiring practical experience\r\nin the business of imperial government, and in the very best school.\r\n\r\nHe preceded C\xc3\xa6sar on his return to Rome, and on his arrival had once more\r\noccasion to shew his caution and prudence. Among those who met him in the\r\nusual complimentary procession was a young man who had somehow managed to\r\nmake himself a popular hero by pretending to be a grandson of the great\r\nMarius. His real name was Amatius or Herophilus, a veterinary surgeon\r\naccording to some, but certainly of humble origin. As Marius had married\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s aunt Iulia, this man was anxious to be recognised as a cousin by\r\nthe Dictator. He had in vain applied to Cicero to undertake his cause,\r\nand to Atia and her half-sister to recognise him. The difficulty for\r\nOctavius was that the man was a favourite of the populace, of whose cause\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was the professed champion; yet his recognition would be offensive\r\nto the nobles and a mere concession to clamour. Octavius avoided the\r\nsnare by referring the case to C\xc3\xa6sar as head of the state and family, and\r\nrefusing to receive the would-be Marius till he had decided.[14]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius at Apollonia, B.C. 45-44.]\r\n\r\nHe did not remain long at Rome however. C\xc3\xa6sar returned in September,\r\nand was assassinated in the following March. And during that interval,\r\nthough he found time for many schemes of legislation, and of restoration\r\nor improvement in the city, he was much employed in preparing for two\r\nexpeditions\xe2\x80\x94calculated to last three years\xe2\x80\x94first against the Daci or Get\xc3\xa6\r\non the Danube, and secondly against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. These\r\nwere the two points of active danger in the Empire, and C\xc3\xa6sar desired\r\nto crown his public services by securing their peace and safety. For\r\nthis purpose six legions were quartered in Macedonia for the winter, in\r\nreadiness to march along the Via Egnatia to the eastern coast of Greece.\r\nReturning from Spain Dictator for life, C\xc3\xa6sar was to have two \xe2\x80\x9cMasters\r\nof the Horse.\xe2\x80\x9d One was to be Octavius, who had meanwhile been created\r\na patrician by the Senate.[15] But for the present he was sent to pass\r\nthe winter at Apollonia, the Greek colony at the beginning of the Via\r\nEgnatia, where he might continue his studies in quiet with the rhetors\r\nand other teachers whom he took with him or found there,[16] and at the\r\nsame time might get some military training with the legions that were\r\nnot far off. He was accompanied by some of the young men with whom he\r\nhabitually associated. Among them were Agrippa and M\xc3\xa6cenas, who remained\r\nhis friends and ministers to the end of their lives, and Salvidienus\r\nRufus, who almost alone of his early friends proved unfaithful.[17]\r\n\r\nHe seems to have led a quiet life at Apollonia, winning golden opinions\r\nin the town and from his teachers for his studious and regular habits.\r\nThe admiration and loyalty of his friends were confirmed; and many of the\r\nofficers of the legions seem to have made up their minds to regard him as\r\nthe best possible successor to the Dictator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: News of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s assassination brought to Apollonia.]\r\n\r\nIn the sixth month of his residence at Apollonia, in the afternoon of\r\na March day, a freedman of his mother arrived with every sign of rapid\r\ntravel and agitation. He delivered a letter from Atia, dated the 15th of\r\nMarch. It briefly stated that the Dictator had just been assassinated\r\nin the Senate House. She added that she \xe2\x80\x9cdid not know what would happen\r\nnext; but it was time now for him to play the man, and to think and act\r\nfor the best at this terrible crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d[18] The bearer of the letter could\r\ntell him nothing else, for he had been despatched immediately after\r\nthe murder, and had loitered nowhere on the way; only he felt sure that\r\nas the conspirators were numerous and powerful, all the kinsfolk of the\r\nDictator would be in danger.\r\n\r\nThis was the last day of Octavius\xe2\x80\x99s youth. From that hour he had to play\r\na dangerous game with desperate players. He did not yet know that by\r\nthe Dictator\xe2\x80\x99s will he had been adopted as his son, and was heir to the\r\ngreater part of his vast wealth; but a passionate desire to avenge him\r\nsprang up in his breast, a desire strengthened with increasing knowledge,\r\nand of which he never lost sight in all the political complications of\r\nthe next ten years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Obv.: M.

Such were the provinces of the Rhine,\r\nthe Alps, and the Danube as far east as M\xc5\x93sia; and to a certain extent\r\nthe province of Galatia and Lycaonia (B.C. 25). The Rhine, the Danube,\r\nand the Euphrates seemed already the natural boundaries of the Empire\r\non the north and east, the Atlantic Ocean on the west, and the African\r\nand Arabian deserts on the south. And these boundaries, with occasional\r\nmodifications, and for the most part temporary extensions, continued to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its dangers.]\r\n\r\nBut though the greater part of this wide Empire was already won, it was\r\nnot all equally well organised and secured. Thus, in Northern Gaul,\r\nthere were still Germans and other enemies to be conquered or repelled;\r\nin Southern Spain a son of the great Pompey was in arms; Macedonia was\r\ncontinually subject to invasion by Get\xc3\xa6, Bessi, and other barbarians; the\r\nDalmatians and neighbouring tribes made Illyricum an uncertain member of\r\nthe Empire; in Syria, C\xc3\xa6cilius Bassus\xe2\x80\x94an old officer of Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94was\r\ndefying Roman armies, and inviting the aid of the Parthians always ready\r\nto cross the Euphrates into the Roman province.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s precautions and preparations.]\r\n\r\nTo confront two of these dangers C\xc3\xa6sar had collected a large army in\r\nMacedonia in the autumn of B.C. 45 to crush the Get\xc3\xa6, and then crossing\r\nto Syria to force the Parthian to respect the frontier of the Euphrates,\r\nor even to attack them in Mesopotamia. The former of these projects\r\nwas no doubt important for the safety of the Empire, and was in after\r\nyears successfully secured by Augustus and his legates. The latter was\r\nmore visionary and theatrical, meant perhaps to strike the imagination\r\nof the Romans rather than to secure great practical advantage. After\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death Antony lost more than he gained by similar enterprises, and\r\nAugustus always avoided coming into actual contact with the Parthians,\r\nor attempting to extend his rule beyond the Euphrates. But there were\r\ndangers within the Empire no less formidable than from without. Its\r\nintegrity had rested, and generally securely rested, on the loyalty\r\nof its provincial governors to the central authority as represented\r\nby the Senate, or, in the last resort, by the order of the people\r\nexpressed in a _lex_ or _plebiscitum_. It was the beginning of the\r\nend when these governors used the forces under their command, or the\r\nwealth and influence secured abroad, to defy or coerce the authorities\r\nat home. Sertorius, Sulla, and C\xc3\xa6sar himself, had shewn that this was\r\nnot an impossible contingency. It was against this danger that, among\r\nother reforms in the government of the Provinces, C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s own law had\r\nprovided that the tenure of a propr\xc3\xa6tor should be confined to one, and\r\nof a proconsul to two years. But now that he was going on a distant\r\nexpedition, calculated as likely to occupy three years, he took other\r\nprecautions. Having provided for the chief offices at home,[19] he was\r\ncareful to see that the provinces should be held by men whom he believed\r\nto be loyal to himself, and likely from their character and ability to\r\nmaintain their peace and security. Being Consul and Dictator, and his\r\n_acta_ being confirmed beforehand by Senate and people, he could make\r\nwhat nominations he pleased. A decree of the Senate was still taken\r\nas a matter of form, but the old practice (often a farce) of drawing\r\nlots for the provinces was abandoned;[20] Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s law ordaining a five\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 interval between curule office and a province was neglected, and\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar practically nominated the governors. But it raises a doubt as to\r\nthe unfettered power or the insight of the Dictator that five of those\r\nthus nominated were among the assassins on the Ides of March.[21] Nor\r\nin other respects did his choice prove happy. The state of open war or\r\ndangerous unrest which shewed itself in almost all parts of the Empire\r\nafter his death must be learnt by a review of the provinces, if we are to\r\nunderstand the problem presented to Augustus and his colleagues in the\r\ntriumvirate, and the relief felt by the Roman world when Augustus finally\r\ntook the administration into his own hands, and shewed himself capable of\r\nrestoring law and order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (1) THE GAULS.]\r\n\r\nThe GAULS now included three districts, the status of which was somewhat\r\nunsettled. (1) _Cisalpine Gaul_, that is, Italy between Etruria and the\r\nAlps, was still nominally a province, though C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s law of B.C. 48\r\nhad granted full _civitas_ to the transpadane, as that of B.C. 89 had\r\nto the cispadane, towns. It had formed part of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s province from\r\nB.C. 58 to B.C. 48, and he seems to have retained it until after the\r\nbattle of Pharsalia, when he appointed first Marcus Brutus and then C.\r\nVibius Pansa to it. Though part of Italy, and generally peaceful, it had\r\ngreat military importance in case of an invasion from the north. After\r\nMarch B.C. 44 it was to be in the hands of Decimus Brutus, who had long\r\nserved under C\xc3\xa6sar, and was regarded by him with special confidence and\r\naffection. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to wrest it from Decimus Brutus brought on\r\nthe first civil war after C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (2) TRANSALPINE GAUL.]\r\n\r\n(2) _Transalpine Gaul_ technically consisted of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Province,\xe2\x80\x9d that is,\r\nSouth-eastern France, from the Cevennes on the west to Italy, and from\r\nthe Lake of Geneva on the north to the sea. But since C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s conquests\r\nthere had to be added to this the rest of France, Belgium, and Holland\r\nas far as the Rhine. No formal division into distinct provinces had yet\r\nbeen made. In B.C. 49 Decimus Brutus, after driving out Ahenobarbus,\r\nthe governor named by the Senate, remained in command of the whole\r\ntill B.C. 45, when he returned in C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s train to Italy. But in the\r\ncourse of these four years, or on his return, (3) Belgica was separated\r\nfrom the rest and assigned to Hirtius, who, however, governed it by a\r\nlegate named Aurelius, without going there himself.[22] In the course of\r\nthe next year a farther division was made: Aurelius retained Belgica;\r\nLepidus, with four legions, was appointed to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Province\xe2\x80\x9d (afterwards\r\ncalled Gallia Narbonensis) together with Hispania Citerior; while L.\r\nMunatius Plancus governed the rest, consisting of what was afterwards\r\ntwo provinces\xe2\x80\x94Aquitania and Lugdunensis. Plancus and Decimus Brutus were\r\nnamed consuls for B.C. 42, and therefore their governorships necessarily\r\nterminated at the end of B.C. 43, and might do so earlier. In the course\r\nof B.C. 43 Plancus founded Lugdunum[23] (Lyon), which was afterwards\r\nthe capital of the central province of the four organised by Augustus.\r\nBut though the organisation of this country was not complete, C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconquest had been so decisive that no advantage was taken of the civil\r\nwar by the natives to attempt a rising.[24] There seem to have been some\r\ninsignificant movements in B.C. 42, but it was not for some years later\r\nthat any danger of importance arose there. The Belg\xc3\xa6 had been expected\r\nto rise on C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s assassination, but their chiefs hastened to assure\r\nHirtius\xe2\x80\x99s legate of their adhesion to the Roman government.[25]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (3) ILLYRICUM.]\r\n\r\nThe province of ILLYRICUM had been formed about the same time as that\r\nof Macedonia (B.C. 146), but its limits had fluctuated, and it had\r\nnot received much continuous attention. It included places, such as\r\nDyrrachium, Corcyra, Issa, Pharus, which had been declared free after\r\nthe contest with Queen Teuta in B.C. 228, but were practically under\r\nRoman control. Yet some of the most powerful tribes not only did not\r\nacknowledge Roman authority, but made frequent incursions upon Roman\r\nIllyricum. The most dangerous of these were the Dalmatians, with whom\r\nseveral wars are recorded. In B.C. 117 L. C\xc3\xa6lius Metellus occupied\r\nSalon\xc3\xa6;[26] in B.C. 87-5 Sulla won a victory over them;[27] in B.C. 78-77\r\nC. Cosconius, after a two years\xe2\x80\x99 campaign, took Salon\xc3\xa6 by storm.[28] But\r\nlittle was really effected in securing the province against its enemies.\r\nIt was let much alone so long as its tribute was paid, and was put under\r\nthe governor sometimes of Macedonia, sometimes of Cisalpine Gaul. In\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s case (B.C. 58) it was specially assigned, like the rest of his\r\nprovince, and he seems at first to have intended to go there in force\r\nand subdue the hostile barbarians. But the Gallic campaigns drew him\r\naway, and he only once actually entered Illyricum (B.C. 54) to overawe\r\nthe invading Pirust\xc3\xa6. In the last year of his proconsulship (B.C. 50)\r\nsome troops which he sent against the Dalmatians were cut to pieces.\r\nThe result of this was that the barbarians, fearing his vengeance,\r\nadhered to Pompey in the civil war, whose legate, M. Octavius, with a\r\nconsiderable fleet, maintained himself there,[29] and in B.C. 49 defeated\r\nand captured Gaius Antonius, whom C\xc3\xa6sar sent against him.[30] At the\r\nbeginning of the next year Aulus Gabinius, while trying to lead a force\r\nround the head of the Adriatic to join C\xc3\xa6sar, lost nearly all his men\r\nin a battle with the Dalmatians.[31] After Pharsalia Gabinius was sent\r\nback to assist Cornificius, who had been despatched to Illyricum as\r\npropr\xc3\xa6tor after the mishap of Gaius Antonius; but he was again defeated\r\nand shut up in Salon\xc3\xa6, where he died suddenly.[32] In B.C. 47, however,\r\nP. Vatinius, having joined Cornificius, defeated and drove Octavius out\r\nof the country.[33] After serving also in the African campaign of B.C.\r\n46, Vatinius was sent back to Illyricum with three legions (B.C. 45)\r\nexpressly to reduce the still independent tribes. At first he gained\r\nsufficient success to be honoured by a _supplicatio_,[34] but after\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death he was defeated by the Dalmatians with the loss of five\r\ncohorts, and was driven to take refuge in Dyrrachium.[35] Early in B.C.\r\n43 he was forced to surrender his legions to M. Brutus, who, however, in\r\nthe year and a half which preceded his death at Philippi, was too busy\r\nelsewhere to attend to Illyricum.[36] Hence the expeditions of Pollio in\r\nB.C. 39,[37] and of Augustus in B.C. 35 were rendered necessary, and they\r\nfor a time secured the pacification of the country and the extension of\r\nRoman provinces to the Danube.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (4) SPAIN.]\r\n\r\nAt the death of Iulius SPAIN was also a source of great danger\r\nand difficulty. Since B.C. 197 it had been divided into two\r\nprovinces\xe2\x80\x94Citerior and Ulterior\xe2\x80\x94separated by the Saltus Castulonensis\r\n(_Sierra Morena_), each governed by a pr\xc3\xa6tor or propr\xc3\xa6tor. In B.C. 54\r\nPompey introduced a triple division. Of his three legates Afranius held\r\nHispania Citerior; but the farther province was divided between Petreius,\r\nwho held the district as far west as the Anas (_Guadiana_), afterwards\r\ncalled B\xc3\xa6tica, while Terentius Varro governed the country west of that\r\nriver with Lusitania. Having forced Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s legates to surrender the\r\ncountry (B.C. 49), C\xc3\xa6sar seems not to have continued the triple division.\r\nQ. Cassius was sent to Hispania Ulterior, M. Lepidus to Hispania\r\nCiterior. But Cassius offended his own soldiers as well as the natives,\r\nand had to escape by sea, being drowned on his way home. Nor did his\r\nsuccessor Trebonius do much better in B.C. 47; for many of his soldiers\r\ndeserted to Gn\xc3\xa6us Pompeius when he came to Spain after the defeat at\r\nThapsus in the spring of B.C. 46.[38] And though Gn\xc3\xa6us Pompeius perished\r\nsoon after the battle of Munda (B.C. 45) his younger brother Sextus\r\nsurvived. At C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death he was already at the head of a considerable\r\nfleet which enabled him to control Sicily and re-occupy B\xc3\xa6tica, when\r\nits last C\xc3\xa6sarean governor\xe2\x80\x94the famous C. Asinius Pollio\xe2\x80\x94left it to join\r\nAntony in Gallia Narbonensis in the summer of B.C. 43. The upper province\r\nhad meanwhile been governed by the legates of Metellus, who was about to\r\nreturn to it and Gallia Narbonensis with four legions when C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nintroduced new complications.[39]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (5) SICILY.]\r\n\r\nSICILY for eight years after C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death was practically separated from\r\nthe Empire. In B.C. 49 it had been easily won over to C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s authority\r\nby C. Curio, and after his success in Spain against Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s legates\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar had nominated Aulus Allienus[40] as its propr\xc3\xa6tor. In B.C. 46\r\nAllienus was succeeded by M. Acilius[41] (afterwards sent to Achaia), who\r\nin his turn was succeeded by T. Furfanius Postumus (B.C. 45). Finally,\r\namong C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements for B.C. 44 was the appointment of Pompeius\r\nBithynicus to Sicily. His father had served under Pompey and had perished\r\nwith him in Egypt; and Bithynicus seems to have feared retaliation from\r\nthe Pompeians if they returned to power; for on the death of C\xc3\xa6sar we\r\nfind him writing to Cicero in evident anxiety as to his position.[42]\r\nHe failed to hold the island against Sext. Pompeius, who landed in B.C.\r\n43, and after sustaining a slight reverse at Messene forced Bithynicus\r\nto yield him a share in the government, and shortly afterwards put him\r\nto death because he believed him to be plotting against him.[43] Sicily\r\ntherefore had to be restored to the Empire by the triumvirs, a task which\r\nfell chiefly to Augustus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (6) SARDINIA.]\r\n\r\nSARDINIA was important for its supply of corn. In B.C. 49 C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegate Q. Valerius Orca occupied it without difficulty, its governor,\r\nM. Aurelius Cotta, escaping to Africa. In B.C. 48 Orca was succeeded by\r\nSext. Peduc\xc3\xa6us.[44] But the arrangements made between that date and B.C.\r\n44 are not known, for Peduc\xc3\xa6us appears to have been in Rome from the end\r\nof B.C. 45.[45] In the first division of the provinces by the triumvirs\r\n(November, B.C. 43) it fell to Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s share,[46] though Suetonius\r\nremarks that Africa and Sardinia were the only two provinces never\r\nvisited by him.[47] Meanwhile Sext. Pompeius occupied it,[48] and it was\r\nnot recovered till B.C. 38.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (7) AFRICA. NUMIDIA.]\r\n\r\nThe province of AFRICA\xe2\x80\x94the ancient territory of Carthage\xe2\x80\x94may be taken\r\nwith this western part of the Empire. It had long been a peaceful\r\nprovince, but in B.C. 46 it was the scene of the great rally of the\r\nPompeians after the disaster at Pharsalia. Since their final defeat at\r\nThapsus it had been farther secured by C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s colony at Carthage (B.C.\r\n46-5), and had been governed by a fervent C\xc3\xa6sarean, C. Calvisius Sabinus.\r\nAt the end of B.C. 45 Sabinus returned to Rome, and Q. Cornificius (once\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s qu\xc3\xa6stor) was named to succeed him. But affairs in Africa had\r\nbeen complicated by the formation of a new province from the dominions\r\nof Iuba, called sometimes New Africa, sometimes Numidia (B.C. 46).\r\nOf this new province the first propr\xc3\xa6tor was the historian Sallust,\r\nsucceeded in B.C. 45 by T. Sextius with three legions. On C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, therefore, there were two men in Africa who might possibly\r\ntake different views of the situation. Cornificius indeed\xe2\x80\x94friend and\r\ncorrespondent of Cicero\xe2\x80\x94shewed at once that he meant to stand by the\r\nSenate. A few months later he was confirmed in this resolution by the\r\nfact of his continuance in office depending on the senatorial decree\r\nof the 20th of December,[49] whereas Antony had commissioned Calvisius\r\nSabinus (who had never withdrawn his legates from Africa) to go back to\r\nthe province.[50] Accordingly, after Antony\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Mutina (April,\r\nB.C. 43), the Senate felt strong enough to order Sextius to transfer\r\nhis three legions to Cornificius, who was himself under orders to send\r\ntwo of them to Rome.[51] This was done, and with the remaining legion\r\nCornificius maintained his position in Old Africa, when the Triumvirate\r\nwas formed in November, and was able to offer protection to many of the\r\nproscribed. But Sextius now claimed both provinces, as having fallen to\r\nOctavian\xe2\x80\x99s share. He enrolled troops in his own province and obtained the\r\nhelp of Arabion, of the royal family of Numidia and chief of the robber\r\ntribe of Sittians; and though Cornificius had the stronger force, he was\r\npresently defeated and killed. Octavian, however, looked upon Sextius\r\nas a partisan of Antony rather than of himself, and presently sent C.\r\nFuficius Fango to supersede him. Sextius seems to have foreseen that\r\ndifferences would occur between Antony and Octavian likely to give him a\r\nchance of recovering his province. Therefore under pretence of wishing to\r\nwinter in a genial climate he stayed on in Africa. His opportunity came\r\nwith the new distribution of provinces after Philippi (October-November,\r\nB.C. 42). Old or \xe2\x80\x9cPr\xc3\xa6torian\xe2\x80\x9d Africa fell to Antony, New Africa or Numidia\r\nto Octavian. But upon the quarrel between Octavian and Fulvia (supported\r\nby Lucius Antonius) in B.C. 41, Sextius was urged by Fulvia to demand\r\nthe pr\xc3\xa6torian province from Fango as properly belonging to Antony. After\r\nseveral battles, in which he met with various fortunes, Fango was at last\r\ndriven to take refuge in the mountains, and there killed himself. Sextius\r\nthen held both provinces till, in B.C. 40, the triumvir Lepidus took\r\npossession of them as his share of the Empire.[52]\r\n\r\nThus the Western Provinces, in spite of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s precautions, were all in\r\na condition to cause difficulty to his successors in the government. The\r\nEastern Provinces were for the most part in a state of similar disorder.\r\nIllyricum has already been discussed, as most conveniently taken with\r\nthe Gauls. For those farther east C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements were no more\r\nsuccessful in securing peace than in the West.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (8) MACEDONIA.]\r\n\r\nThe victory at Pharsalia put MACEDONIA under C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s control, and he\r\napparently continued to govern it till B.C. 45 by his legates. While in\r\nEgypt (B.C. 48-7), fearing, it seems, that it might be made a centre of\r\nresistance,[53] he directed Gabinius to go there with his legions, if the\r\nstate of Illyricum allowed of it.[54] We have no farther information\r\nas to its government till the autumn of B.C. 45, when a large military\r\nforce was stationed there; and in that, or the following year, Q.\r\nHortensius\xe2\x80\x94son of the famous orator\xe2\x80\x94was made governor. Marcus Brutus was\r\nnamed by C\xc3\xa6sar to succeed him in B.C. 43, and Hortensius did, in fact,\r\nhand over the province to him at Thessalonica at the beginning of that\r\nyear. But meanwhile Antony had induced the Senate to nominate himself\r\n(June, B.C. 44). He withdrew five of the legions and then managed to get\r\nthe province transferred to his brother Gaius. When Antony was declared\r\na _hostis_, the Senate revoked the nomination of Gaius and restored the\r\nprovince, along with Illyricum, to M. Brutus, who was in fact already in\r\npossession, having defeated and captured Gaius Antonius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (9) GREECE.]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with Macedonia was GREECE, which had been left, since\r\nB.C. 146, in a somewhat anomalous position. Thessaly indeed, was, to\r\na great extent, incorporated with Macedonia; but the towns in B\xc5\x93otia,\r\nas well as Athens and Sparta, were nominally free, though connected\r\nwith Rome in such a way as to be sometimes spoken of separately as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprovinces.\xe2\x80\x9d So with the towns in the Peloponnese once forming the Ach\xc3\xa6an\r\nLeague. The League was dissolved and each town had a separate _f\xc5\x93dus_\r\nor charter.[55] But with all this local autonomy Greece was practically\r\ngoverned by Rome, and in certain cases the propr\xc3\xa6tor of Macedonia\r\nexercised jurisdiction in it. But as yet there was no \xe2\x80\x9cprovince\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nGreece or even of Achaia, with a separate proconsul or propr\xc3\xa6tor. C\xc3\xa6sar,\r\nas in other cases, made temporary arrangements which afterwards became\r\npermanent under Augustus. In B.C. 48, Q. Fufius Calenus, one of his\r\nlegates, was sent to take possession of Greek cities in C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s interest,\r\nand remained at Patr\xc3\xa6 with troops till B.C. 47, exercising authority\r\nover the whole of the Peloponnese.[56] In the autumn he went home and\r\nwas rewarded by the consulship for the rest of the year. But in B.C.\r\n46, C\xc3\xa6sar appointed Serv. Sulpicius Rufus governor of Greece, and his\r\nauthority seems to have extended throughout the Peloponnese and as far\r\nnorth as Thessaly.[57] Sulpicius returned to Rome at the end of B.C.\r\n45, or beginning of B.C. 44, and does not seem to have had a successor.\r\nGreece appears to have been tacitly allowed to revert to its old position\r\nof nominal freedom and real attachment to Macedonia. M. Brutus at any\r\nrate, as governor of Macedonia, assumed that he had authority in Greece.\r\nAfter the re-arrangement at Philippi (B.C. 42), it fell to Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshare, who, for a time at least, yielded Achaia to Sext. Pompeius.[58]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Asiatic Provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (10) BITHYNIA AND PONTUS.]\r\n\r\nAs C\xc3\xa6sar was meditating a settlement of Syria, it was important that the\r\nAsiatic provinces should be in safe hands. To BITHYNIA and PONTUS\xe2\x80\x94among\r\nthe newest of Roman provinces\xe2\x80\x94L. Tillius Cimber had been nominated.\r\nWe know nothing of his antecedents except that we find him among the\r\ninfluential friends of C\xc3\xa6sar in B.C. 46; but his provincial appointment\r\nwas readily confirmed by the Senate after his share in C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death.[59]\r\nHe devoted himself to the collection of a fleet, with which he aided the\r\npursuit of Dolabella, and afterwards assisted Brutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (11) ASIA.]\r\n\r\nThe province of ASIA was quiet and wealthy. For financial and strategic\r\nreasons it was specially necessary at this time to have it in safe hands.\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar had nominated C. Trebonius, who had been his legate in Gaul and\r\nBritain, and had often been intrusted with important commands. He had\r\nstuck to his old general in the civil war and had been rewarded by the\r\npr\xc3\xa6torship of B.C. 48, and the province of Farther Spain in the next\r\nyear. Though he was not successful in Spain C\xc3\xa6sar continued to trust\r\nhim sufficiently to send him to Asia. He did not actually strike a blow\r\nin the assassination, but he aided it by withdrawing Antony from the\r\nSenate on a treacherous pretence of business. His appointment was readily\r\nconfirmed by the Senate, and he went to Asia purposing to fortify towns\r\nand collect troops to aid the party of the assassins. It was this\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nalone his participation in the murder\xe2\x80\x94which caused Dolabella, probably at\r\nthe instigation and certainly with the approval of Antony,[60] to put him\r\nto death when refused admittance by him into Smyrna or Pergamus. At the\r\nend of the year the Senate had arranged that he was to be succeeded by\r\none of the Consuls, Hirtius or Pansa. But after his murder the province\r\nremained in the hands of his qu\xc3\xa6stor,[61] and on the death of Hirtius and\r\nPansa at Mutina it was transferred by the Senate to M. Brutus (to be held\r\nwith Macedonia), who in the course of B.C. 42 made a progress through it\r\nto hold the _conventus_, to collect men and money, and to meet Cassius.\r\nIt was, no doubt, heavily taxed; and after the battle of Philippi Antony\r\ntook possession of it and again unmercifully drained its resources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (12) CILICIA.]\r\n\r\nOn quitting the province of CILICIA in July, B.C. 50, Cicero left it in\r\ncharge of his qu\xc3\xa6stor, C. C\xc3\xa6lius Caldus. Whether, in the confusion of the\r\nfirst years of civil war, any successor was appointed we do not know.\r\nThe province needed some resettlement, for in B.C. 47 C\xc3\xa6sar stopped at\r\nTarsus, on his way to Pontus, for some days, to meet the chief men and\r\nmake certain regulations, of which he does not tell us the nature.[62]\r\nBut it seems that then, or shortly afterwards, it was considerably\r\nreduced in extent. The Phrygian \xe2\x80\x9cdioceses\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Laodicea, Apamea, and\r\nSynnada\xe2\x80\x94were assigned to Asia, as well as most of Pisidia and Pamphylia.\r\nThe remainder\xe2\x80\x94Cilicia Aspera, and Campestris, with Cyprus\xe2\x80\x94seem to have\r\nbeen held somewhat irregularly by C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s own legates. It was afterwards\r\ntreated by Antony as though at his own disposal, Cyprus and Cilicia\r\nAspera being presented to Cleopatra, part of Phrygia with Lycaonia,\r\nIsaurica, and Pisidia to Amyntas, king of Galatia. The province, in\r\nfact, as known to Cicero, was almost separated from the Empire until\r\nreorganised by Augustus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (13) SYRIA.]\r\n\r\nThe province of SYRIA was extremely important in view of the danger from\r\nthe Parthians. Bounded on the north by Mount Amanus it included Ph\xc5\x93nicia\r\nand C\xc5\x93le-Syria as far south as the head of the Red Sea and the eastern\r\nmouth of the Nile. On the east it was bounded by the Euphrates and the\r\ndeserts of Arabia. After the organisation of Pompey in B.C. 63 it had\r\nbeen administered by proconsuls and the usual staff. In B.C. 57-6 it was\r\nheld by Gabinius, who employed his forces for the restoration of Ptolemy\r\nAuletes to the throne of Egypt. In B.C. 54-3 it was held by Crassus; and\r\nafter his fall at Carrh\xc3\xa6 it was successfully defended and administered\r\nby C. Cassius as _qu\xc3\xa6stor_ and _proqu\xc3\xa6stor_. In B.C. 51-50, while Cicero\r\nwas in Cilicia, it was ruled by Bibulus; and in B.C. 49 Pompey secured\r\nit for his father-in-law, Q. C\xc3\xa6cilius Metellus Scipio, who collected\r\ntroops and went to the aid of Pompey in Thessaly, and after Pharsalia\r\nescaped to Africa. It was then put in the hands of the qu\xc3\xa6stor, Sextus\r\nIulius, a connection of the Dictator, with some legions, one of which\r\nhad been left there by C\xc3\xa6sar in anticipation of the coming Parthian war.\r\nBut a new complication had been introduced by Q. C\xc3\xa6cilius Bassus. This\r\nman had been with Pompey at Pharsalia and had escaped to Syria, where\r\nfor a time he lived obscurely. But after a while, by tampering with\r\nthe soldiers of Sextus Iulius, who was both incompetent and vicious,\r\nhe induced them to assassinate their commander and transfer their\r\nallegiance to himself.[63] Professing to be lawful proconsul of Syria\r\nhe fortified himself in Apamea, and there repulsed forces sent by C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nunder Antistius Vetus and L. Statius Murcus successively. He made some\r\nagreement with the Parthians which secured their aid;[64] and though\r\nMurcus was reinforced by Crispus governor of Bithynia, Bassus was still\r\nunsubdued at the time of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death. There had been, therefore,\r\na double need for a strong man in Syria, and C\xc3\xa6sar had nominated C.\r\nCassius, the former defender of it against the Parthians. After C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, however, Dolabella secured the passing of a law transferring Syria\r\nto himself with the command against the Parthians. But some irregularity\r\nin the auguries taken at the comitia gave Cassius a plausible excuse\r\nfor ignoring this law. Consequently when Dolabella entered the province\r\nfrom the north, Cassius did so from the south. After some successful\r\nmovements in Palestine, Cassius induced Murcus and Crispus, and finally\r\nBassus himself, to hand over their legions to him, as well as Trebonius\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegate, Allienus, who was bringing some legions from Egypt.[65] Thus\r\nreinforced he shut up Dolabella in Laodicea and frightened him into\r\ncommitting suicide. Syria therefore remained in the hands of Cassius; and\r\nwhen he fell at Philippi it was vacant. In accordance with the agreement\r\nmade with Octavian after that battle it fell to the lot of Antony, who\r\nretained it personally, or by his legates, till his death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (14) EGYPT.]\r\n\r\nEGYPT was still an independent kingdom, ruled since B.C. 47 by Cleopatra.\r\nNevertheless, there was a considerable Roman force stationed in it,\r\npartly left by Gabinius, when he restored Ptolemy Auletes in B.C. 57-6,\r\npartly stationed there by C\xc3\xa6sar himself. They must have been somewhat\r\nin the position of the English troops supporting the authority of the\r\nKhedive, but prepared to resist all outside interference. So in this case\r\nthe Romans retained a preponderating influence, though with no legal\r\nauthority or right of raising revenue. These troops appear to have been\r\nin a very disorderly state, and in B.C. 50 murdered two of the sons of\r\nBibulus who were among their officers.[66]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (15) CYRENE AND CRETE.]\r\n\r\nThe district between Egypt and Roman Africa, called CYRENE, was once\r\njoined to Egypt and then governed by a king of its own (B.C. 117). This\r\nking (Ptolemy Apion), dying in B.C. 96 without issue, left his dominions\r\nto the Romans. The Roman government took over the royal estates, and\r\nplaced a tax on the principal product of the country\xe2\x80\x94silphium (valuable\r\nfor its medicinal qualities)\xe2\x80\x94but did not organise it as a province.\r\nThe five principal cities[67] were allowed to retain a pretty complete\r\nautonomy. But upon disagreements between these states breaking out, the\r\nwhole country in B.C. 74 was reduced to the form of a province governed\r\nby a _qu\xc3\xa6stor pro pr\xc3\xa6tore_.[68] Six years later (B.C. 68-7) complaints\r\nas to the harbouring of pirates caused Q. C\xc3\xa6cilius Metellus to reduce\r\nCRETE also.[69] When Pompey superseded Metellus in B.C. 67, he introduced\r\ncertain changes in the administration of both provinces, though there\r\nis no proof that he combined them as was done at a later date. In B.C.\r\n44 indeed, they were assigned separately\xe2\x80\x94Crete to Brutus and Cyrene to\r\nCassius[70]\xe2\x80\x94while Antony produced a memorandum of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s directing that\r\nCrete should be restored to liberty,[71] that is, should cease to pay\r\n_tributum_. At the division of the provinces after Philippi both were\r\nassigned to Antony, and he assumed the right some years later of forming\r\nout of them a kingdom for his daughter by Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general disorders in the Empire.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen therefore that at C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death there was hardly any\r\npart of the Empire in which there were not elements of mischief more or\r\nless active. The most peaceful district was perhaps Greece, though it\r\nmanaged to put itself under the frown of the triumvirs by sympathising\r\nwith Brutus, and later on under that of Octavian by sympathising with\r\nAntony. The disturbances which most affected the actual residents in Rome\r\nand Italy were those in Sicily and Sardinia, Gaul and Illyricum. The\r\nman who should put an end to these would seem a saviour of society. The\r\nstruggles in the far East, though from a financial point of view they\r\nwere of considerable importance, would not loom so large in the eyes of\r\nthe Italians. We have now to trace the steps by which Augustus was able\r\nto satisfy the needs of the state; to restore peace and plenty to Italy;\r\nto organise and safeguard the provinces; and thus to be almost worshipped\r\nas the visible guarantee of order and tranquillity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INHERITANCE\r\n\r\n    _Cui dabit partes scelus_\r\n    _expiandi Iuppiter?_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: News of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s murder brought to Apollonia, March, B.C. 44.]\r\n\r\nThe news of his great-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s death reached Octavius at Apollonia in the\r\nafternoon, just as he and his suite were going to dinner. A vague rumour\r\nof some great misfortune quickly spread through the town, and many of\r\nthe leading inhabitants hastened to the house with zealous friendliness\r\nto ascertain its truth. After a hasty consultation with his friends,\r\nOctavius decided to get rid of most of them while inviting a few of the\r\nhighest rank to discuss with him what should be done. This being effected\r\nwith some difficulty, an anxious debate was carried on into the night.\r\nOpinions were divided. One party urged Octavius to go to the army in\r\nMacedonia, appeal to its attachment to C\xc3\xa6sar, and call on the legions\r\nto follow him to Rome to avenge the murdered Dictator.[72] Those who\r\nthus advised trusted to the impression likely to be made by Octavius\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersonal charm and the pity which his position would excite. Others\r\nthought this too great an undertaking for so young a man. They argued\r\nthat the many friends whom C\xc3\xa6sar had raised to positions of honour and\r\nprofit might be trusted to avenge his murder. They did not yet know that\r\ntheirs were the very hands which had struck him down. After listening to\r\nthe various opinions Octavius resolved to take no decisive step until\r\nhe had reached Italy, had consulted his friends there, and had seen the\r\nstate of affairs with his own eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavius prepares to go to Italy, April, B.C. 44.]\r\n\r\nPreparations for crossing were begun at once, and in the few days before\r\nthe start farther details of the assassination reached Apollonia. The\r\ncitizens begged Octavius to stay, putting all the resources of the town\r\nat his disposal; and a number of officers and soldiers came from the\r\narmy with tenders of service, whether to guard his person or to avenge\r\nthe Dictator. But for the present he declined all offers. He thanked the\r\nApolloniates and promised the town immunities and privileges\xe2\x80\x94a promise\r\nwhich in after years he did not forget. He told the officers and soldiers\r\nthat he would claim their services at some future time. For the present\r\nhe did not need them: \xe2\x80\x9conly let them be ready when the time came.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nconduct of the Martia and Quarta a few months later shewed that these\r\nfeelings were genuine and lasting.\r\n\r\nOctavius had a poor vessel and a stormy crossing, but landed in safety,\r\nprobably at Hydruntum (_Otranto_), the nearest point in Calabria, and in\r\nfair weather only a five hours\xe2\x80\x99 voyage.[73] That fact and the state of\r\nthe wind may have influenced the choice of the port. But he was also too\r\nmuch in the dark as to affairs in Italy to venture upon such a frequented\r\nlanding-place as Brundisium, where he might have found himself in the\r\nmidst of political enemies or hostile troops. From Hydruntum he went by\r\nland to Lupi\xc3\xa6, rather more than half way to Brundisium. There he first\r\nmet some who had witnessed C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, had heard the recitation of\r\nhis will, and could tell him that he was adopted as C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s son, and\r\n(with a deduction of a liberal legacy to the citizens) was heir to\r\nthree-quarters of his property,[74] the remaining fourth being divided\r\nbetween C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s two other grand-nephews Q. Pedius and Lucius Pinarius.\r\nHe learnt also that the Dictator\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, which by his will was to be\r\nconducted by Atia, had been performed in the Forum amidst great popular\r\nexcitement, caused partly by the sight of his wounded body,[75] partly by\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s speech, and had been followed by attacks on the houses of the\r\nchief assassins, who, after barricading themselves for three days on the\r\nCapitol, had found it necessary to retire from Rome, first to the villa\r\nof Brutus at Lanuvium, and then to Antium,[76] in spite of the amnesty\r\nvoted in the Senate on the 17th of March.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian accepts the inheritance and name, May, B.C. 44.]\r\n\r\nThough deeply moved by this story Octavian did not allow his feelings\r\nto betray him into taking any false or hasty step. _Satis celeriter\r\nquod satis bene_ was his motto now as in after life.[77] He went on to\r\nBrundisium, having ascertained that it was not occupied by enemies, and\r\nthere received letters from his mother and stepfather confirming what he\r\nhad already heard. His mother begged him to join her at once, to avoid\r\nthe jealousies roused by his adoption. Philippus advised him to accept\r\nneither inheritance nor name, and to hold aloof from public business.\r\nThe advice was, no doubt, prompted by affection, and was natural in\r\nthe circumstances. But though Octavian never blustered, neither did he\r\neasily turn aside: he wrote back declaring his determination to accept.\r\nHis own friends henceforth addressed him as \xe2\x80\x9cC\xc3\xa6sar,\xe2\x80\x9d his full name now\r\nbeing Gaius Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar Octavianus.[78] The adoption indeed was not\r\ncomplete without the formal passing of a _lex curiata_; but though that\r\nwas delayed for more than a year, the new name was assumed at once. He\r\ncomplied with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wish that he should visit her first, and he\r\nsoon had the satisfaction of feeling that though Philippus was still\r\nopposed, her heart was with him in the manly resolve to sustain the great\r\npart which C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s affection had assigned to him. Cicero mentions in a\r\nletter of April 11th that Octavius had arrived in Italy, and on the 18th\r\nthat he had reached Naples. On the 19th Balbus\xe2\x80\x94the Dictator\xe2\x80\x99s friend and\r\nagent\xe2\x80\x94called on him and learned from his own lips his resolve to accept\r\nthe inheritance. On the 22nd Cicero met him at his stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s villa\r\nnear Puteoli, and anxiously watched for any indication of his political\r\naims. He was only partly satisfied.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOctavius here treats me with great respect and friendliness.\r\n    His own people addressed him as \xe2\x80\x98C\xc3\xa6sar,\xe2\x80\x99 but as Philippus did\r\n    not do so, I did not do it either. I declare it is impossible\r\n    for him to be a good citizen! He is surrounded by such a number\r\n    of people who actually threaten our friends with death. He says\r\n    the present state of things is intolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d[79]\r\n\r\nIt was not Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s cue as yet to break openly with the aristocrats.\r\nThe first struggles for his rights were likely to be with Antony, in\r\nwhich the aid of Cicero and his party would be useful. At the same time\r\nhe was too cautious and self-controlled to commit himself or betray his\r\nreal intentions, which remained an enigma to the emotional orator, who\r\nhardly ever spoke without doing so. Cicero consoled himself by the\r\nreflection that at any rate Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s claims must cause a quarrel with\r\nAntony. Yet he was indignant that this stripling could go to Rome without\r\nrisk, while Brutus and Cassius and the other \xe2\x80\x9cheroes\xe2\x80\x9d of the dagger could\r\nnot. Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s journey to Rome was for the twofold purpose of giving\r\nformal notice to the pr\xc3\xa6tor urbanus that he accepted the inheritance, and\r\nof making a statement of his intentions as administrator of the will at a\r\npublic assembly. For the latter he needed to be introduced to the meeting\r\nby a tribune. For this service he relied on Lucius Antonius. All three\r\nbrothers were in office this year\xe2\x80\x94Marcus consul, Gaius pr\xc3\xa6tor, Lucius\r\ntribune; and as supporters of the late C\xc3\xa6sar they could not in decency\r\nrefuse him this opportunity of declaring his sentiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian and M. Antonius.]\r\n\r\nOctavian reached Rome in the first week of May, duly accepted the\r\ninheritance, and was introduced to a _contio_ by Lucius Antonius about\r\nthe 10th of that month.[80] The speech was not satisfactory to the\r\nCiceronian party. He declared his intention to carry out his \xe2\x80\x9cfather\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwill as to the legacy to the people, and to celebrate the games at the\r\ndedication of the temple of Venus promised by C\xc3\xa6sar. Preparations for\r\nthem were begun at once, two of the Dictator\xe2\x80\x99s friends, Matius and\r\nPostumius, being selected to superintend them.[81] But though confining\r\nhimself to expressions of veneration for his \xe2\x80\x9cfather\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d memory, and\r\nuttering no threats against any one, Octavian had not given up for a\r\nmoment his resolve to punish the murderers. The amnesty voted in the\r\nSenate he regarded as a temporary expedient. All that was needed was an\r\naccuser, and he did not mean that such a person should be long wanting.\r\nBut meanwhile his first business was to secure his own position and the\r\npossession of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s property. This at once brought him into collision\r\nwith Antony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The money at the temple of Ops.]\r\n\r\nThe financial arrangements of the late Dictator were to a great degree to\r\nblame for this. He seems to have introduced the system of the _fiscus_,\r\nthough without the name known in later times: that is, large sums of\r\nmoney were deposited in the temple of Ops to his order, separate from the\r\npublic _\xc3\xa6rarium_ of the temple of Saturnus, and not clearly distinguished\r\nfrom his own private property. It was as though a Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer paid portions of the revenue to his private banking account,\r\nand were to die suddenly without leaving any means of distinguishing\r\nbetween public and private property.[82] Cicero says that this money\r\n(700,000,000 sesterces, or about five and a half millions sterling) was\r\nthe proceeds of the sale of confiscated properties,[83] and there was, it\r\nseems, much other property in lands and houses from the same source. The\r\nclaim by an heir of C\xc3\xa6sar would be met by a double opposition\xe2\x80\x94from the\r\ngovernment, which would regard the whole as public; and from the owners\r\nor their representatives, who might have hopes of recovering parts of it.\r\nFor at Rome confiscation did not bar claims under marriage settlements,\r\nor for debts secured on properties. The large sum at the temple of Ops\r\nhad been taken over entirely by Antony the Consul, nominally as being\r\npublic money, really\xe2\x80\x94as Cicero affirms\xe2\x80\x94to liquidate his own enormous\r\ndebts. It is very likely that Antony shared the spoil with others,\r\nperhaps with his colleague Dolabella, and they may have satisfied their\r\nconsciences with some partial use of it for public purposes.[84] At\r\nany rate it was not forthcoming when Octavian put in his claim. Even\r\nin regard to such property as was handed over to him he was constantly\r\nharassed by lawsuits. Claimants were instigated, as he believed, by one\r\nor other of the Antonies; while Gaius Antonius, acting _pr\xc3\xa6tor urbanus_\r\nfor Brutus, would often preside in the court. He was resolved, however,\r\nto carry out C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s will, even if he had to sell his own paternal estate\r\nand draw upon his mother\xe2\x80\x99s resources. But it seems, after all, that the\r\nproperty of C\xc3\xa6sar which he did manage to get, or his own wealth, was so\r\nample, that he was able to do this without crippling himself. Pinarius\r\nand Pedius got their shares, but handed them over to him, perhaps as\r\nbeing too heavily weighted with legacies to be of much value to them, or\r\nthinking that his great future made it a good investment. At any rate\r\nthe legacies were paid, the games given, and when some months later he\r\nproceeded to enroll two legions of veterans he was able to pay each man\r\na bounty amounting to something like \xc2\xa320 of our money.[85] At no time in\r\nhis career does he seem to have had serious money difficulties. No doubt\r\nhis resources were always large, but he must also have had the valuable\r\nfaculty of husbanding them in small matters, while always having enough\r\nfor large outlays.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties about Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s adoption.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not only in regard to money that Octavian found himself\r\nthwarted by Antony and his brothers. A tribune, probably Lucius Antonius\r\nhimself, prevented the formal passing of the _lex curiata_ for his\r\nadoption, with a view of weakening his claims upon the inheritance. When\r\nhe wished to be elected tribune in the place of Cinna, who had fallen\r\na victim to the mob in mistake for L. Cinna, a pr\xc3\xa6tor who had spoken\r\nagainst C\xc3\xa6sar, he was prevented by the partisans of Antony.[86] There\r\nwas indeed a legal obstacle in the fact that he was now a patrician,[87]\r\nwas under age, and had not held the qu\xc3\xa6storship, though this last was\r\na breach of custom rather than of law. Lastly, Antony treated him with\r\nstudied disrespect, keeping him waiting in his ante-room; while Lucius\r\nAntonius and the other tribunes forbade him to place C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s gilded chair\r\nin the Circus at his games.[88]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian and the Optimates. After the meeting of the Senate in\r\nJune.]\r\n\r\nIt was clear that a breach between the two was imminent. The younger man\r\nwas not abashed by the years or high office of the other; and though some\r\nformal reconciliation was brought about by common friends or by military\r\nofficers, Octavian seems to have allowed the Ciceronians to believe that\r\nhe intended to join them in opposing Antony. His attentions to them\r\nbecame more marked after the meeting of the Senate of the 1st of June. To\r\nthis meeting the Constitutionalists had been looking forward as likely\r\nto bring the uncertainty to an end. At it the question of the provinces\r\nwas to be settled; the two consuls, with the aid of a committee, were to\r\nreport on what were the genuine _acta_ of C\xc3\xa6sar; and some means were to\r\nbe found to enable Brutus and Cassius to carry on their duties as pr\xc3\xa6tors\r\nin Rome with safety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s _acta_ and veterans.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Antony had been availing himself of the papers of C\xc3\xa6sar as\r\nthough the committee had already reported. He had also been securing\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94as he thought\xe2\x80\x94by visiting the colonies of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s veterans in\r\nCampania[89] and by gradually collecting a bodyguard. This had now\r\nassumed sufficiently formidable proportions to overawe the Senate.[90] It\r\nis true that he had experienced difficulties at Capua, where the existing\r\ncoloni resented his attempt to plant others in the same territory; but,\r\non the whole, he seems to have improved his position by his tour in April\r\nand May. Then again Lepidus had visited Sext. Pompeius in Spain, and was\r\nreported to have induced him, on condition of recovering his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproperty, to return to Rome and place his naval and military forces\r\n(amounting to more than six legions) at the disposal of the consuls.[91]\r\nThis, thinks Cicero, would make Antony irresistible; and so no doubt\r\nthought Octavian also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The position of Brutus and Cassius. The change of provinces.]\r\n\r\nNor did the meetings of the Senate in June effect anything to dissipate\r\nthese fears. What was done for Brutus and Cassius satisfied neither\r\nparty. They were offered the _cura annon\xc3\xa6_, superintendence of the\r\ncorn supply\xe2\x80\x94Cassius in Sicily, Brutus in Asia\xe2\x80\x94which would give them a\r\ndecent pretext for being absent from Rome for the rest of the year.\r\nThey, however, regarded this offer as an insult.[92] So also in regard\r\nto the provinces: Brutus and Cassius were deprived of Macedonia and\r\nSyria, which C\xc3\xa6sar had assigned to them respectively, and were offered\r\nthe unimportant governorships of Crete and Cyrene. But Antony in the\r\nsame meetings secured still greater military strength for himself by an\r\narrangement with Dolabella. The latter was appointed to Syria and the\r\ncommand against the Parthians by a _lex_; and he then induced the Senate\r\nto give Macedonia to himself, with the command of the legions stationed\r\nthere, one of which he had bargained with Dolabella to hand over to him.\r\nThese decrees having been passed,[93] he sent his brother Gaius over at\r\nonce to announce the fact to the legions in Macedonia and to give them\r\nnotice that they might at any time be summoned to Italy. For Antony\r\nhimself had no intention of going to Macedonia. His private resolve was\r\nto hold Gallia Cisalpina with the largest force possible, as giving him\r\nmost hold on Italy. He had only accepted Macedonia in order to get these\r\nlegions into his hands. At the same time he carried a repeal of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaw confining the tenure of a province for a propr\xc3\xa6tor to one, and for a\r\nproconsul to two, years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony gets himself nominated to Cisalpina Gaul.]\r\n\r\nThough this increasing power of Antony was naturally calculated to alarm\r\nOctavius, he was, on the other hand, opposed to Decimus Brutus\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthe assassins\xe2\x80\x94retaining Gallia Cisalpina. He therefore supported Antony\r\nin carrying a law conferring that province on him at the end of his\r\nconsulship.[94] The Senators now saw that they had been tricked. They had\r\ngiven Antony the Macedonian legions without conditions, and he would now\r\nuse them in another province given him by a _lex_\xe2\x80\x94over which they had no\r\ncontrol. Suggestions were made to remove Gallia Cisalpina from the list\r\nof provinces, and incorporate it (as was afterwards done by Augustus) in\r\nItaly, thus doing away with any pretext for a proconsul residing there\r\nwith legions. But for the present the law stood which assigned it to\r\nAntony for B.C. 43. It appears to have been passed by the beginning of\r\nJuly, and he at once sent word to his brother to bring the legions over.\r\nThey were expected in July,[95] but did not actually arrive till nearly\r\nthree months later. Meanwhile a war of recriminations was maintained\r\nbetween Antony the consul and Brutus and Cassius the pr\xc3\xa6tors by letters\r\nor edicts. Antony accused the pr\xc3\xa6tors of collecting forces hostile to\r\nthe government, the pr\xc3\xa6tors accused Antony of making it impossible for\r\nthem to come to Rome by denouncing them in speeches and edicts, in breach\r\nof his promise. On the 1st of August L. Calpurnius Piso\xe2\x80\x94father-in-law\r\nof the late C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x94inveighed against Antony in the Senate, ending with\r\na hostile motion, of the exact nature of which we are not informed.\r\nBut he could get no one to speak or vote with him, so completely cowed\r\nwere the Senators by Antony\xe2\x80\x99s military forces.[96] On the other hand,\r\nAntony was uneasy at the growing popularity of Octavian, especially\r\namong the veterans. He had himself made a bid for their favour by two\r\ncommissions for assigning land to them both in Italy and the provinces.\r\nBut the veterans were suspicious; they had expected some signal act of\r\nvengeance for the murder of C\xc3\xa6sar; and at the same time Antony\xe2\x80\x99s lavish\r\ngrants of public land to unworthy favourites impoverished the exchequer\r\nand diminished the amount available for distribution. They lowered his\r\npopularity with the veterans as much as they annoyed the Senators, who\r\nyet did not venture to oppose him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempted assassination of Antony.]\r\n\r\nThe friction between the two men\xe2\x80\x94varied by occasional\r\nreconciliations\xe2\x80\x94became more and more acute, until about the end of\r\nSeptember it was rumoured that Octavian had suborned men to assassinate\r\nAntony. Of course Octavian disclaimed it, and upon Antony giving out that\r\ncertain men had been found in his house with daggers, he went openly\r\nwith an offer to serve along with his friends among his bodyguards. The\r\npopular belief was that Antony had invented the whole story to discredit\r\nhim; but Cicero and others of his party both believed and approved, and\r\nsubsequent writers are divided in opinion. Nicolas of Damascus probably\r\ngives Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s own version, according to which Antony was unable to\r\nproduce the pretended assassins to a council of his friends, or to\r\ninduce them to advise active retaliation upon Octavian. Appian points\r\nout that it was not to Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s interest just then that Antony should\r\ndisappear, for it would have been a great encouragement to the party of\r\nthe Assassins, of whose real sentiments towards himself he was no doubt\r\naware.[97]\r\n\r\nFor with this party his alliance was a matter of great doubt. In June\r\nCicero had said of him:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian and the Optimates.]\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIn Octavian, as I have perceived, there is no little ability\r\n    and spirit; and he seems likely to be as well disposed to our\r\n    heroes as I could wish. But what confidence one can feel in a\r\n    man of his age, name, inheritance, and upbringing may well give\r\n    us pause. His stepfather, whom I saw at Antium, thinks none at\r\n    all. However, we must foster him, and, if nothing else, keep\r\n    him estranged from Antony. Marcellus will be doing admirable\r\n    service if he gives him good advice. Octavian seems devoted to\r\n    him, but has no great confidence in Pansa and Hirtius.\xe2\x80\x9d[98]\r\n\r\nPhilippus was not a man for whom Cicero had a great respect.[99] But\r\nMarcellus, the husband of Octavia (Cos. B.C. 50), was a sound aristocrat\r\nand a trustworthy man. Still Octavian had done nothing since to identify\r\nhimself with the conservative party, in spite of his differences with\r\nAntony. With Cicero himself he kept up friendly communications; yet at\r\nthe final breach between Cicero and Antony in September, it does not seem\r\nto have occurred to Cicero to put forward Octavian as Antony\xe2\x80\x99s opponent;\r\nnor does he mention him in the first two Philippics. It was Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown independent action which first shewed that he was ready and able to\r\nassume that position, and Cicero viewed this at first with anxiety and\r\nalmost dismay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian enrolls veterans.]\r\n\r\nAntony left Rome on the 9th of October to meet the Macedonian legions\r\nat Brundisium. Octavian no longer hesitated. Sending agents to tamper\r\nwith the loyalty of the newly arrived legions, he himself went a round\r\nof the veterans in Campania, offering them a bounty of 500 denarii\r\n(about \xc2\xa320), if they would enlist again. In doing this he acted wholly\r\non his own initiative and without authority from Senate or people, and\r\nwithout holding any office giving him military command.[100] In after\r\nyears Augustus regarded this as the first step in his public career,\r\nthe first service rendered to the State: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen nineteen years old I\r\nraised an army on my own initiative and at my own expense, with which\r\nI restored to liberty the republic which had been crushed under the\r\ntyranny of a faction.\xe2\x80\x9d And not only did he reckon this his first public\r\nservice; the wording of this statement is a declaration that he thereby\r\nadopted the policy and was continuing the work of his \xe2\x80\x9cfather,\xe2\x80\x9d for he\r\nuses the very phrase which C\xc3\xa6sar had used in justifying himself.[101]\r\nThis phrase illustrates another point also. Ostensibly the enrolment of\r\nveterans was to protect himself against Antony. Perhaps he did not yet\r\nsee how it was to be done, but at the bottom of his heart was the purpose\r\nof checkmating, if not destroying, the clique which had caused C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmurder, though for the moment he was with them in opposition to Antony,\r\nand was eager to have Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s support and approval. Yet how doubtful and\r\nuneasy the orator felt is shewn by two letters in which he tells what\r\nOctavian was doing.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPuteoli, 2 November. On the evening of the 1st I got a letter\r\n    from Octavian. He is entering upon a serious undertaking.\r\n    He has won over to his views all the veterans at Casilinum\r\n    and Calatia. And no wonder: he gives a bounty of 500 denarii\r\n    apiece. Clearly his view is a war with Antony under his own\r\n    leadership. So I perceive that before many days are over we\r\n    shall be in arms. But whom are we to follow? Consider his name,\r\n    consider his age! Again, he demands to begin with a secret\r\n    interview with me at Capua of all places! It is really quite\r\n    childish to suppose that it can be kept quiet. I have written\r\n    to explain to him that it is neither necessary nor practicable.\r\n    He sent a certain C\xc3\xa6cina of Volaterr\xc3\xa6 to me, an intimate friend\r\n    of his own, who brought me news that Antony was on his way to\r\n    the city with the _Alaud\xc3\xa6_, was imposing money contribution\r\n    on the municipal towns, and was marching at the head of the\r\n    legion with colours flying. He wanted my opinion, whether he\r\n    should start for Rome with his legion of 3,000 veterans, or\r\n    should hold Capua, and so intercept Antony\xe2\x80\x99s advance, or should\r\n    join the three Macedonian legions now sailing by the Mare\r\n    Superum, which he hopes are devoted to himself. They refused\r\n    to accept a bounty offered them by Antony, as my informant at\r\n    least asserts. They even used grossly insulting language to\r\n    him and moved off when he attempted to address them. In short,\r\n    Octavian offers himself as our military leader, and thinks\r\n    that our right policy is to stand by him. On my part I advised\r\n    his making for Rome. For I think he will have, not only the\r\n    city mob, but, if he can impress them with confidence, the\r\n    loyalists also on his side. Oh, Brutus! Where are you! What an\r\n    opportunity you are losing! I did not actually foresee this,\r\n    but I thought that something of the sort would happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPuteoli [3] November. Two letters on the same day from\r\n    Octavian! His present view is that I should come to Rome at\r\n    once, and that he wishes to act through the Senate. I told him\r\n    that a meeting of the Senate was impossible before the 1st of\r\n    January, and I believe it is so. But he adds also, \xe2\x80\x98and by your\r\n    advice.\xe2\x80\x99 In short he insists, while I suspend judgment. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n    trust his youth, I am in the dark as to his disposition, I am\r\n    not able to do anything without your friend Pansa. I am afraid\r\n    of Antony succeeding, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like moving far from the sea.\r\n    At the same time I fear some great _coup_ being struck without\r\n    my being there. Varro for his part dislikes the youth\xe2\x80\x99s plan.\r\n    I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him. He has forces on which he can depend.\r\n    He can count on Decimus Brutus, and is making no secret of his\r\n    intentions. He is organising his men in companies at Capua, he\r\n    is paying them their bounty money. War seems to be ever coming\r\n    nearer and nearer.\xe2\x80\x9d[102]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony\xe2\x80\x99s breach with the Senate, November-December, B.C. 44.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these half-hearted and doubtful expressions of Cicero, the\r\nSenate at his own suggestion was presently glad to approve Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naction, and to accept his aid. For events now followed quickly.\r\nWhen Antony met the legions at Brundisium, sent over by his brother\r\nGaius,[103] he seems at first to have found them ready to obey him. But\r\ndifficulties were presently promoted by the agents of Octavian, who\r\noffered the men liberal bounties, or scattered _libelli_ among them\r\ndenouncing Antony\xe2\x80\x99s tyranny and neglect of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and urging\r\nOctavian\xe2\x80\x99s claim on their allegiance. Signs of mutiny soon shewed\r\nthemselves, and after a stormy meeting at which some officers and men\r\nused insubordinate language, Antony arrested and put to death several of\r\nthe officers as ringleaders, and about 300 men.[104] These severities,\r\nfollowed by more liberal offers and some conciliatory language, seemed\r\nfor the time to put an end to the mutiny. Selecting therefore a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpr\xc3\xa6torian cohort\xe2\x80\x9d from the legions, Antony started for Rome, ordering\r\nthe rest to march in detachments up the coast road to Ariminum, where the\r\n_via \xc3\x86milia_ through the valley of the Po begins. In Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s letters\r\nof the 8th, 11th, and 12th of November are recorded the various rumours\r\nof his approach, and the anxieties as to what he intended to do at\r\nRome.[105] He arrived about the 20th in full military array, and entered\r\nthe city with a strong bodyguard, the rest of his men being encamped\r\noutside the walls. He did not stay long however. Having summoned the\r\nSenate for the 25th, in an edict, in which he denounced the character and\r\naims of Octavian,[106] he went to Tibur, where he had ordered his new\r\nlevies to muster. Here he delivered a speech, which Cicero afterwards\r\ndescribed as \xe2\x80\x9cpestilent.\xe2\x80\x9d[107] On the 25th, however, he did not appear\r\nin the Senate. A second edict postponed the meeting to the 29th. Cicero\r\ninsinuates that his non-appearance on the 25th was caused by some extra\r\ndebauch. But, in fact, the reason may have been the news about the _legio\r\nMartia_, which, instead of going to Ariminum, had turned off from the\r\ncoast road and reached Alba Fucensis. It might be of course that the\r\nlegion was on its way to join Antony at Tibur, to which there was a good\r\nroad from Alba Fucensis (_via Valeria_). Antony therefore went to Alba,\r\nbut found the gates closed, and was greeted by a shower of arrows from\r\nthe walls. It was clear that this legion at least did not mean to serve\r\nhim. He came to Rome for the meeting of the Senate on the 29th, but was\r\ninformed just before it that the Quarta had followed the example of the\r\nMartia, and was at Alba Fucensis. He understood that these legions meant\r\nto join Octavian, and he no longer thought it possible to get Octavian\r\ndeclared a _hostis_, though one of his partisans was ready to propose it.\r\nHaving therefore transacted some formal business\xe2\x80\x94chiefly the allotment\r\nof provinces, in which his brother Gaius obtained Macedonia, and a\r\nsupplicatio in honour of Lepidus, he hurriedly returned to Tibur. His\r\nfriends and supporters visited him in great numbers; but within a few\r\ndays he was on his march to Ariminum to join what remained of the five\r\nMacedonian legions.[108]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s doubts as to Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s intentions.]\r\n\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s object was to attack Decimus Brutus, whose forces were\r\nconcentrated at Mutina. But at any rate, he was gone from Rome, and\r\nOctavian had won the first trick in the game. Cicero attributes Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlowered tone in the Senate, and his hurried departure, to Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromptness and success in raising the veterans, and inducing the Martia\r\nand Quarta to desert him. At first, however, he had not felt easy as to\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s intentions. Writing from Puteoli on the 5th of November\r\nhe tells Atticus that he gets a letter from Octavian every day, begging\r\nhim to come to Capua and once more to save the republic, or, if not, at\r\nleast to go to Rome. Cicero is \xe2\x80\x9cshamed to refuse and yet afraid to take\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nbut owns that Octavian is acting with vigour, and will probably enter\r\nRome in great force. But he doubts whether the young man understands\r\nthe situation, or the terrorism established by Antony in the Senate. He\r\nhad better wait, he thinks, till the new consulate begins on January\r\n1st.[109] About the 12th of November, he tells Atticus that if Octavian\r\nwins now, the fear is that he will confirm C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s _acta_ more completely\r\nthan ever, which will be against the interests of Brutus, while, if he is\r\nbeaten, Antony will become more despotic still.[110] Early in December\r\n(or the end of November), he mentions with alarm the possibility of\r\nOctavian being elected for a chance vacancy in the Tribunate[111]; and\r\nassents to a remark made by Atticus, that though Octavian had given\r\nAntony a notable check, \xe2\x80\x9cthey must wait to see the end.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he says to\r\nOppius, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot be warmly on his side without having some security that\r\nhe will cordially embrace the friendship of Brutus and Cassius and the\r\nother tyrannicides.\xe2\x80\x9d[112]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian begins his march.]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December, however, when he came to Rome after Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture, Cicero made up his mind that for the present all distrust was\r\nto be dismissed or at least concealed. Octavian had mustered his forces\r\nat Alba Fucensis, and after some communications with the Senate\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwarmly welcomed his offer of aid\xe2\x80\x94had started with his legions on the\r\ntrack of Antony; who before the end of the year began the investment of\r\nMutina, upon the refusal of Decimus Brutus to quit the province.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian is recognised by the Senate, and obtains imperium,\r\nJan. B.C. 43.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the 20th of December, Cicero himself proposed a\r\nresolution in the Senate authorising the Consuls-designate to provide for\r\nthe safe meeting of the Senate on the 1st of January; approving of an\r\nedict of Decimus Brutus, just arrived, in which he forbade any one with\r\nimperium entering his province to succeed him; directing all provincial\r\ngovernors to retain their provinces till successors were named by the\r\nSenate; and, lastly, approving the action of \xe2\x80\x9cGaius C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x9d in enrolling\r\nthe veterans, and of the Martia and Quarta in having joined him. These\r\nresolutions were to be formally put to the Senate on the 1st of January\r\nby the new consuls.[113] Accordingly on that and the following days,\r\nafter somewhat stormy debates, these decrees were passed, as well as one\r\nwhich acknowledged the services of Octavian, and gave him the rank of\r\npropr\xc3\xa6tor with imperium. It was also enacted that in regard to elections\r\nto office he should be considered to have held the qu\xc3\xa6storship. He\r\nthus became a member of the Senate, with a right of speaking among the\r\n_pr\xc3\xa6torii_, and consequently with a plausible claim to stand for the\r\nconsulship, in spite of his youth. A second decree\xe2\x80\x94after the battles at\r\nMutina\xe2\x80\x94gave him _consularia ornamenta_.[114]\r\n\r\nOctavian was now fully launched on his public career. He had shown both\r\nAntony and the Senate that he was no negligible quantity. Though the\r\nSenate neither liked nor trusted him, he had played his cards with such\r\nskill that it was forced to treat him as its champion; while Antony had\r\ncontrived to put himself in such clear opposition to the constitutional\r\nclaims of the Senate, that Octavian could attack him without thereby\r\ncommitting himself to the support of the Assassins, and had made himself\r\nso strong that (if he proved successful against Antony) he would\r\nhereafter be able to dictate his own terms. Cicero saw this clearly\r\nenough, but he hoped that the defeat of Antony would secure to the side\r\nof the Senate the governors of Gaul and Spain with their legions,[115]\r\nand that thus supported they would be able to discard their youthful\r\nchampion. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was,\xe2\x80\x9d he said later on, \xe2\x80\x9cto be complimented, distinguished,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94extinguished.\xe2\x80\x9d[116] We shall now see how the hopes of the sanguine\r\norator were once more blasted, and how all these intrigues were baffled\r\nby the wary policy and cool persistence of \xe2\x80\x9cthe boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CONSULSHIP AND TRIUMVIRATE\r\n\r\n    _Gravesque_\r\n    _principum amicitias._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s position at the beginning of B.C. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign of Mutina, in which Octavian had now embarked, was ended by\r\ntwo battles\xe2\x80\x94one at Forum Gallorum on the 15th, and another at Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncamp on the 21st of April. After the latter date there were military\r\nmovements of some interest and importance, but no actual conflict. Before\r\nthese battles Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s position had been difficult and delicate; and\r\nthough it was much improved after them, it was not in the way expected\r\nby the Senate. The change was due to his own prudence and energy. Since\r\nhis start from Alba to follow Antony the aspect of affairs at Rome had\r\nbeen much modified, and he had had good reason to doubt the favour of\r\nthe party over whom Cicero was now exercising a predominant influence.\r\nCicero appears indeed to have kept up a constant correspondence with\r\nOctavian, in which he did his best by flattery and argument to retain\r\nhis aid and lull his suspicions. But there were facts which it must\r\nhave been difficult for him to explain to Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction. It\r\nis true that besides the honours voted to him in the Senate in the\r\nfirst week of B.C. 43, he had been joined with the other magistrate\r\nin the _Senatus-consultum ultimum_, empowering them to \xe2\x80\x9csee that\r\nthe state took no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d[117] But though the decrees also gave him a\r\nconstitutional right to command soldiers,[118] yet the despatch of the\r\ntwo consuls to the seat of war deprived him of the chief command; while\r\nthe more moderate party had carried over Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s head a resolution to\r\nsend three commissioners to negotiate with Antony. Cicero asserts that\r\nthey were only authorised to convey to Antony the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s order that\r\nhe was to quit the Gallic province. That was not, however, the view of\r\nthe commissioners themselves. One of them\xe2\x80\x94Serv. Sulpicius Rufus\xe2\x80\x94died\r\non the journey; but the other two\xe2\x80\x94L. Calpurnius Piso and L. Marcius\r\nPhilippus\xe2\x80\x94brought back some proposals from Antony in February, which, had\r\nthey been accepted, might perhaps have secured the safety of Brutus and\r\nCassius, but would certainly have left Octavian out in the cold, without\r\nany pretext for keeping up his military force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony\xe2\x80\x99s proposals.]\r\n\r\nAntony proposed to give up the Cisalpine province, on condition of\r\nreceiving Transalpine Gaul\xe2\x80\x94exclusive of Narbonensis\xe2\x80\x94with the six legions\r\nalready under him, supplemented by those at present commanded by Dec.\r\nBrutus, for five years, or for such time as Brutus and Cassius should\r\nbe consuls or proconsuls. Secondly, on condition that the _acta_ of his\r\nconsulship\xe2\x80\x94including the use of the money from the temple of Ops and\r\nhis grants of lands\xe2\x80\x94should be left intact; and that those serving with\r\nhim should have complete indemnity.[119] The envoys were against the\r\nextreme measure of declaring a state of war (rather than a _tumultus_)\r\nand proclaiming Antony a _hostis_, and the majority of the Senate\r\nagreed with them and voted for further negotiations. It was a strange\r\nposition. Octavian had been authorised by the Senate to drive Antony\r\nfrom Cisalpine Gaul. One of the consuls\xe2\x80\x94Aulus Hirtius\xe2\x80\x94had left Rome with\r\ntwo legions, and had, in fact, come into contact with the enemy in a\r\ncavalry skirmish at Claterna; the other consul, Pansa, was also preparing\r\nto follow. Yet the Senate was negotiating with Antony as though he were\r\nnot a _hostis_, but a citizen with a grievance. The time was soon to come\r\nwhen Octavian, too, would find it convenient to make terms with Antony;\r\nbut nothing could have been more against his interests than the present\r\naction of the Senate. It would seem to him a cynical disregard of their\r\nmutual obligations. Nor was this the worst. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s offer as to Brutus\r\nand Cassius was only an offer to recognise an accomplished fact. These\r\ntwo leaders in the assassination had been already nominated by the Senate\r\nto Macedonia and Syria. Cicero was in constant correspondence with them,\r\naddressing them as the chief hope of the constitution, and suggesting\r\nthat their armies might be used to maintain the hold of the party on\r\nItaly. Trebonius, moreover, had been sent to Asia with the express\r\nunderstanding that he was to fortify that province and collect money to\r\nsupport Brutus and Cassius. When news came that Trebonius had been put to\r\ndeath by Dolabella, the latter was declared a _hostis_ by the Senate, and\r\nhis punishment entrusted to Cassius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Octavian.]\r\n\r\nThese facts must have gradually made it quite clear to Octavian that\r\nthe complete triumph of the Ciceronian party would be no less damaging\r\nto him than that of Antony. But though skilful use was made of them by\r\nAntony himself in a letter addressed to Hirtius and Octavian,[120] the\r\nyoung C\xc3\xa6sar was not to be induced to take any premature step. The Senate\r\nmight be dealt with hereafter: for the present the first necessity was to\r\nprevent Antony from becoming strong enough to dictate terms to himself as\r\nwell as to the Senate. He therefore quietly continued to take his part in\r\nthe campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The military situation in the spring of B.C. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe Senatorial armies commanded the district round Mutina, except\r\nBononia, Regium Lepidi, and Parma. Of these towns, the first was\r\ntwenty-three miles east of Mutina along the \xc3\x86milian road; the other two\r\nabout the same distance west of it. They were in the hands of Antony,\r\naffording him bases of operation on either side of Mutina. In the middle\r\nof February Cicero was daily expecting to hear of Dec. Brutus ending\r\nthe war by a sally from Mutina. At that time Antony\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters\r\nwere at Bononia, only a part of his troops actually investing Mutina.\r\nHirtius was at Claterna, eleven miles east of Bononia; Octavian at Forum\r\nCornelii (Imola), nine miles farther east. Bad weather had prevented\r\nserious operations, but some time in March Antony evacuated Bononia to\r\npush on the siege of Mutina with his full force. Hirtius and Octavian at\r\nonce occupied Bononia, and gradually pushed out fortified posts towards\r\nMutina;[121] for Dec. Brutus was hard pressed for food, and they feared\r\nthat he would have to surrender. But not being on an equality with\r\nAntony, especially in cavalry, they were anxious to wait for the fresh\r\nlegions from Rome under Pansa. Some minor skirmishes took place from time\r\nto time,[122] but as the days dragged on and Mutina was not relieved, the\r\nanxiety at Rome grew greater and greater. \xe2\x80\x9cI am restlessly waiting for\r\nnews,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Cicero on the 11th of April; \xe2\x80\x9cthe decisive hour is upon us;\r\nfor our whole hope depends on relieving Dec. Brutus.\xe2\x80\x9d[123] On the 15th\r\nand 16th there was a panic in the city caused by the pr\xc3\xa6tor Ventidius\r\nBassus. He had enrolled two legions of veterans, and was believed to be\r\nabout to enter Rome. He, however, marched off to Potentia to watch the\r\nresult of the struggle in Gallia Cisalpina; and a few days later came the\r\nnews of the victory of Forum Gallorum, which changed this unreasonable\r\npanic into an exultation almost as unreasonable.[124]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Forum Gallorum, April 15th, B.C. 43.]\r\n\r\nPansa was expected to reach the seat of war about the 16th of April.\r\nA detachment, consisting of the Martia and two pr\xc3\xa6torian cohorts, was\r\nsent out to conduct him and his four new legions into camp. In order to\r\nintercept this force Antony concealed two legions in Forum Gallorum,\r\nonly allowing his cavalry and light armed to be seen. On the 14th Pansa\r\nencamped near Bononia, and next morning started to join Hirtius in his\r\ncamp near Mutina, along with the troops sent out to meet him. The main\r\nforce marched over the open country; the two pr\xc3\xa6torian cohorts kept to\r\nthe _via \xc3\x86milia_. Near Forum Gallorum there was some marshy and difficult\r\nground. The Martia got through this first, and suddenly sighted Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncavalry. The men could not be held back: enraged at the recollection of\r\ntheir comrades executed at Brundisium, they broke into a charge. Pansa,\r\nunable to stop them, tried to bring up two new legions to their support.\r\nBut Antony was too quick for him. He suddenly led out his legions from\r\nthe village, and Pansa, in danger of being surrounded, had to retire upon\r\nhis camp of the previous night, having himself received two wounds,\r\nwhile the pr\xc3\xa6torian cohorts on the \xc3\x86milian road were cut to pieces.\r\nAntony seemed to have won the day. But he attempted too much. He pushed\r\non towards Bononia, hoping to storm the camp, but was beaten off and\r\nforced to retire to his own quarters near Mutina. He was, however, many\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 march from them. His men were tired, and when they reached Forum\r\nGallorum again they were met by Hirtius, who, having heard of Pansa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisaster, had come out with twenty veteran cohorts. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s wearied men\r\nwere utterly routed almost on the ground of their morning\xe2\x80\x99s victory, and\r\nhe had to escape with his cavalry to his camp near Mutina, which he did\r\nnot reach till long after sunset. Hirtius had no cavalry to pursue him,\r\nand accordingly went on to visit the wounded Pansa.\r\n\r\nThough the pr\xc3\xa6torian cohorts which had suffered so severely on the road\r\nwere Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s, he was not leading them, nor does he seem to have been\r\nengaged in either of the battles. But it appears that some of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen had threatened the camp in charge of which he had been left, and that\r\nhis success in repelling this attack was sufficiently marked for his\r\nsoldiers to greet him with the title of Imperator as well as Hirtius and\r\nPansa.[125]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony\xe2\x80\x99s second defeat at Mutina, 21 April.]\r\n\r\nThe news of this victory reached Rome on the 20th, and the extravagant\r\nexultation of the Ciceronians may be gathered from the Fourteenth\r\nPhilippic. But Antony was still investing Mutina, and though he had lost\r\nheavily, so also had his opponents, especially the Martia and Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npr\xc3\xa6torian cohorts. Pansa, disabled by his wounds, had been carried to\r\nBononia, and for some days nothing of importance was attempted. But on\r\nthe 21st Hirtius and Octavian moved to the west of Mutina, where the\r\nlines of investment were less complete, with the hope of relieving the\r\ntown on that side. Antony sent out his cavalry to intercept them, and,\r\nafter some skirmishing, two legions to support it. Octavian attacked\r\nand drove them back to their camp, into which Hirtius forced his way,\r\nbut was killed within the vallum. Octavian got possession of the body,\r\nbut had presently to evacuate the camp. Still Antony\xe2\x80\x99s losses in these\r\ntwo battles had been so severe that he feared being himself invested by\r\nOctavian, who would in that case, he felt sure, be joined by Lepidus and\r\nPlancus. Whatever might then be the fate of Decimus Brutus, he at any\r\nrate would be paralysed. He resolved to make a dash for the Transalpine\r\nprovince, hoping there to be joined not only by Pollio, Lepidus, and\r\nPlancus, but by Ventidius also. He accordingly raised the siege, and with\r\na strong body of cavalry marched along the _via \xc3\x86milia_. At Dertona he\r\nleft the road, and made the difficult pass of Aqu\xc3\xa6 Statiell\xc3\xa6, leading\r\nto the coast at Vada Sabatia. There he was joined by Ventidius, and\r\nproceeded along the Riviera into the province. Decimus Brutus did not\r\nstart in pursuit till the third day, partly owing to the exhausted state\r\nof his men after their long investment, partly because he wished to\r\ninduce Octavian to join him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The exultant Ciceronians slight Octavian.]\r\n\r\nThe news of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s retirement reached Rome on the 26th. The exultant\r\nCiceronians regarded the war as at an end, and next day, under Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence, Antony and his adherents were declared _hostes_ in the\r\nSenate.[126] He was believed to be utterly ruined, and the Senate was\r\nregarded as once more supreme. Decimus Brutus would of course cut to\r\npieces the poor remains of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s troops; Lepidus and Plancus would\r\nhold their provinces in obedience to the Senate. Octavian was no longer\r\nnecessary, and was immediately made to feel it. Not only were scandalous\r\nrumours spread abroad, charging him with causing the death of Hirtius,\r\nand suborning his physician to poison the wounds of Pansa,[127] but\r\nin the vote of thanks to the army no mention was made of him. The vote\r\nalso was so framed as to introduce divisions in the army itself by\r\nnaming certain cohorts for honour and passing over others; while the\r\nlegates conveying these thanks and honours were instructed to communicate\r\ndirectly with the men, not through Octavian as their commander. The\r\nlegions of Pansa were transferred to Decimus Brutus, even the Martia and\r\nQuarta, formerly commended for joining Octavian. At the same time, all\r\nthose most likely to be hostile to him were promoted. Sext. Pompeius was\r\ndeclared head of the naval forces of the republic; Brutus and Cassius\r\nwere confirmed in their provinces and given special powers in all other\r\nprovinces east of the Adriatic; a commission of ten was appointed to\r\nrevise the _acta_ of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s consulship, in which Octavian had no\r\nplace.[128] Lastly, his claim to a triumph and to be a candidate for one\r\nof the vacant consulships was rejected, though as a kind of sop he was\r\ngranted _consularia ornamenta_,[129] and Cicero appears to have proposed\r\nhis having an ovation.[130] But it was about the same time that Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunlucky epigram as to \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguishing and extinguishing\xe2\x80\x9d him was reported\r\nto Octavian.[131] If Cicero, who was in constant correspondence with\r\nhim, and was even discussing the possibilities of their holding the\r\nconsulship as colleagues,[132] could thus speak, what was he to think of\r\nthe rest? No doubt all these circumstances contributed to fix Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolve. He at once declined to co-operate with Decimus Brutus, or to\r\nsurrender his legions to him. Although those under Hirtius and Pansa\r\nhad been assigned bodily by the Senate to Brutus, the Martia and Quarta\r\nrefused to obey the order, and declared their loyalty to Octavian. Their\r\nexample was followed by the other veterans, who refused to serve under\r\nan assassin of their old imperator. Thus fortified, Octavian adopted\r\na line of conduct which partly alarmed and partly puzzled the other\r\ncommanders of troops. He established secret communications with Antony,\r\nreleasing prisoners taken from his army, and allowing certain officers\r\nto rejoin him; while he himself, remaining inactive for some months, was\r\nprivately preparing to enforce his claim on the consulship. The departure\r\nof Decimus Brutus left him in undisturbed command of the greater part of\r\nCisalpine Gaul, and there were no military forces between him and Rome,\r\nnow that Ventidius had accomplished his rapid march from Potentia to the\r\nwestern coast at Vada.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revulsion of feeling at Rome.]\r\n\r\nThe gradual disillusionment of the Ciceronians as to the victory over\r\nAntony; the perplexity caused by the inactivity of Octavian; the delays\r\nand helplessness of Decimus Brutus\xe2\x80\x94all these are faithfully reflected\r\nin the Cicero correspondence of this period. At first everything is\r\n_couleur-de-rose_. On the 21st of April, on the receipt of the news of\r\nthe battle of Forum Gallorum, he writes:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIn the youthful C\xc3\xa6sar there is a wonderful natural strain of\r\n    virtue. Pray heaven we may govern him in the flush of honours\r\n    and popularity as easily as we have held him up to this time!\r\n    This is certainly a more difficult thing, but nevertheless I\r\n    have no mistrust. For the young man has been convinced, and\r\n    chiefly by my arguments, that our safety is his work, and that,\r\n    at any rate, if he had not diverted Antony from the city, all\r\n    would have been lost.\xe2\x80\x9d[133]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th (after hearing of the fight at the camp) he thinks Octavian\r\nis with Decimus Brutus in pursuit of Antony or, as he says, \xe2\x80\x9cof the\r\nremnant of the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d[134]\r\n\r\nBut presently he is informed that Octavian is not thus acting, or serving\r\nthe interests of the Senate. Decimus Brutus writes from Dertona on the\r\n5th of May:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf C\xc3\xa6sar had hearkened to me and crossed the Apennines, I\r\n    should have reduced Antony to such straits that he would have\r\n    been ruined by failure of provisions rather than the sword. But\r\n    neither can any one control C\xc3\xa6sar, nor can C\xc3\xa6sar control his\r\n    own army\xe2\x80\x94both most disastrous facts.\xe2\x80\x9d[135]\r\n\r\nDecimus Brutus was inaccurately informed as to the relations between\r\nOctavian and his troops,[136] but was quite right in concluding that\r\nhe had no help to expect from him. He wrote again on the 12th of May,\r\nattributing his delay in beginning the pursuit to the fact that \xe2\x80\x9che could\r\nnot put any confidence in C\xc3\xa6sar without visiting and conversing with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d[137] He had, however, gained nothing by the interview, and had\r\nbeen specially dismayed to find that the Martia and Quarta refused to\r\njoin him.[138] On the 24th of May he writes again, warning Cicero that\r\nOctavian has heard of his epigram; that the veterans are indignant at\r\nthe proceedings in Rome; and that Octavian had secured all the troops\r\nlately commanded by Pansa.[139] Later in the same month he appears to\r\nhave suggested the recall of M. Brutus, and that meanwhile the defence of\r\nItaly should be intrusted to Octavian.[140]\r\n\r\nThis last suggestion shows how far he had failed to penetrate the policy\r\nof Octavian. The mistake was shared by L. Munatius Plancus, governor\r\nof Celtic Gaul, who was moving down towards the province expecting to\r\nbe joined by Octavian in opposing Antony, or, at any rate, supposing\r\nthat Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s army was at the disposal of the Senate. \xe2\x80\x9cLet C\xc3\xa6sar,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe says, on the 6th of June, \xe2\x80\x9ccome with the best troops he has, or, if\r\nanything prevents him from coming in person, let his army be sent.\xe2\x80\x9d[141]\r\nSome weeks later he too had learnt that C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s real purpose had been\r\nmisunderstood. He writes on the 28th of July:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI have never ceased importuning him by letter, and he has\r\n    uniformly replied that he is coming without delay, while all\r\n    the time I perceive that he has given up that idea, and has\r\n    taken up some other scheme. Nevertheless, I have sent our\r\n    friend Furnius to him with a message and a letter, in case he\r\n    may be able to do some good.\xe2\x80\x9d[142]\r\n\r\nWhile the generals in Gaul were thus being gradually brought to see that\r\nOctavian had an independent policy of his own, the hopes of support\r\nentertained by Cicero at home were one by one disappearing. By the middle\r\nof May he knew that Antony\xe2\x80\x99s retreat was not the disorganised flight\r\nsupposed, nor the end of the war.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe news which reached Rome,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, about the 15th of May,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cand what everybody believed, was that Antony had fled with\r\n    a small body of men, who were without arms, panic stricken,\r\n    and utterly demoralised. But if he is in such a position (as\r\n    Gr\xc3\xa6ceius tells us) that he cannot be offered battle without\r\n    risk, he appears to me not to have fled from Mutina, but merely\r\n    to have changed the seat of war. Accordingly there is a general\r\n    revulsion of feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d[143]\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances Cicero could do nothing but try to keep Decimus\r\nBrutus, Lepidus, and Plancus loyal to the Senate, and urge them to act\r\nwith vigour.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBe your own Senate,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes to Plancus about the 27th of\r\n    May, \xe2\x80\x9cand follow wherever the interests of the public service\r\n    shall lead you. Let it be your object that we hear of some\r\n    brilliant operation by you before we thought that it was going\r\n    to happen. I pledge you my word that whatever you achieve the\r\n    Senate will accept as having been done not only with loyal\r\n    intention, but with wisdom also.\xe2\x80\x9d[144]\r\n\r\nBut on the 29th of May Lepidus joined Antony.[145] On the 3rd of June\r\nDecimus Brutus writes for the last time in despairing tones to Cicero\r\nfrom near Grenoble,[146] and though a subsequent junction with Plancus\r\nkept him from destruction for a few weeks longer, he was never able to\r\ndo anything of any account again. The only hope remaining to Cicero was\r\nto induce M. Brutus or C. Cassius, or both, to come to Italy with their\r\narmies. He had not, indeed, quite given up hope of Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty,\r\nbut his old doubts were recurring, and though he still used flattering\r\nwords to him, he must have been conscious that Octavian had gauged their\r\nvalue. Late in June, writing to urge M. Brutus to come to Italy, he says:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe protecting force of the young C\xc3\xa6sar I regard as trustworthy; but so\r\nmany are trying to sap his loyalty that at times I am mortally afraid of\r\nhis giving in.\xe2\x80\x9d[147]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian, after some vain negotiations, at length moves on\r\nRome. Aug., B.C. 43.]\r\n\r\nIt does not seem true that Octavian yielded to the influence of others in\r\nthe steps which he now took. As at other times in his life he may have\r\nlistened to advice, but the final decision was always his own, adopted\r\nfrom passing sentiment or passion, but with the cool determination of\r\nsettled policy. He had decided that to be able to treat with Antony on\r\nequal terms he must obtain one of the vacant consulships. This would\r\nmake him legally head of the State, and add to his military strength\r\nthe prestige and authority of that position. If possible he would be\r\nelected without any show of force, and therefore began negotiations\r\nwith the Senate soon after the battles of Mutina through Cicero. But\r\nthe Senate suspected Cicero of wishing for the consulship himself, and\r\nwould not listen to the suggestion. The constitutional difficulty\r\nabout the election gave the Senate a decent excuse for postponement.\r\nBoth consuls were dead, and the pr\xc3\xa6tor was unable to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d a higher\r\nimperium than his own. There was no one to name a dictator, and as\r\nmagistrates with imperium still existed the _auspicia_ had not reverted\r\nto the _patres_, therefore they could not name _interreges_. On the 1st\r\nof January, when the curule offices would all be vacant, the _auspicia_\r\nwould revert to the Senate. Accordingly, after some discussion, Cicero\r\ntells a correspondent at the end of June, it had been held to be best,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin the interests of the constitution, to put off the elections till\r\nJanuary.\xe2\x80\x9d[148] But Octavian had no intention of being thwarted by this\r\ntechnical difficulty. He had no wish for the present to farther weaken\r\nAntony, and bring the whole weight of the Ciceronians upon himself, but\r\nhe was resolved that the consulship was necessary in order to be on\r\nan equal footing with him.[149] He therefore allowed a deputation of\r\nfour hundred of his soldiers to go to Rome to demand the payment of the\r\nbounties voted to them, with the understanding that they were also to\r\nask for the consulship for Octavian. There would be some show of reason\r\nin combining these two demands, for they needed his protection against\r\nthe decemvirs, who were likely to interfere in the allotment of lands\r\nmade both by Iulius and Antony. But the deputation, though admitted to\r\nthe curia, received an unfavourable answer. We are told that the Senate\r\ninsisted on their appearing unarmed, but that one of them left the Senate\r\nhouse and returned with a sword and the remark, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not give C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nthe consulship this will do so.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereupon Cicero exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that is\r\nyour way of pressing his suit, he will get it.\xe2\x80\x9d The same story is told\r\nof Iulius, and one is always suspicious of such dramatic scenes.[150] At\r\nany rate, Octavian regarded the attitude of the Senate as hostile, and\r\ndetermined to march on Rome with his eight legions,[151] a corresponding\r\nforce of cavalry, and some auxiliary troops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian enters Rome and obtains the consulship. August, B.C.\r\n43.]\r\n\r\nHe moved in two columns, the first consisting of his swiftest and most\r\nactive men, led by himself; for among other causes of anxiety was a\r\nfear that his mother and sister might meet with ill-treatment in Rome.\r\nThe Senate had no troops to oppose to this formidable army, and in its\r\nterror sent legates with the money promised to the men, but lately\r\nrefused to the deputation. Octavian however refused them entrance into\r\nthe camp, and pushed on without stopping. The panic in the city grew\r\ndaily more acute, and Cicero, who had pledged his credit for Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloyalty,[152] found himself an object of suspicion and retired from Rome.\r\nThen every concession was made in the Senate: the bounty promised to some\r\nof the troops was doubled, and extended to all the troops alike, though\r\nthe exchequer was exhausted by the payment of only two legions.[153]\r\nOctavian was to have the distribution of lands and rewards instead of the\r\ndecemvirs, and was allowed to be a candidate for the consulship in his\r\nabsence. Messengers were sent to announce these concessions to him; but\r\nhe had scarcely heard them when he was informed of a change of sentiment\r\nin Rome. The legions, summoned by the Senate from Africa, had arrived;\r\nCicero had reappeared; the decrees were rescinded; and measures were\r\nbeing taken to defend the city. The two legions from Africa were to be\r\nsupported by a levy _en masse_ and by a legion enrolled by Pansa but not\r\ntaken with him. The city pr\xc3\xa6tor M. Cornutus was to be commander-in-chief.\r\nAt the same time boats and other means of transport were being prepared\r\nin the Tiber for the escape of the chief citizens, their families and\r\nproperty, in case of defeat; while a vigorous search was being made for\r\nOctavian\xe2\x80\x99s mother and sister as hostages. Octavian felt that no time\r\nwas to be lost. Sending forward messengers to assure the people that\r\nthey would not be harmed,[154] he continued his advance on Rome. A day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarch from the city he was met by a large number of real or pretended\r\nsympathisers; and felt it safe to leave his troops and enter Rome with\r\na strong bodyguard. Enthusiastic crowds greeted his entrance, and as he\r\napproached the temple of Vesta he had the happiness of seeing his mother\r\nand sister, who had taken sanctuary with the Vestals, and now came out to\r\nembrace him. The three legions in Rome, in spite of some opposition from\r\ntheir officers, declared for him; and the pr\xc3\xa6tor Cornutus killed himself\r\nin despair. It was all over, and Octavian was master of the situation.\r\nFor a moment indeed there seemed a gleam of hope. A rumour reached the\r\ncity that the Martia and Quarta had refused to follow Octavian to Rome.\r\nCicero hastily gathered some partisans into the Senate house in the\r\nevening to discuss the possibility of further resistance. But while they\r\nwere in conference they learnt that the rumour was false. There was\r\nnothing for it but to disperse, and Cicero was fain to seek out Octavian\r\nand offer a tardy congratulation\xe2\x80\x94received with ironical courtesy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The consulship and other honours.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional difficulty as to the election was at once surmounted\r\nby the investment of two men with proconsular powers to hold it. The rest\r\nwas a mere form, and on the 19th of August Octavian, with his cousin\r\nQ. Pedius, entered upon their consulship. The now obsequious Senate\r\nproceeded to heap honours upon him. He was to have money to pay the\r\npromised bounties; to enjoy an imperium, when with an army, superior to\r\nthe consuls; to do whatever he thought necessary for the protection of\r\nthe city; and to take over the army lately assigned to Decimus Brutus.\r\nThe _lex curiata_ for his adoption under C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s will was at once\r\npassed, and he was now by right as well as by courtesy a C\xc3\xa6sar. His\r\ncolleague, Q. Pedius, at the same time carried a law for the trial of all\r\nconcerned in the murder of Iulius, and the _qu\xc3\xa6stio_ seems at once to\r\nhave been instituted. All were condemned in their absence and lost their\r\ncitizenship and the protection of the laws.[155] Brutus and Cassius, with\r\nthe rest of the assassins, were thus put at a great disadvantage. It was\r\nan act of war on their part, as condemned men, to hold their provinces or\r\ncommand troops. That the Senate, in which the majority were doubtless in\r\nfavour of Brutus and Cassius, should have practically sanctioned these\r\nmeasures,[156] shews how completely it was cowed. Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s position\r\nwas, in fact, a very strong one. It was not possible for M. Brutus to\r\ntransport a sufficient force from Macedonia to crush him, much less for\r\nCassius from Syria. The two combined would no doubt hope some day to be\r\nable to attack him; but meanwhile he had time to fortify himself by new\r\ncoalitions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Octavian goes to meet Antony.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x94as we should now call him\xe2\x80\x94only stayed in Rome to see these measures\r\nsecured. He then left the city under the care of Pedius, and marched\r\nonce more into Cisalpine Gaul. His nominal object was to destroy Decimus\r\nBrutus\xe2\x80\x94now a condemned man\xe2\x80\x94but his real purpose was to come to an\r\nunderstanding with Antony and Lepidus. Letters had already passed between\r\nthem, and some plan of action had been agreed upon. Antony was to crush\r\nDecimus Brutus and Plancus, while the Senate was persuaded by Pedius to\r\nrescind the decrees declaring Antony and Lepidus _hostes_. This news\r\nwas sent to C\xc3\xa6sar while on his leisurely march, and passed on by him to\r\nAntony; who thereupon proceeded to fulfil his part of the bargain. He was\r\nby this time, or shortly afterwards, reinforced by Asinius Pollio[157]\r\nwith two legions from Spain, who at once succeeded in securing the\r\ncohesion of Plancus. The greater part of the troops under Decimus Brutus\r\nalso insisted on following Plancus; and Brutus was obliged to fly with a\r\nsmall force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Decimus Brutus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The triumvirate arranged, Nov., B.C. 43.]\r\n\r\nThis settled the fate of Decimus Brutus, and left Northern Italy open to\r\nAntony, unless C\xc3\xa6sar still chose to oppose him. After various fruitless\r\nattempts to escape, Brutus was put to death by a Sequanian Gaul, under\r\norders from Antony,[158] who then with Pollio and Lepidus[159] marched\r\ninto Cispadane Gaul with a large part of their forces, the rest being\r\nleft to guard the province. The invading army marched along the \xc3\x86milian\r\nroad as though to attack C\xc3\xa6sar. But the real intention on both sides\r\nwas to come to terms. On an islet in a tributary of the Po, between\r\nMutina and Bononia, the three leaders, Antony, Lepidus, and C\xc3\xa6sar met\r\nfor conference, though not till elaborate precautions had been taken\r\nagainst treachery. For two days they sat from morning till night in\r\nearnest debate, in full view of their respective armies. On the third the\r\nsoldiers of both sides were summoned to a _contio_, and informed of the\r\narticles which had been agreed upon, though the last and most terrible\r\nof them\xe2\x80\x94the proscription\xe2\x80\x94was not communicated. The terms announced were:\r\n(1) C\xc3\xa6sar agreed to abdicate the consulship, which was to be held for\r\nthe remainder of the year by Ventidius Bassus; (2) Lepidus and Plancus\r\nwere to be consuls for B.C. 42; (3) Lepidus, C\xc3\xa6sar, and Antony were to be\r\nappointed by a _lex_ for the remainder of the year, and for five years\r\nfrom the next 1st of January, _triumviri reipublic\xc3\xa6 constituend\xc3\xa6_\xe2\x80\x94a board\r\nof three for settling the constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers of the Triumvirate.]\r\n\r\nThe Triumvirate was practically a dictatorship in commission. The word\r\nwas avoided owing to its prohibition in Antony\xe2\x80\x99s law. But the triumvirs\r\nwere to exercise all the powers of a dictator; their _acta_ were to be\r\nauthoritative; they were to be independent of the Senate; superior to\r\nall magistrates; to have the right of proposing laws to the _Comitia_;\r\nto regulate the appointment of magistrates and provincial governors. The\r\ncolleagueship was an apparent concession to the fundamental principle of\r\nthe constitution; but from the first it was practically a duumvirate\r\nrather than a triumvirate, Lepidus being treated almost at once as\r\ninferior. The Empire east of the Adriatic was for the moment separated\r\nfrom this home government, being held by Brutus and Cassius; but the\r\nwestern part was to be divided among the three\xe2\x80\x94C\xc3\xa6sar taking Africa,\r\nSardinia, and Sicily; Antony, Cisalpine Gaul and Transalpina, with the\r\nexception of Narbonensis; Lepidus, Gallia Narbonensis and Upper Spain. In\r\nthese districts each would be supreme and govern personally or by their\r\nlegates. But the greater part of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s share was still in the hands\r\nof Sextus Pompeius, and would have to be won back. It was accordingly\r\narranged that in the following year Lepidus, as consul, should be\r\nresponsible for the order of Italy, while C\xc3\xa6sar undertook to put down\r\nSextus, and Antony to confront M. Brutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of both armies, having no desire to fight each other,\r\nreceived the announcement with enthusiasm. Their devotion to Iulius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s memory was warmed by the belief that the anti-C\xc3\xa6sarean clique at\r\nRome meant to deprive them of the money and lands assigned to them. The\r\nTriumvirs, on the other hand, promised them allotments in the choicest\r\nparts of Italy\xe2\x80\x94Capua, Rhegium, Venusia, Vibo, Beneventum, Ariminum,\r\nNuceria. There was land at most of these places which from one cause or\r\nanother had become _ager publicus_; and when that failed there would\r\nalways be owners, whose part in the war just over, and that about to\r\ntake place, would give opportunity for confiscation. This combination of\r\nmilitary chiefs therefore suited the views and wishes of the soldiers,\r\nand some of them urged that the bond should be drawn still closer by\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s marriage with Antony\xe2\x80\x99s stepdaughter Clodia.[160] C\xc3\xa6sar assented\r\nto the betrothal, but as Clodia was still quite young, he prudently\r\ndeferred the marriage. He doubtless foresaw possible inconveniences in\r\nbeing too closely allied with Antony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Proscription.]\r\n\r\nThe next step was for the three to enter Rome and obtain a legal\r\nconfirmation of their appointment. But they did not wait till their\r\narrival in the city to begin the vengeance. They had agreed to follow the\r\nprecedent of Sulla by publishing lists of men declared to be out of the\r\npale of the law. The larger list was reserved for further consideration;\r\nbut a preliminary list of seventeen names was drawn up at once, and\r\nsoldiers were sent with orders to put the men to death wherever found.\r\nAmong these were Cicero, his brother, and nephew. Plutarch tells us that\r\nCicero\xe2\x80\x99s name was put upon the list as a compromise. Octavian bargained\r\nfor Lucius C\xc3\xa6sar, Antony\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, and in return conceded to Antony the\r\ninclusion of Cicero, while Lepidus consented to his brother, L. Paulus,\r\nbeing entered.[161] Four of the seventeen were found at once and put to\r\ndeath. Cicero escaped till the arrival of the triumvirs in Rome, but was\r\nkilled near Formi\xc3\xa6 on the 7th of December, his brother and nephew having\r\nalready been put to death in Rome. C\xc3\xa6sar was the first to arrive in the\r\ncity, and was quickly followed by Antony and Lepidus, each with a strong\r\npr\xc3\xa6torian guard. Their appointment was duly confirmed in the _Comitia_\r\non the proposal of the tribune Titus Titius, and on the 27th of November\r\nthey entered upon their office.[162]\r\n\r\nNaturally the sudden execution of three of the seventeen who were\r\nfound in Rome had created great alarm in the city, where no one knew\r\nwhose turn was to come next. The panic was somewhat lessened by Pedius\r\npublishing the list of the seventeen, with the assurance that no more\r\nexecutions were intended. He appears to have honestly believed this, but\r\nthe agitation of the night of horror was too much for him, and he died\r\nwithin the next twenty-four hours. On the day after the installation\r\nof the triumvirs (November 28th) the citizens were horrified to see an\r\nedict fixed up in the Forum, detailing the causes of the executions\r\nwhich were to follow, and offering a reward for the head of any one of\r\nthose named below\xe2\x80\x9425,000 sesterces to a freeman, 10,000 and freedom to a\r\nslave. All who aided or concealed a proscribed man were to suffer death\r\nthemselves. Below were two tablets, one for Senators and one for equites.\r\nThey contained 130 names, besides the original seventeen, to which were\r\nshortly added 150 more. Additions were continually being made during the\r\nfollowing days, either from private malice or covetousness. In some cases\r\nmen were first killed and then their names inserted in the lists. The\r\nedict made it the interest of slaves to betray their masters, against\r\nwhom perhaps in many cases these unfortunate men had a long list of\r\ninjuries to avenge. They had now the fierce gratification of seeing their\r\noppressors grovelling at their feet. But it also placed a severe strain\r\non the affection of the nearest kinsmen whose lives were forfeited if\r\nthey concealed or aided the proscribed. The sale of confiscated property\r\nat low rates gave opportunities for the covetous, and many a man perished\r\nbecause he possessed house or land desired by Fulvia or some friend of\r\nAntony. But though the terror revealed much meanness and treachery, it\r\nalso brought to light many instances of courage and devotion. Wives and\r\nsons risked death for husbands and fathers; and there were slaves who\r\nassumed the dress of their masters and died for them.\r\n\r\nThe massacre began with Salvius, though holding the sacrosanct office\r\nof tribune. Two pr\xc3\xa6tors\xe2\x80\x94Minucius and L. Velleius\xe2\x80\x94were cut down while\r\nengaged in their courts. To shew how no connections, however high, were\r\nto save any man, at the head of the list was a brother of Lepidus, an\r\nuncle of Antony, a brother of Plancus, and the father-in-law of Asinius\r\nPollio. But as usual in times of such horror, many perished who from\r\ntheir humble position or their youth could have had no share in politics.\r\nThe total number eventually proscribed, according to Appian, was \xe2\x80\x9cthree\r\nhundred Senators and about two thousand equites.\xe2\x80\x9d Livy says that there\r\nwere 130 names of Senators on the lists, and a large number (_plurimi_)\r\nof equites. Livy is probably giving the number of Senators who actually\r\nperished.[163] In Rome itself the terror was probably brief. It would not\r\ntake long to find those who stayed in the city; the gates and roads were\r\nstrictly guarded, and it was difficult to evade military vigilance. But\r\nmany were hiding in the country, and the search for them went on into\r\nthe first months of the next year, and all through Italy soldiers were\r\nscouring towns, villages, woods, and marshes in search of the proscribed.\r\nProbably the exact number of those executed was never known. But it seems\r\nlikely that about half escaped, some of whom in happier times rose to\r\nhigh office. There were three possible places of refuge, the camp of M.\r\nBrutus in Macedonia, of Cassius in Syria, and the fleet of Sext. Pompeius\r\nin Sicily. Pompeius sent vessels to cruise round the southern coasts of\r\nItaly and pick up refugees; and tried to counteract the edict by offering\r\nthose who saved any one of them double the sum set upon their heads by\r\nthe triumvirs. He was liberal in relieving their necessities, and found\r\ncommands or other employments for those of high rank.[164] At length,\r\nearly in B.C. 42 Lepidus informed the Senate that the proscriptions were\r\nat an end. He seems to have meant by this that no new list was to be\r\nissued, not that those already proscribed were to be pardoned; and C\xc3\xa6sar,\r\nwho was present, entered a protest against being bound even by this\r\ndeclaration.[165]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protest of Ladies.]\r\n\r\nIn fact another list was published, but this time it was of properties to\r\nbe confiscated, not of lives to be taken. In spite of the already large\r\nconfiscations the triumviral government was in financial difficulties.\r\nConfiscated properties were liable to reductions for the dowries of\r\nwidows, 10 per cent. to sons, and 5 per cent. to daughters.[166] These\r\nclaims were not always paid perhaps, but they sometimes were. Again,\r\nbesides the natural fall of prices caused by so much property coming\r\ninto the market at once, much of it was sold to friends and partisans at\r\ngreat reductions, few venturing to bid against men in power or soldiers.\r\nThe treasury, therefore, was not enriched as much as might have been\r\nexpected; and as the triumvirs had two wars in the immediate future to\r\nface, they were in great need of money. The tributum and tax on slaves\r\nwere reimposed, but failed to produce a surplus. A device therefore was\r\nhit upon something like the fines on \xe2\x80\x9cMalignants\xe2\x80\x9d in England, under the\r\nCommonwealth. Lists of persons more or less suspect were put up, who were\r\nordered to contribute a tenth of their property. Each man had to value\r\nhis own estate, and this gave rise to frequent accusations of fraud,\r\ngenerally resulting in the confiscation of the whole. Others found it\r\nimpossible to raise the money without selling property, which could only\r\nbe done just then at a ruinous sacrifice. An alternative was offered to\r\nsuch men which proved equally ruinous. They might surrender their whole\r\nestate and apply for the restoration of a third. The treasury was not\r\nlikely to be prompt in completing the transaction, for it had first to\r\nsell and satisfy charges on the estate, nor to take a liberal view of\r\nthe amount due to the owner. It was an encumbered estates act, under\r\nwhich the margin of salvage was always small, and tended to disappear\r\naltogether.[167] Among those thus proscribed were about fourteen hundred\r\nladies. They did not silently submit, but applied to Octavia, as well\r\nas to Antony\xe2\x80\x99s mother Iulia, and his wife Fulvia. By Octavia and Iulia\r\nthey were kindly received, but were driven from Fulvia\xe2\x80\x99s door. Undismayed\r\nthey appeared before the tribunal of the triumvirs, where Hortensia,\r\ndaughter of the orator Hortensius, pleaded their cause with something\r\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they were guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d she argued, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nought to have shared the fate of their relations. If not it was as\r\nunjust to injure their property as their persons. They had no share in\r\npolitical rights, and therefore were not liable to taxation. Women had\r\nof old voluntarily contributed their personal ornaments to the defences\r\nof the country; but they had never contributed, and, she hoped, never\r\nwould contribute to a civil war, or shew sympathy on either side.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ntriumvirs received the protest with anger, and ordered their lictors to\r\ndrive the ladies away. But they were struck by marks of disapproval among\r\nthe crowd; and next day a new edict was substituted, which contained\r\nonly four hundred names of women, and, instead of naming individual\r\nmen, imposed on all properties above 100,000 sesterces (about \xc2\xa3800) an\r\nimmediate tax of 2 per cent. of the capital, and one year\xe2\x80\x99s income for\r\nthe expenses of the war.[168]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Responsibility of Augustus for the proscriptions.]\r\n\r\nFor a just view of the character of Augustus, it is important to decide\r\nhow far he acquiesced in the cruelties of the proscription. With the\r\ngeneral policy he seems to have been in full accord; and as far as a\r\ncomplete vengeance on those implicated in the murder of Iulius was\r\nconcerned, he was no doubt inexorable. But his administration as sole\r\nhead of the state was so equitable and clement, that many found it\r\ndifficult to believe that he did more than tacitly acquiesce in the rest\r\nof the proscriptions. Augustus himself, in the memoir left to be engraved\r\nafter his death, omits all mention of them, and conveniently passes\r\nfrom the legal condemnation of the assassins to the assertion that he\r\nspared the survivors of Philippi. Paterculus only alludes to them in a\r\nsentence, which contains a skilful insinuation that Augustus only joined\r\nin them under compulsion. Appian makes no distinction between the three.\r\nHe tells us, indeed, some stories of mercy shown by Augustus, and of his\r\nexpressing approbation of acts of fidelity on the part of friends or\r\nslaves. But he also credits Antony with at least one act of a similar\r\nkind. Plutarch says that most blame was thought to attach to Antony, as\r\nbeing older than C\xc3\xa6sar and more influential than Lepidus. Dio goes more\r\nfully into the question. He affirms that Antony and Lepidus were chiefly\r\nresponsible for the proscriptions, pointing out that Octavian by his own\r\nnature, as well as his association with Iulius, was inclined to clemency;\r\nand moreover, that he had not been long enough engaged in politics to\r\nhave conceived many enmities, while his chief wish was to be esteemed and\r\npopular; and lastly, that when he got rid of these associates, and was in\r\nsole power, he was never guilty of such crimes. The strongest of these\r\narguments is that which claims for C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s youth immunity from widespread\r\nanimosities; and it does seem probable that outside the actual assassins\r\nand their immediate supporters, Augustus would not personally have cared\r\nto extend the use of the executioner\xe2\x80\x99s sword. But he cannot be acquitted\r\nof a somewhat cynical indifference to the cruelties perpetrated under\r\nthe joint name and authority of the triumvirs. None of them have been\r\ndirectly attributed to him, except perhaps in the case of his (apparently\r\nunfaithful) guardian Toranius; but neither is there any record of his\r\nhaving interfered to prevent them. Suetonius seems to give the truer\r\naccount, that he resisted the proscription at first, but, when it was\r\nonce decided upon, insisted that it should be carried out relentlessly.\r\nThe proscription was an odious crime; but a proscription that did not\r\nfulfil its purpose would have been a monstrous blunder also. I do not,\r\nhowever, admit Seneca\xe2\x80\x99s criticism that his subsequent clemency was merely\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccruelty worn out.\xe2\x80\x9d[169] The change was one of time and circumstance.\r\nYouth is apt to be hard-hearted. With happier surroundings and lengthened\r\nexperience his character and judgment ripened and mellowed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Atia.]\r\n\r\nWhile these horrors were just beginning C\xc3\xa6sar lost his mother Atia,\r\nthe tender and careful guide of his childhood and youth, the first of\r\nhis near kin to recognise and approve his high destiny. She died while\r\nhe was still consul, that is, between the 19th of August and the 27th\r\nof November, B.C. 43. Devoted to her in her life C\xc3\xa6sar now obtained for\r\nher the honours of a public funeral. During the campaign of Mutina she\r\nwas, it seems, at Rome; and when his estrangement from the Senate made\r\nher position unpleasant or dangerous, she had taken sanctuary with the\r\nVestal Virgins accompanied by Octavia, and was ready to greet him when\r\nhe returned to Rome. Nicolas of Damascus gives an attractive picture\r\nof Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s relations with his mother; and even the uncomplimentary\r\nSuetonius owns that his dutiful conduct to her had been exemplary.\r\nShe had brought up her son with strictness, and the author of the\r\n_de oratoribus_ classes her with the mother of the Gracchi. But her\r\nstrictness had not forfeited her son\xe2\x80\x99s affection, nor failed to impress\r\nupon him a high sense of duty. Her second husband Philippus survived her\r\nseveral years.[170]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPHILIPPI\r\n\r\n    _Cum fracta virtus, et minaces_\r\n    _turpe solum tetigere mento._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. Brutus and C. Cassius in the East.]\r\n\r\nThe first task of the Triumvirs, after securing their power at Rome, was\r\nthe restoration of unity and peace to the Empire, which was threatened\r\nat two points: Brutus and Cassius were in arms in the East, Sext.\r\nPompeius in the West. The opposition of Brutus and Cassius seemed the\r\nmore formidable of the two. Brutus, indeed, after holding Macedonia\r\nthroughout B.C. 43, after capturing and eventually putting to death Gaius\r\nAntonius, and after winning some laurels in contests with surrounding\r\nbarbarians, had towards the end of the year practically abandoned the\r\nprovince and removed to Asia, in which a decree of the Senate had given\r\nhim propr\xc3\xa6torial authority along with Cassius. But at Cyzicus and on\r\nthe coast of Bithynia he had collected a considerable fleet, and having\r\nthus strengthened himself and levied large sums of money, he sent urgent\r\nmessages to Cassius to join him in the defence of the republic.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cassius had done much towards securing the rest of the East to\r\ntheir cause. At the end of B.C. 44 he had entered Palestine, and been\r\njoined successively by the forces of L. Statius Murcus, proconsul of\r\nSyria; of M. Crispus, proconsul of Bithynia; of C\xc3\xa6cilius Bassus, the old\r\nPompeian officer who had seduced the troops of Sextius Iulius from their\r\nallegiance; and by four legions from Egypt under Aulus Allienus, whom\r\nDolabella had sent to bring them to himself. With twelve legions he had\r\nshut up Dolabella at Laodicea-ad-Mare, aided by a fleet raised in part by\r\nLentulus, the proqu\xc3\xa6stor of Asia, and had eventually terrified him into\r\nsuicide. He had himself also, or by his legates, collected a fleet strong\r\nenough to prevent Cleopatra sending aid to Antony and Octavian, while\r\npart of it, under Statius Murcus and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was to\r\nwatch the harbour of Brundisium and prevent the despatch of troops from\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of B.C. 42, therefore, when Brutus and Cassius met at\r\nSmyrna they were both in possession of formidable forces, naval and\r\nmilitary, and Cassius at any rate was also well supplied with money. They\r\ndid not, however, at once push on to Macedonia, for they believed that\r\nthe danger threatened by Sext. Pompeius would delay the advance of the\r\nTriumvirs. They therefore spent some months in farther securing the East.\r\nBrutus proceeded to reduce the cities in Lycia, Cassius sailed against\r\nRhodes, while one of his legates invaded Cappadocia, and defeated and\r\nkilled King Ariobarzanes. Both encountered some resistance, but when they\r\nmet again in the summer at Sardis they had successfully carried out their\r\nobjects; and Cassius had refilled his exchequer by the taxes of Asia, the\r\ntowns in which had been compelled to pay nearly ten years\xe2\x80\x99 revenue in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nHaving told off a portion of his fleet to keep up the watch over\r\nCleopatra and at Brundisium, the two proconsuls set out together for\r\nAbydos, and thence crossed to Europe. They marched along the coast road,\r\nformerly traversed by Persian invaders, their fleet also, like that of\r\nthe Persian king of old, coasting along parallel with their march, till\r\nthey came to the part of the Pang\xc3\xa6an range which covers the ten miles\r\nbetween Philippi and its harbour Neapolis (Datum). There they found the\r\nroad blocked by Gaius Norbanus and Decidius Saxa, with eight legions,\r\nsent in advance by Antony. When they left the main road and attempted\r\nto pass nearer Philippi they found the heights immediately south of the\r\ntown also guarded. They drove off the enemy and encamped on two hills\r\nwhich they connected by a trench and stockade; and eventually farther\r\nsecured their position by occupying a line of hills commanding the road\r\nto the sea. They thus kept up communication with the fleet at Thasos as a\r\nbase of supplies. Norbanus and Saxa did not venture to attack them, but\r\nretired upon Amphipolis, and thence sent intelligence to Rome, meanwhile\r\nkeeping the enemy in check by skirmishing parties of cavalry. Brutus and\r\nCassius were in no hurry to advance, for they had an excellent position,\r\nand were sure of supplies while in touch with their fleet; whereas their\r\nopponents depended on the country, which was neither rich nor well\r\nstocked. The fleet of Murcus and Domitius might also delay, and perhaps\r\nprevent Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar from bringing reinforcements, while the fleet at\r\nThasos could stop supplies being conveyed by sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The difficulties of Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar with Sextus Pompeius.]\r\n\r\nNor were these the only difficulties in the way of the Triumvirs. Ever\r\nsince the battle of Munda (B.C. 45) Sextus Pompeius had been leading\r\na piratical life in the Western Mediterranean. His forces had been\r\ncontinually increased by fugitive Pompeians and by natives from Africa,\r\nuntil he had become possessed of a formidable power against which the\r\nsuccessive governors of Southern Spain had been able to effect little.\r\nAfter the death of Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar an attempt was made through Lepidus to\r\ncome to terms with him, and he had agreed to submit to the government on\r\ncondition of a _restitutio in integrum_, including the restoration of\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s property. But though Antony obtained a confirmation from\r\nthe Senate the arrangement was never carried out. Probably the immense\r\nsum named as the value of the property\xe2\x80\x94about five millions sterling\xe2\x80\x94made\r\nit impossible, especially when the money in the temple of Ops had been\r\nsquandered. Moreover Pompeius seems to have demanded the actual house\r\nand estates of his father, and these were in Antony\xe2\x80\x99s hands, who would\r\nnot easily surrender them. Sextus therefore stayed in Spain or with his\r\nfleet. When the Senate broke with Antony it renewed negotiations with\r\nSextus, promised him the satisfaction of his claims, passed a vote of\r\nthanks to him for services, and confirmed him in his command of all\r\nRoman ships on active service.[171] The Triumvirs deposed him from this\r\ncommand, and put his name on the proscription list. His answer was to\r\nsail to Sicily, force Pompeius Bithynicus to surrender Messana, and take\r\npossession of the island. Here he was joined by numerous refugees of the\r\nproscribed and many skilful seamen from Africa and elsewhere. By thus\r\nholding Sicily and Sardinia he could do much towards starving out Italy,\r\nupon the southern shores of which he also made frequent descents. He\r\nacted as an independent ruler, and presently put Bithynicus to death on a\r\ncharge of plotting against him.[172]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The campaign of Philippi.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar and Antony suspected Lepidus of keeping up communication with\r\nPompeius, and consequently he was practically shelved. He was to remain\r\nat Rome to keep order and carry out formal duties, while Antony was to\r\ntransport his legions from Brundisium to attack Brutus and Cassius, and\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was to conduct the war against Sextus Pompeius. But the strength\r\nof Pompeius seems not to have been fully realised. C\xc3\xa6sar despatched a\r\nfleet under Q. Salvidienus to Sicily, while he himself went by land\r\nto Rhegium. But Salvidienus was badly defeated by Pompeius and had to\r\nretire to the Italian shore to refit,[173] and before C\xc3\xa6sar had time\r\nto do anything more he was called to the aid of Antony, who was in\r\ndifficulties at Brundisium, the exit of the harbour being blocked by the\r\nships of Statius Murcus, presently reinforced by those of Ahenobarbus.\r\nThe arrival of C\xc3\xa6sar and his fleet enabled the transports to cross,\r\nand Antony marched along the Egnatian Way to join his advanced army at\r\nAmphipolis. C\xc3\xa6sar was once more attacked by illness and obliged to stay\r\nat Dyrrachium; but hearing that Antony, on his arrival, had suffered\r\nsome reverses in cavalry skirmishes, he resolved to join him at all\r\nhazards. It was indeed a crisis of the utmost importance to him. He was\r\nleaving Italy exposed to a double danger, on the east from Murcus and\r\nAhenobarbus, on the south from Sextus Pompeius. If Antony were defeated\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar would be in a most alarming position; if Antony won without him,\r\nhis own prestige would be damaged and he might have to take a second\r\nplace in the joint government. As before in the Spanish journey his\r\nresolution conquered physical weakness, and he reached the seat of war\r\nbefore any general engagement had taken place. He found the army somewhat\r\ndiscouraged. Antony had left his heavy baggage at Amphipolis, which had\r\nbeen secured by Decidius and Norbanus, and had advanced over the wide\r\nplain (about sixty miles) to within a mile of the high ground on which\r\nBrutus and Cassius were entrenched. But they were too strongly posted to\r\nbe attacked, and he had suffered some losses in his attempts to draw them\r\ndown. His men were getting demoralised by the evidently superior position\r\nof the enemy, who were protected on the right by mountains, and on their\r\nleft by a marsh stretching between them and the sea, so that it was\r\nimpossible to turn their position on either side. Delay was all in favour\r\nof Brutus and Cassius, whose fleet afforded abundant provisions, while\r\nAntony would have great difficulty in feeding his army during the winter,\r\nand the season was already advanced. In mere numbers there was not much\r\ndifference. Both had nineteen legions; and, though those of Brutus were\r\nnot at their full strength, he and Cassius had 20,000 cavalry, as against\r\n13,000 of Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First battle at Philippi.]\r\n\r\nThe first battle (late in October) was brought on by an attempt of\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s to get across the marsh by a causeway which he had himself\r\nconstructed, and storm an earthwork which Cassius had thrown up to\r\nprevent him. Repulsing a flank attack made by the division of Brutus, he\r\ncarried the earthwork and even took the camp of Cassius, who with his\r\nmain body retired to the heights nearer Philippi with heavy loss. But\r\nAntony had also suffered severely, and the fate of the day could not be\r\nconsidered decided until it was known how Brutus had fared, who after\r\nthe unsuccessful attack on Antony\xe2\x80\x99s flank, had attacked C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s division\r\nwhich was opposite him. In this last movement he had been entirely\r\nsuccessful. C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s camp had been stormed and his men driven into flight,\r\nhe himself being absent through illness. The result of this cross victory\r\nwas that both armies returned to their original positions. Antony,\r\nfinding that the left wing was defeated, did not venture to remain in the\r\ncamp of Cassius. Cassius might have returned to it, but for a mistake\r\nwhich cost him his life. He was wrongly informed that Brutus had been\r\ndefeated, and being short-sighted he mistook a squadron of cavalry that\r\nwas riding up to announce Brutus\xe2\x80\x99s success for enemies, and anticipated\r\nwhat he supposed to be inevitable capture by suicide. Brutus, informed\r\nof this, withdrew his men from the attack on C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s camp, and retired\r\nbehind their lines, occupying again Cassius\xe2\x80\x99s abandoned quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second battle at Philippi, November.]\r\n\r\nNearly at the same time as this indecisive battle the cause of the\r\ntriumvirs had suffered a disaster nearer home. A fleet of transports\r\nconveying the Martia, another legion, and some cavalry was destroyed by\r\nMurcus and Ahenobarbus, and the greater part of the men had been lost at\r\nsea or forced to surrender. Though Brutus did not yet know this he held\r\nhis position for about a fortnight longer. But the tidings when they\r\ncame made it more than ever necessary for Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar to strike a\r\nblow; for they were still more isolated than before and more entirely\r\ncut off from supplies. On the other hand, the officers and men in the\r\narmy of Brutus were inspired by it with an eager desire to follow up\r\nthe good news by fighting a decisive battle. Brutus yielded against his\r\nbetter judgment and drew out his men. Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar did the same. But\r\nit was not until the afternoon was well advanced that the real fighting\r\nbegan. After spending more time than usual in hurling volleys of pila\r\nand stones, they drew their swords and grappled in a furious struggle at\r\nclose quarters. Both Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar were active in bringing up fresh\r\ncompanies to fill up gaps made by the fallen. At last the part of the\r\nline against which C\xc3\xa6sar was engaged began to give way, retiring step by\r\nstep, and fighting desperately all the while. But the order grew looser\r\nand looser, until at length it broke into downright flight. The camp\r\nof Brutus was stormed and his whole army scattered. C\xc3\xa6sar was left to\r\nguard the captured camp, while Antony (as at Pharsalia) led the cavalry\r\nin pursuit. He ordered his men to single out officers for slaughter or\r\ncapture, lest they should rally their men and make a farther stand. He\r\nwas particularly anxious to capture Brutus, perhaps as hoping to avenge\r\nhis brother. But in this his men were foiled by a certain Lucilius, who\r\nthrew himself in their way professing to be Brutus, and the mistake\r\nwas not discovered till he was brought to Antony. Brutus had, in fact,\r\nescaped to high ground with four legions. He hoped with this force to\r\nrecapture his camp and continue the policy of wearing out the enemy by\r\ndelay. But a good look-out was maintained by Antony during the night, and\r\nthe next morning his officers told Brutus that they would fight no more,\r\nbut were resolved to try to save their lives by making terms with the\r\nvictors. Exclaiming that he was then of no farther use to his country,\r\nBrutus called on his freedman Strato to kill him, which he immediately\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conduct of C\xc3\xa6sar after the victory.]\r\n\r\nThere is some conflict of testimony as to the severitie inflicted after\r\nthe victory. The bulk of the survivors with their officers submitted\r\nand were divided between the armies of the two triumvirs. A certain\r\nnumber who had been connected with the assassination and included in\r\nthe proscription lists felt that they had no mercy to expect, and saved\r\nfarther trouble by putting an end to their own lives. But some also, as\r\nFavonius the Stoic, imitator of Cato, were executed. Suetonius attributes\r\nto C\xc3\xa6sar not only special severity, but cruel and heartless insults to\r\nthose whom he condemned. To one man begging for burial he answered that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat would be business of the birds.\xe2\x80\x9d A father and son begging their\r\nlives he bade play at _morra_ for the privilege of surviving. And he\r\nordered the head of Brutus to be sent home that it might be placed at\r\nthe foot of Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s statue. As usual there remain some doubts as\r\nto these stories. That of the father and son, for instance, is related\r\nby Dio, but placed after Actium.[174] And the story as to the head of\r\nBrutus is somewhat inconsistent with the honourable treatment of the\r\nbody attributed to Antony.[175] The refusal of funeral rites is contrary\r\nto his own assertion in his autobiography; and, in the _Monumentum\r\nAncyranum_, he declares that he \xe2\x80\x9cspared all citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d[176] But it must\r\nbe conceded that until the assassins and their supporters were finally\r\ndisposed of he shewed himself relentless. The milder sentiments are those\r\nof a later time. The plea of a duty to avenge his \xe2\x80\x9cfather\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d murder may\r\nmitigate, but cannot annul, his condemnation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second division of the Empire, B.C. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe victory of Philippi reunited the eastern and western parts of the\r\nEmpire, and therefore necessitated a fresh distribution of spheres of\r\ninfluence among the triumvirs. The new agreement was reduced to writing\r\nand properly attested, partly that C\xc3\xa6sar might silence opposition at\r\nRome, but partly also because the two men had already begun to feel some\r\nof their old distrust of each other. During the late campaign, when there\r\nseemed some chance of defeat, Antony had expressed regret at having\r\nembarrassed himself with C\xc3\xa6sar instead of making terms with Brutus and\r\nCassius, and such words, however hasty or petulant, would be sure to\r\nreach C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s ears. The respect also shewn by Antony to the remains of\r\nBrutus, and the evident tendency of the defeated party to prefer union\r\nwith him rather than with C\xc3\xa6sar, as well as the more generous terms which\r\nhe was willing to grant, must all have suggested to C\xc3\xa6sar the precarious\r\nnature of the tie between them. It was necessary therefore to put the\r\narrangement now made beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nThe division did not, as two years later, distinguish between East and\r\nWest. It was still only the western half of the Empire which was to be\r\ndivided. Italy was to be treated as the centre of government, open to all\r\nthe triumvirs alike for recruiting and other purposes. The provinces were\r\nto be administered in the usual way by governors approved of by them,\r\nexcept that Antony was to have Gaul and Africa, C\xc3\xa6sar Spain and Numidia,\r\nthus securing to each a government in the west and south roughly equal\r\nin extent and in importance, now that Sicily and Sardinia were in the\r\nhands of Sextus Pompeius and thus actually hostile to Italy. But the last\r\narticle in the agreement, though intended to provide only for a passing\r\nstate of affairs, did in fact foreshadow the division of the Empire into\r\nEast and West. By it Antony undertook to go at once to Asia to crush\r\nthe fragments of the republican party still in arms in the East, and to\r\ncollect money sufficient for the payment of the promised rewards to the\r\nveterans. C\xc3\xa6sar, on the other hand, was to return to Italy to carry on\r\nthe war against Sextus Pompeius and arrange the assignation of lands.\r\nLepidus was still consul as well as triumvir, but if the suspicion of his\r\nbeing in correspondence with Pompeius was confirmed he was to have no\r\nprovince and was to be suppressed by C\xc3\xa6sar. If it did not turn out to\r\nbe true Antony undertook to hand over Africa to him. He was throughout\r\ntreated as subordinate\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9ca slight, unmeritable man,\r\n    Meet to be sent on errands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe real governors of the Empire were to be Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar. The force\r\nof circumstances ordained that for the next ten years Antony was to\r\ngovern the East and C\xc3\xa6sar the West. And as yet the heart and life of\r\nthe Empire was in the west. It was this, as much as the difference of\r\nhis character, which eventually secured to C\xc3\xa6sar the advantage over his\r\ncolleague and made him master of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPERUSIA AND SICILY\r\n\r\n    _actus cum freto Neptunius_\r\n    _dux fugit ustis navibus._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustus returns to Rome after Philippi, early in B.C. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign which ended with the second battle at Philippi and the\r\ndeath of Brutus had been won at the cost of much physical suffering to\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, who only completed his twenty-first year some days after it. He\r\nhad been in bad health throughout, barely able to endure the journey\r\nacross Macedonia, and only performing his military duties with the utmost\r\ndifficulty and with frequent interruptions. On his return journey he had\r\nto halt so often from the same cause that reports of his death reached\r\nRome. The slowness with which he travelled also gave time for all kinds\r\nof rumours to spread abroad as to farther severities to be exercised upon\r\nthe republican party on his return, and many of those who felt that they\r\nwere open to suspicion sought places of concealment for themselves or\r\ntheir property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 41 Consuls L. Antonius Pietas, Serv. Vatia Isauricus II.\r\nAllotting lands for the veterans.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar sent reassuring messages to Rome, but he did not arrive in the city\r\ntill the beginning of the next year (B.C. 41). He found Lucius Antonius\r\nconsul, who had celebrated a triumph on the first day of the year for\r\nsome trifling successes in Gaul. The real control of affairs, however,\r\nwas being exercised by Fulvia, the masculine wife of Marcus Antonius,\r\nwidow successively of Clodius and Curio, against whom Lepidus had been\r\nafraid or unable to act. Fulvia and Lucius professed to be safeguarding\r\nthe interests of Marcus and fulfilling his wishes, and Lucius adopted the\r\ncognomen _Pietas_ as a sign of his fraternal devotion. But the moving\r\nspirit throughout was Fulvia. C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s first business in Rome was the\r\nallotment of land to the veterans. This had been begun a year before in\r\nTranspadane Gaul, on the establishment of the Triumvirate, by Asinius\r\nPollio, left in command of that district; and Vergil has given us some\r\ninsight into the bitterness of feeling which it often roused:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cShall some rude soldier hold these new ploughed lands?\r\n    Some alien reap the labours of our hands?\r\n    Ah, civil strife, what fruit your jangling yields!\r\n    Poor toilsome souls\xe2\x80\x94for these we sowed our fields!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen there was public land available for the purpose, the allotment could\r\ngenerally be made without much friction; but as there was not enough of\r\nit, the old precedent of \xe2\x80\x9ccolonisation\xe2\x80\x9d was followed. A number of Italian\r\ntowns (nineteen in all) were selected, in the territories of which the\r\nveterans of a particular legion were to be settled as _coloni_, with a\r\nthird of the land assigned for their support. No doubt in each case the\r\nlands held by men who had served in the opposite camp were first taken as\r\nbeing lawfully confiscated; but it must often have happened that there\r\nwas not enough of such lands, and that those of persons not implicated\r\nin the civil wars were seized wholly or in part. In such cases it was\r\nunderstood that the owners were to be compensated by money arising from\r\nthe sale of other confiscations. But this money was either insufficient\r\nor long in coming. Petitions and deputations remonstrating against the\r\ninjustice poured in upon C\xc3\xa6sar, who, on the other hand, had to listen to\r\nmany complaints from the veterans of inadequate provision made for them\r\nand of promises still unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: L. Antonius and Fulvia take advantage of the discontent.]\r\n\r\nThis was a sufficiently thorny task in itself. But it was made still\r\nmore irksome by L. Antonius and Fulvia. Their pretext was that the\r\nveterans in Antony\xe2\x80\x99s legions were less liberally treated than those\r\nin C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s own; and Lucius claimed, as consul and as representing his\r\nbrother, the right of settling the allotments of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s veterans. C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nretorted by complaining that the two legions to which he was entitled\r\nby his written agreement with Antony had not been handed over to him.\r\nStarting from these counter charges they were soon at open enmity,\r\nembittered by the frequent collision between the constitutional authority\r\nof the consul and the extra-constitutional _imperium_ of the triumvir.\r\nLucius and Fulvia made capital out of this, maintaining that Marcus was\r\nready to lay down his extraordinary powers as triumvir, and to return to\r\nRome as consul. Fulvia was credited with a more personal motive. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfatuation for Cleopatra was becoming known in Rome, and it was believed\r\nthat Fulvia designedly promoted civil troubles in the hope of inducing\r\nher husband to return.[177] At any rate she and Lucius took advantage\r\nof the ill-feeling against C\xc3\xa6sar caused by the confiscation of land.\r\nThey feigned to plead for the dispossessed owners, maintaining that the\r\nconfiscations had already produced enough for the payment of all claims,\r\nand that, if it were found that this was not so, Marcus would bring home\r\nfrom Asia what would cover the balance. They thus made C\xc3\xa6sar unpopular\r\nwith both sides\xe2\x80\x94with the veterans who thought that he might have\r\nsatisfied their claims in full; with the dispossessed owners, who, over\r\nand above the natural irritation at their loss, thought that his measure\r\nhad not been even necessary, and that he might have paid the veterans\r\nwithout mulcting them, or might have waited for the money from Asia.\r\nSpecially formidable was the anger of landowners who were in the Senate.\r\nThe discontent was increased by the hardness of the times; for corn\r\nwas at famine price owing to Sextus Pompeius and Domitius Ahenobarbus\r\ninfesting the Sicilian and Ionian seas. C\xc3\xa6sar was therefore in a serious\r\ndifficulty. Unable to satisfy veterans and Senators at the same time, he\r\nfound how powerless is mere military force against widespread and just\r\nresentment. His one answer to senatorial remonstrance had been, \xe2\x80\x9cBut how\r\nam I to pay the veterans?\xe2\x80\x9d Now, however, he found it necessary to let\r\nalone the properties of Senators, the dowries of women, and all holdings\r\nless than the share of a single veteran. This again led to mutinies\r\namong the troops, who murdered some of their tribunes, and were within\r\na little of assassinating C\xc3\xa6sar himself. They were only quieted by the\r\npromise that all their relations, and all fathers and sons of those who\r\nhad fallen in the war, should retain lands assigned to them. This again\r\nenraged a number of the losers, and fatal encounters between owners and\r\nintruding \xe2\x80\x9ccolonists\xe2\x80\x9d became frequent. The soldiers had the advantage of\r\ntraining, but the inhabitants were more numerous, and attacked them with\r\nstones and tiles from the housetops, both in Rome and the country towns.\r\nThe burning of houses became so common that it was found necessary to\r\nremit a whole year\xe2\x80\x99s rent of houses let for 500 denarii (\xc2\xa320) and under\r\nin the city, and a fourth part in the rest of Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other provocations offered to Augustus. He takes steps to\r\nprotect himself.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was also made to feel that attachment to Antony meant hostility to\r\nhimself; for two legions despatched by him to Spain were refused passage\r\nthrough the province by Q. Fufius Calenus and Ventidius Bassus, Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegates in Gallia Transalpina.[178] Alarmed by the aspect of affairs,\r\nhe tried to come to some understanding with Lucius and Fulvia, but\r\nfound them resolutely hostile. The mediation of officers in the army,\r\nof private friends and Senators proved of no avail; though he produced\r\nthe agreement drawn up between Marcus and himself, and offered to allow\r\nthe Senate to arbitrate on their disputes. Satisfied that by the refusal\r\nof this offer Lucius and Fulvia had put themselves in the wrong, he\r\ndetermined to rely upon his army. For Lucius had been collecting men\r\namong those offended by C\xc3\xa6sar, and Fulvia, accompanied by many Senators\r\nand equites, had occupied Pr\xc3\xa6neste with a body of troops, to which she\r\nregularly gave the watchword as their commander, appeared among them\r\nwearing a sword, and frequently harangued the men.\r\n\r\nThe men of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s army, no doubt acting on a hint from himself, now\r\ntook the matter into their own hands. They suddenly entered Rome,\r\naffirming that they wished to consult the Senate and people. Assembling\r\non the Capitol, with such citizens as ventured to come, they ordered the\r\nagreement between C\xc3\xa6sar and Antony to be read, voted its confirmation,\r\nconstituted themselves judges between the disputants, and named a day\r\non which Fulvia, Lucius, and C\xc3\xa6sar were to appear before them at Gabii.\r\nHaving ordered these resolutions to be written out and deposited with\r\nthe Vestals, they peaceably dispersed. C\xc3\xa6sar was present and of course\r\nconsented to appear; but Lucius and Fulvia, though at first promising\r\nto attend at Gabii, did not do so. They scoffed at the idea of a mob\r\nof soldiers, a _senatus caligatus_[179] (a \xe2\x80\x9cTommy-Atkins-parliament\xe2\x80\x9d),\r\npresuming to speak for Senate and people. They were therefore voted in\r\ntheir absence to be in the wrong, and C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s _acta_ were confirmed.\r\nThe show of legality thus gained for him was used by his officers to\r\njustify the collection of money in all directions. Temples were stripped\r\nof silver ornaments to be coined into money, and troops were summoned\r\nfrom Cisalpine Gaul, which in spite of the claims of Marcus Antonius,\r\nwas now made a part of Italy without a provincial governor having a\r\nright to maintain troops.[180] Lucius also, as consul, enrolled men\r\nwherever his authority was acknowledged, and once more there was civil\r\nwar in Italy. It was in many respects a recrudescence of the republican\r\nopposition lately headed by Brutus and Cassius. For Sextus Pompeius had\r\nbeen joined by Murcus with vessels carrying two legions and 500 archers,\r\nand was reinforced with the remains of the armies of Brutus and Cassius,\r\nwhich had taken refuge in Cephallenia. In Africa Antony\xe2\x80\x99s legate, Titus\r\nSextius, though he had surrendered the province to C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s legate\r\nLurco, had resumed possession and put Lurco to death. Lastly, Domitius\r\nAhenobarbus was threatening Brundisium with seventy ships. It was not\r\nclear how far these movements were known or approved by Antony; but the\r\nold republican party hoped that their upshot would be the dissolution of\r\nthe triumvirate, the downfall of C\xc3\xa6sar, and the restoration of the old\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Open war between Augustus and L. Antonius B.C. 41-40.]\r\n\r\nFor the present C\xc3\xa6sar left Sextus Pompeius alone. But he sent a legion\r\nto Brundisium and summoned Salvidienus with his six legions from his\r\nmarch into Spain. Salvidienus had been opposed by Antony\xe2\x80\x99s legates\r\nPollio and Ventidius, and was now harassed in his rear by them when he\r\nturned homeward along the _via Cassia_. Open hostilities, however, began\r\nelsewhere. Some legions at Alba Fucensis showed signs of mutiny, and both\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar and Antonius started for Alba, hoping to secure their adhesion.\r\nBut Antonius got there first, and by lavish promises won them to his\r\nside. C\xc3\xa6sar only came in time to skirmish with Antonius\xe2\x80\x99s rearguard under\r\nC. Furnius, and then moved northward to renew his attack on Furnius,\r\nwho had retreated to Sentinum in Umbria. On his way he unsuccessfully\r\nattacked Nursia, where Antonius had a garrison, and while he was thus\r\nengaged Antonius himself led his main army to Rome. Such troops as C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nhad left in or near the city surrendered to him; while Lepidus, without\r\nattempting resistance, fled to C\xc3\xa6sar,[181] and the other consul made no\r\nopposition. Lucius summoned a _contio_, declared that he meant to depose\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar and Lepidus from their unconstitutional office, and to re-establish\r\nthe just authority of the consulship, with which his brother Marcus would\r\nbe fully satisfied. His speech was received with applause; he was hailed\r\n_imperator_; and the command in a war was voted to him, though without\r\nthe enemy being named. Reinforced by veterans of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s army he\r\nstarted along the _via Cassia_ to intercept the returning Salvidienus.\r\n\r\nInformed of these transactions C\xc3\xa6sar hurried to Rome, leaving Sentinum\r\nstill besieged. But it was Agrippa who struck the decisive blow. With\r\nsuch forces as he could collect he, too, marched on the heels of Antonius\r\nalong the _via Cassia_, and occupied Sutrium, about thirty miles from\r\nthe city. This cut off L. Antonius\xe2\x80\x99s communications with Rome, who,\r\nwith Salvidienus in front of him and Agrippa in his rear, could neither\r\nadvance or retire along the _Cassia_ without fighting. With an enemy\r\non both sides of him he did not venture to give battle, but turned off\r\nthe road to Perusia. At first he encamped outside the town expecting to\r\nbe soon relieved by Pollio and Ventidius. But finding that they were\r\nmoving slowly, and that three hostile armies\xe2\x80\x94under C\xc3\xa6sar, Agrippa, and\r\nSalvidienus\xe2\x80\x94were threatening him, he retired within the walls; where he\r\nthought he might safely winter. C\xc3\xa6sar at once began throwing up lines of\r\ncircumvallation, and cut him off from all chance of supply. Perusia is on\r\na hill overlooking the Tiber and the Trasimene lake. But its position,\r\nalmost impregnable to assault, made it also somewhat easy to blockade.\r\nFulvia was active in urging the legates of Antony in Gaul and North\r\nItaly to come to the relief of Lucius. But Pollio and Ventidius hesitated\r\nand doubted, not feeling certain of the wishes of Marcus; and though\r\nPlancus cut up one legion on its march to join C\xc3\xa6sar, neither he nor any\r\nof the others ventured to engage him when he and Agrippa threw themselves\r\nin their way. Pollio retired to Ravenna, Ventidius to Ariminum, Plancus\r\nto Spoletium, leaving Lucius to his fate; while Fufius Calenus remained\r\nin the Alpine region without stirring. Meanwhile Salvidienus proceeded to\r\nSentinum, which he took, and shortly afterwards received the surrender of\r\nNursia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 40 Cos, C. Asinius Pollio, Cn. Domitius Calvinus. Fall of\r\nPerusia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Livia.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was thus able to use his whole force against Perusia. The blockade\r\nlasted till March, B.C. 40, when L. Antonius was compelled to surrender\r\nby hunger. C\xc3\xa6sar had taken an active share in the siege throughout, and\r\nhad run serious risks, at one time being nearly captured in a sally of\r\ngladiators while engaged in sacrifice; at another being in danger from\r\na mutiny in his own army. On the fall of Perusia the townsmen suffered\r\nseverely from the victorious soldiery, apparently without the order, and\r\nperhaps against the wish, of C\xc3\xa6sar; and in the course of the sack the\r\ntown itself was accidentally set on fire and in great part destroyed.\r\nThere is again a conflict of testimony as to C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s severities.\r\nSuetonius says that he executed a great number, answering all appeals\r\nwith a stern \xe2\x80\x9cDeath!\xe2\x80\x9d (_moriendum est_): and his enemies asserted that\r\nhe deliberately enticed L. Antonius into the war to have an excuse for\r\nthus ridding himself of his opponents. Some also reported that he caused\r\n300 to be put to death on the Ides of March, at an altar dedicated to\r\nIulius. On the other hand, it is certain that L. Antonius was allowed to\r\ngo away in safety; and Livy says that C\xc3\xa6sar pardoned him and \xe2\x80\x9call his\r\nsoldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d Appian attributes the death of such leading men as fell to the\r\nvindictiveness of the soldiers. Velleius, of course, takes the same view;\r\nwhile Dio, equally of course, agrees rather with Suetonius. The first\r\nwriter to mention the _Perusin\xc3\xa6 ar\xc3\xa6_ is Seneca; but as his object was to\r\ncontrast the clemency of Nero with the cruelty of Augustus, it is fair\r\nto suspect that he was not very particular as to the historical basis\r\nfor his allegations. If there were some executions and also some altar\r\ndedicated to Iulius\xe2\x80\x94both of which are more than probable\xe2\x80\x94it would be easy\r\nfor popular imagination to connect the two. No doubt all in Perusia who\r\nwere implicated in the assassination, or had been on the proscription\r\nlists, would have short shrift.[182] The altar story is unlike the usual\r\ngood sense of Augustus; but it seems that in this siege he desired to\r\nemphasise the fact that he was the avenger of his \xe2\x80\x9cfather,\xe2\x80\x9d some at least\r\nof the leaden bullets used by the slingers bearing the words _Divom\r\nIulium_.[183] At any rate, whether during the siege or by executions\r\nafter it, there seems no doubt that at Perusia a blow was struck at the\r\nold republican party\xe2\x80\x94already decimated by civil war and proscription\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nwhich it never recovered. The victory, moreover, left C\xc3\xa6sar supreme in\r\nItaly. The legates of M. Antonius for the most part abandoned their\r\nlegions and went to join him, or to Sicily to join Sextus Pompeius, who\r\nwas already negotiating with Antony. Fufius Calenus, indeed, refused to\r\nsurrender his eleven legions; but he died shortly afterwards, and his\r\nson handed them over to C\xc3\xa6sar. Plancus, abandoned by his two legions,\r\nescaped to Antony. Ventidius seems to have done the same; while Pollio,\r\nthough not leaving Italy, hung about the east coast in expectation of\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. Among others, Tiberius Nero abandoned a garrison which\r\nhe was commanding, and, with his wife Livia (soon to be the wife of\r\nAugustus) and his infant son (afterwards the Emperor Tiberius), fled to\r\nSextus Pompeius. Thither also went Antony\xe2\x80\x99s mother Iulia, whom Pompeius\r\nreceived with respect and employed as envoy to her son; while Fulvia\r\nembarked at Brundisium and sailed to Athens to meet her husband. In Italy\r\nthere was no one to rival C\xc3\xa6sar, who by these surrenders and desertions\r\nhad now a formidable army. What he had still to fear was a combination of\r\nAntony and Sextus Pompeius and an invasion of Italy by their joint forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fresh terms with M. Antonius.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage with Scribonia, B.C. 40.]\r\n\r\nSuch an invasion was, in fact, contemplated. Antony was in Asia when\r\nhe heard of the fall of Perusia. Crossing to Athens he met Fulvia and\r\nhis mother Iulia, the latter bringing an offer from Sextus Pompeius of\r\nsupport against C\xc3\xa6sar. Antony was in no good humour with his wife or\r\nhis agents, whom he must have regarded as having blundered. Nor was he\r\nprepared to begin hostilities at once. But he promised that if Sextus did\r\nso he would accept his aid; and that, even if he did not, he would do\r\nhis best to include him in any terms made with C\xc3\xa6sar. Meanwhile, though\r\nthe veterans were shy of enlisting against Antony, C\xc3\xa6sar found himself\r\nat the head of more than forty legions, and with such an army had no\r\nfear of not holding his own on land. But his opponents were strong at\r\nsea, and, if they joined with Sextus Pompeius, would have the coasts\r\nof Italy at their mercy. He therefore tried on his own account to come\r\nto an understanding with Pompeius. With this view he caused M\xc3\xa6cenas to\r\nnegotiate his marriage with Scribonia, sister of Scribonius Libo, and\r\naunt to the wife of Pompeius. He had been betrothed in early life to a\r\ndaughter of his great-uncle\xe2\x80\x99s colleague, P. Servilius Isauricus, and in\r\nB.C. 43 to Antony\xe2\x80\x99s stepdaughter, Clodia. But neither marriage had been\r\ncompleted, and at the beginning of Fulvia\xe2\x80\x99s opposition, in B.C. 41, he\r\nhad repudiated Clodia. The present union was one of political convenience\r\nonly. Scribonia had been twice married, and by her second husband had a\r\nson only a few years younger than C\xc3\xa6sar himself. She was therefore much\r\nthe older, and seems also to have been of difficult temper. That at\r\nleast was the reason he gave for the divorce which followed a year later,\r\non the day on which she gave birth to her daughter Iulia. But a truer\r\nreason (besides his passion for Livia) was the fact that by that time\r\ncircumstances were changed, and it was not necessary, or even convenient,\r\nto have such a connection with Sextus Pompeius any longer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First reconciliation of Brundisium, and new division of the\r\nEmpire.]\r\n\r\nAntony arrived off Brundisium in the summer of B.C. 40, and was joined\r\nby Sextus and Domitius Ahenobarbus. The three made some descents upon\r\nthe coast and threatened Brundisium with a blockade. But before much\r\ndamage had been done the interference of common friends brought about\r\na reconciliation. Antony consented to order Sextus Pompeius to return\r\nto Sicily, and to send away Ahenobarbus as propr\xc3\xa6tor of Bithynia. A\r\nconference was held at Brundisium, at which Pollio represented Antony,\r\nM\xc3\xa6cenas C\xc3\xa6sar, while M. Cocceius Nerva (great-grandfather of the Emperor)\r\nattended as a common friend of both. The reconciliation here effected\r\nwas to be confirmed by the marriage of Antony (whose wife Fulvia had\r\njust died at Sicyon) to C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s sister Octavia, widow of C. Claudius\r\nMarcellus, the consul of B.C. 50. The two triumvirs accordingly embraced,\r\nand agreed to a new division of the Empire. An imaginary line was to be\r\ndrawn through Scodra (_Scutari_) on the Illyrian coast. All west of this\r\nline, up to the Ocean, was to be under the care of C\xc3\xa6sar, except Africa,\r\nwhich was already in the hands of Lepidus; all east of it, up to the\r\nEuphrates, was to go to Antony. The war against Sextus Pompeius (unless\r\nhe came to terms) was to be the common care of both, in spite of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecent negotiations with him. C\xc3\xa6sar, on his part, agreed to amnesty all\r\nwho had joined Antony from the armies of Brutus and Cassius, in some\r\ncases even though they had been among the assassins.[184] Lastly, both\r\nwere to have the right to enlist an equal number of soldiers in Italy.\r\nThis agreement was followed by an interchange of hospitalities, in which\r\nAntony displayed the luxury and splendour learnt at the Egyptian court,\r\nwhile C\xc3\xa6sar affected the simplicity of a Roman and a soldier.[185]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A new agreement with Sext. Pompeius, B.C. 39.]\r\n\r\nBut Sextus did not tamely submit to be thus thrown over. He resumed\r\nhis old plan of starving out Italy. His freedman, Menodorus, wrested\r\nSardinia from the governor sent by C\xc3\xa6sar, and his ships, cruising off\r\nSicily, intercepted the corn-ships from Africa. The people of Rome\r\nwere threatened with famine, and on the arrival of C\xc3\xa6sar and Antony to\r\ncelebrate the marriage, though an ovation was decreed to both, there\r\nwere serious riots in which C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s life was in danger, and which had to\r\nbe suppressed by Antony\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers. They were forced by the outcry to\r\nrenew negotiations with Sextus, whose brother-in-law Libo\xe2\x80\x94in spite of the\r\nadvice of Menodorus\xe2\x80\x94arranged a meeting between him and the triumvirs at\r\nMisenum, early in B.C. 39. Every precaution was taken against treachery\r\nat the hands of Pompeius. And not without reason. The execution of\r\nBithynicus three years before had been followed and surpassed by the\r\ntreacherous murder of Statius Murcus, followed by the cruel crucifixion\r\nof his slaves on the pretence that the crime had been theirs. The\r\nconference was therefore held on temporary platforms erected at the\r\nend of the mole at Puteoli, with a space of water between them. But an\r\nagreement having been reached, Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar accepted a banquet on\r\nboard his ship; and when Menodorus suggested to Pompeius that he should\r\ncut the cables and sail away with them as prisoners, he answered that\r\nMenodorus should have done it without asking, but that he himself was\r\nbound by his oath. The terms made between them were that Sextus Pompeius\r\nwas to remain governor of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, with his\r\nfleet, as well as in Peloponnesus, but was to remove all garrisons from\r\nItalian towns and undertake not to hinder commerce or receive runaway\r\nslaves,[186] and should at once allow the corn which he had impounded to\r\nreach Italy. On the other hand, all men of rank who had taken refuge with\r\nhim were to have restitution of civil rights and property. If they had\r\nbeen on the proscription lists, they were to recover only a fourth; and\r\nif they had been condemned for the assassination, they were to be allowed\r\na safe place of exile. Those\xe2\x80\x94not coming under these three classes\xe2\x80\x94who had\r\nserved in his army or navy, were to have the same claim to pensions as\r\nthose in the armies of the triumvirs.\r\n\r\nPompeius then returned to Sicily, the triumvirs to Rome. Thence they went\r\ndifferent ways: Antony and Octavia to Athens; C\xc3\xa6sar to Gaul, where the\r\ndisturbed state of the country required his presence. Now, therefore,\r\nbegins the separate administration of East and West, and the different\r\nprinciples on which it was carried on contributed largely to the final\r\nrupture between the two men. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s was the otiose policy of setting\r\nup client kings who would take the trouble of government off his hands\r\nand yet be ready to pay him court and do him service, because their\r\ndignity and power depended upon his supremacy. Thus Darius, grandson\r\nof Mithradates, was appointed to Pontus; Herod to Idum\xc3\xa6a and Samaria;\r\nAmyntas to Pisidia; Polemon to a part of Cilicia. To C\xc3\xa6sar, on the other\r\nhand, fell the task of preserving order and establishing Roman rule in\r\ncountries nearer home, peace and good government in which were essential\r\nto the comfort of the city. Above all, he was bound to prevent Sextus\r\nPompeius from again interrupting the commerce and corn supply of Italy.\r\nThe only service of any of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s partisans near enough to be of active\r\ninterest to Rome was the victory of Pollio over the Parthini, for which\r\nhe was awarded a triumph.[187]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 38, renewed war with Sextus Pompeius.]\r\n\r\nBut the war with Sextus Pompeius soon became C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s chief task, and\r\nits renewal was with some justice laid at Antony\xe2\x80\x99s door. For being as\r\nhe thought unfairly treated by Antony as to the Peloponnese, which the\r\nlatter had declined to hand over till he had collected the year\xe2\x80\x99s taxes,\r\nPompeius once more began harassing the Italian shores and intercepting\r\ncorn-ships. C\xc3\xa6sar answered this by bringing troops from Gaul and building\r\nships. He established two dep\xc3\xb4ts\xe2\x80\x94at Brundisium and Puteoli\xe2\x80\x94and invited\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s presence at Brundisium to discuss the question of war. Antony\r\ndoubtless found it inconvenient to be closely pressed on this matter,\r\nfor he was greatly responsible for the difficulty. Though he came to\r\nBrundisium, therefore, he left again immediately, without waiting for\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, who had been delayed. He gave out that he was opposed to any\r\nbreach of the treaty with Pompeius, ignoring the fact that Pompeius\r\nhad already broken it. He even threatened to reclaim Menodorus as his\r\nslave, on the ground that he had been the slave of Cn. Pompeius, and had\r\ntherefore passed to him as the purchaser of Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s confiscated estate.\r\nUnable, therefore, to reckon on help from Antony, C\xc3\xa6sar undertook the\r\nbusiness himself. He strengthened assailable points on the Italian\r\ncoasts; collected ships at Rome and Ravenna; and took over Corsica and\r\nSardinia from Menodorus, who deserted to him and was made joint admiral\r\nwith Calvisius. He set sail himself from Tarentum, Calvisius from Cosa\r\nin Etruria; while a large army was stationed at Rhegium. Pompeius was\r\nalmost taken by surprise, but yet managed to reach Cum\xc3\xa6 and all but\r\ndefeat his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fleet. This was followed by a violent storm in which\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s fleet suffered severely, off the Skyll\xc3\xa6an promontory, and by a\r\nsecond battle in which it only escaped destruction by nightfall. A second\r\nterrible storm, which Pompeius\xe2\x80\x99s more experienced mariners managed to\r\navoid, still further reduced C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s sea forces. Pompeius, elated by\r\nthese successes, assumed the title of son of Neptune, and wore sea-green\r\nrobes as a sign of his origin.[188]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Activity of Agrippa, B.C. 37-6. Second reconciliation with\r\nAntony.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar did not give in, but he changed his generals. Agrippa was summoned\r\nfrom Gaul, where he had been very successful, and for the first time\r\nsince the expedition of Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar, had led an army across the Rhine.\r\nThe construction and command of a new fleet were entrusted to him.\r\nWith characteristic energy he not only built and manned a large number\r\nof ships, but began the formation of a new harbour (_portus Iulius_)\r\nfor their safety and convenience, by piercing the causeway between the\r\nsea and the Lucrine Lake, deepening the lake itself, and connecting it\r\nwith the lake Avernus. Here he practised his ships and men during the\r\nwinter, and by the summer of B.C. 36 was ready for action. Meanwhile\r\nfresh negotiations with Antony were conducted by M\xc3\xa6cenas, and in the\r\nspring of B.C. 37 a reconciliation was arranged at Tarentum, with the\r\nhelp of Octavia. The two triumvirs met on the river Taras, and after an\r\ninterchange of hospitalities they agreed: First, that the triumvirate\r\nshould be renewed for a second period of five years, that is, to the last\r\nday of B.C. 33.[189] Secondly, that Antony should supply C\xc3\xa6sar with 120\r\nships for the war against Sextus, and C\xc3\xa6sar give Antony 20,000 men for\r\nthe Parthian war, which was now becoming serious. Some farther mutual\r\npresents were made through Octavia, and Antony started for Syria leaving\r\nher and their child with her brother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continued war with Sextus Pompeius, B.C. 37-36.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s plan of campaign for B.C. 37 was that on the 1st of July a\r\ncombined attack should be made on Sicily, from three points\xe2\x80\x94from Africa\r\nby Lepidus, from Tarentum by Statilius Taurus, and from Puteoli by\r\nhimself. Another violent storm baffled this plan; C\xc3\xa6sar had to take\r\nrefuge at Elea; Taurus had to put back to Tarentum; while, though\r\nhe reached Sicily, Lepidus returned without effecting anything of\r\nimportance. Another winter and spring had to be spent on preparations,\r\nand it was not till the autumn of B.C. 36 that the final engagements\r\ntook place. At that time Pompeius\xe2\x80\x99s fleet was stationed along the\r\nSicilian coast from Messana to Tyndaris, with headquarters at Myl\xc3\xa6.\r\nAfter reconnoitring the position from the \xc3\x86olian islands, C\xc3\xa6sar left the\r\nmain attack to Agrippa, while he himself joined Taurus at Leucopetra.\r\nAgrippa repulsed the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ships, but not decisively enough to enable\r\nhim to pursue them to their moorings. It was sufficient, however, to\r\nenable C\xc3\xa6sar to cross to Tauromenium, leaving his main body of men on\r\nthe Italian shore under the command of Valerius Messalla. Here he soon\r\nfound himself in the greatest danger. Pompeius\xe2\x80\x99s fleet was not held up\r\nby Agrippa, as C\xc3\xa6sar thought, but appeared off Tauromenium in force.\r\nMessalla was unable to cross to his relief, and a body of Pompeian\r\ncavalry attacked him while his men were making their camp. C\xc3\xa6sar himself\r\nmanaged to get back to Italy, but he left three legions, 500 cavalry, and\r\n2,000 veterans, under Cornificius, encamped near Tauromenium, surrounded\r\nby enemies, and without means of supply. He himself landed in a forlorn\r\ncondition, with only one attendant, and with great difficulty found his\r\nway to the camp of Messalla. Thence he sent urgent orders to Agrippa to\r\ndespatch a force to the relief of Cornificius; commanded Messalla to send\r\nfor reinforcements from Puteoli; while M\xc3\xa6cenas was sent to Rome with full\r\npowers to suppress the disorders likely to occur when the ill-success\r\nagainst Pompeius was known.\r\n\r\nThe force despatched by Agrippa found Cornificius and his men in a\r\nstate of desperate suffering in the difficult district of Mount \xc3\x86tna,\r\nand conveyed them to the fleet off Myl\xc3\xa6. So far, though Pompeius had\r\nmaintained his reputation at sea, he had not shown himself able to follow\r\nup a success on land. And now the tide turned against him. Agrippa seized\r\nTyndaris, in which Pompeius had large stores, and C\xc3\xa6sar landed twenty-one\r\nlegions there, with 2,000 cavalry and 5,000 light-armed troops. His plan\r\nwas to assault Messana while Agrippa engaged the fleet. There was a good\r\nroad from Tyndaris to Messana (_via Valeria_), but Pompeius still held\r\nMyl\xc3\xa6 and other places along the coast with the defiles leading to them.\r\nHe was misled, however, by a report of an immediate attack by Agrippa,\r\nand, withdrawing his men from these defiles and strong posts, allowed\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar to occupy them. Finding the report to be false, he again attempted\r\nto intercept C\xc3\xa6sar as he was marching with some difficulty over the\r\ndistrict of Mount Myconium. But his general (Tisienus) failed to take\r\nadvantage of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s unfavourable position, who, having meanwhile been\r\njoined by Lepidus, encamped under the walls of Messana. He was now strong\r\nenough on land to send detachments to occupy the various towns from which\r\nPompeius drew supplies; and therefore it was necessary for the latter\r\nto abandon Sicily, or to scatter the fleet of Agrippa and so open the\r\nsea to his transports. In a second battle off Myl\xc3\xa6, however, the fleet\r\nof Pompeius was nearly annihilated, and though he escaped himself into\r\nMessana, his land forces under Tisienus surrendered to C\xc3\xa6sar. When he\r\ndiscovered this Pompeius, without waiting for the eight legions which\r\nhe still had at Lilyb\xc3\xa6um, collected seventeen ships which had survived\r\nthe battle and fled to Asia, hoping that Antony in gratitude for former\r\nservices would save and possibly employ him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deposition of Lepidus.]\r\n\r\nThe danger which for so many years had hung like a cloud about the shores\r\nof Italy was thus at an end. But there was one more danger still to be\r\nsurmounted before C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s authority was fully established in Sicily. The\r\neight Pompeian legions from Lilyb\xc3\xa6um under Plennius presently arrived at\r\nMessana. Finding Pompeius fled, as C\xc3\xa6sar happened to be absent, Plennius\r\nhanded them over to Lepidus, who was on the spot. Lepidus added them\r\nto his own forces, and being thus strengthened, conceived the idea of\r\nadding Sicily to his province of Africa. It had not been definitely\r\nincluded in any of the triumviral agreements; he had been the first to\r\nland there, and had in the course of his march forced or persuaded many\r\ncities to submit,\xe2\x80\x94why should he have less authority to deal with it than\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, whose office was the same as his own? He had originally bargained\r\nfor Narbonensis and Spain: he had been shifted to Africa without being\r\nconsulted, and his provinces had been taken over by C\xc3\xa6sar. He was now\r\nat the head of twenty-two legions, and would no longer be treated as a\r\nsubordinate. His arguments were sound; but they needed to be backed by\r\na determination as fixed as that of his rival, and, above all, by the\r\nloyalty of his army. Neither of these advantages were his. In a stormy\r\ninterview with C\xc3\xa6sar he shewed that he could scold as loudly as another.\r\nBut when they had parted, he failed from indolence or blindness to detect\r\nthat C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s agents were undermining the fidelity of his men, especially\r\nin the Pompeian legions, by informing them that without C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s assent\r\nthe promises made them by Lepidus would not be held valid. On his next\r\nvisit to the camp of Lepidus with a small bodyguard, C\xc3\xa6sar was mobbed by\r\nthe soldiers, and even had some of his guard killed, but when in revenge\r\nfor this he invested Lepidus with his main army, the forces of the latter\r\nbegan quickly to melt away, and before many days he was compelled to\r\nthrow himself at C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s feet. He was forced to abdicate the triumvirate,\r\nand sent to reside in Italy, where he remained till his death (B.C. 13),\r\nin a private capacity and subject to constant mortifications. He retained\r\nindeed the office of Pontifex Maximus, because of certain religious\r\ndifficulties as to its abdication, but he was never allowed to exercise\r\nany but the most formal functions. This treatment of a colleague was not\r\ngenerous; but the whole career of Lepidus since the beginning of the\r\ncivil war had been weak and shifty. He was \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest weathercock in\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x9d (_ventosissimus_),[190] as Decimus Brutus told Cicero, and he\r\ncertainly presents the most pitiful figure of all the leading men of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fate of Sextus Pompeius, B.C. 35.]\r\n\r\nThe old policy of Philippi and Perusia was followed as regards the\r\nforces of Pompeius. Senators and equites were, it is to be feared, in\r\nmany cases put to the sword; while the rank and file were admitted into\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s army, and an amnesty was granted to those Sicilian towns which\r\nhad submitted either to Pompeius or Lepidus. Africa and Sicily C\xc3\xa6sar\r\ntook over as his part of the Empire and appointed propr\xc3\xa6tors to each.\r\nHe did not attempt to pursue Sextus Pompeius; he preferred that Antony\r\nshould have the responsibility and perhaps the odium of dealing with him.\r\nIn fact, he did some years afterwards make his execution a ground of\r\ncomplaint against Antony. Yet Antony seems to have had little choice in\r\nthe matter. For Pompeius acted in Asia much as he had acted in Sicily\r\nand Italy, capturing towns and plundering ships, while sending peaceful\r\nembassies to Antony, offering to serve him against C\xc3\xa6sar. Being at last\r\ncompelled to surrender to Amyntas (made king of Pisidia by Antony), and\r\nbeing by him delivered to Antony\xe2\x80\x99s legate Titius, he was taken to Miletus\r\nand there put to death. But it was, and still remains, uncertain whether\r\nthis was done by Antony\xe2\x80\x99s order.\r\n\r\nHe was just forty, and had led a strange life since he witnessed his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death from the ship off the coast of Egypt. He seems to have\r\nhad some generous qualities which attached men to him. But the times\r\nwere out of joint, and he was compelled to live the life of a pirate\r\nand freebooter, having a grievance against every successive party that\r\ngained power at Rome, trusting none, and feeling no obligation to treat\r\nthem as fellow citizens or even as noble enemies. He seems to have missed\r\nmore than one chance of crushing C\xc3\xa6sar; but his troops, though numerous,\r\nwere fitted neither by spirit nor by discipline to encounter regularly\r\ntrained legions in open fight. We cannot withhold a certain admiration\r\nfor the courage and energy which maintained him as virtual ruler of no\r\ninconsiderable portion of the Roman Empire for nearly twelve years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTUS ADDRESSING TROOPS.\r\n\r\n_Photographed from the Statue in the Vatican by Edne.

Since\r\nthat time he had had little rest from grave anxieties or war. At Mutina,\r\nPhilippi, Perusia, and in Sicily, he had tasted danger and disaster as\r\nwell as victory; and had more than once been in imminent hazard. These\r\nfatigues had been made more trying by frequent illness, apparently\r\narising from a sluggish liver, to which he had been subject from boyhood.\r\nThrough all he had been supported by an indomitable persistence and a\r\npassionate resolve to avenge his adoptive father, all the more formidable\r\nperhaps in a character naturally cold and self-contained. As he went on\r\nthere gradually awoke in him a nobler ambition, that of restoring and\r\ndirecting the distracted state. Neither now nor afterwards do the more\r\nvulgar attributes of supreme power\xe2\x80\x94wealth, luxury, and adulation\xe2\x80\x94seem to\r\nhave had charms for him. He felt the governing power in him, he believed\r\nin his \xe2\x80\x9cgenius,\xe2\x80\x9d what we might call his \xe2\x80\x9cmission,\xe2\x80\x9d and the difficulties\r\nof a divided rule became more and more clear to him. From this time,\r\ntherefore, he used every means which wise statesmanship or crafty policy\r\ncould suggest to rid himself of the remaining partner in the Triumvirate,\r\nand to gain a free hand in the work of restoration which he had already\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage with Livia, B.C. 38.]\r\n\r\nIn private life he had taken a step which was the source of a lifelong\r\nhappiness to him. The political marriage with Scribonia in B.C. 40,\r\ncontracted with the idea of conciliating Sextus Pompeius, had been ended\r\nby divorce on the very day of the birth of his only daughter Iulia.\r\nThe reason alleged was her disagreeable disposition; but, besides the\r\nchange in the political situation, there was another reason of a more\r\npersonal nature. The peace of Misenum had permitted many partisans of\r\nBrutus, Cassius, or Lucius Antonius, who had fled to Sextus Pompeius,\r\nto return to Rome. Among others came Tiberius Nero,[191] with his young\r\nwife, Livia Drusilla. Unless statues and coins are more than usually\r\nfalse, she was possessed of rare beauty. In B.C. 38 she was twenty years\r\nold, and had one son (the future Emperor Tiberius) now in his fourth\r\nyear, and was within three months of the birth of her second son Drusus.\r\nEven to the lax notions of divorce and re-marriage then current this\r\nseemed somewhat scandalous. A year was held to be the necessary interval\r\nfor a woman between one marriage and another. But the object of this\r\nconvention was to prevent ambiguity as to the paternity of children; and\r\nwhen C\xc3\xa6sar consulted the pontifices, they told him that, if there was no\r\ndoubt as to the paternity of the child with which Livia was pregnant,\r\nthe marriage might lawfully take place at once. No opposition seems to\r\nhave been made by Livia\xe2\x80\x99s husband, who was at least twenty years her\r\nsenior.[192] He acted as a father in giving her to her new husband, and\r\nentertained the bridal pair at a banquet. The marriage was so prompt\r\nthat a favourite page of Livia\xe2\x80\x99s, seeing her take her place on the same\r\ndinner couch as C\xc3\xa6sar, whispered to his mistress that she had made a\r\nmistake, for her husband was on the other couch. On the birth of Drusus,\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar sent the infant to its father, thus complying with the conditions\r\nof the pontifices. That the two men should have been on good terms\r\nis not incredible in view of the prevailing sentiment as to divorce.\r\nWe find Cicero, for instance, writing effusively to Dolabella almost\r\ndirectly after he had compelled his daughter to divorce him for gross\r\nmisconduct, and there are other instances. At any rate Tiberius Nero, on\r\nhis death-bed in B.C. 33, left the guardianship of his sons to C\xc3\xa6sar; and\r\nin spite of such a beginning the marriage proved permanently happy. C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nwas devoted to Livia to the day of his death; his last conscious act was\r\nto kiss her lips.[193]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honours voted to C\xc3\xa6sar.]\r\n\r\nThe victory in Sicily left him supreme in the West, and he at once\r\ndevoted himself to the re-establishment of order and prosperity. The\r\nrelief to Italy and Rome was immense; for with Pompeius master of the\r\nsea the city was always in danger of famine, and the Italian coast of\r\ndevastation. This feeling of relief found expression in the proceedings\r\nof the Senate, which now began those votes of special honours and powers\r\nto C\xc3\xa6sar, which in the course of the next ten or twelve years gradually\r\nclothed him with every attribute of supremacy in the state. On his return\r\nfrom Sicily he was decreed an ovation, as after Philippi,[194] as well\r\nas statues and a triumphal arch. On the day of the victory over Pompeius\r\n(2nd of September), there were to be _feri\xc3\xa6_ and _supplicationes_ for\r\never; he and his wife and family were to be feasted on the Capitol;\r\nand he was to have the perpetual right of wearing the laurel wreath of\r\nvictory. He refused the office of Pontifex Maximus, as long as Lepidus\r\nlived, but he accepted the privileges of the tribuneship\xe2\x80\x94the personal\r\nsanctity which put any one injuring or molesting him under a curse, and\r\nthe right of sitting with the tribunes in the Senate. This it seems\r\ngave him practically the full _tribunicia potestas_ within the city.\r\nBut it was a novel measure, and its full consequences were not perhaps\r\nforeseen.[195] He had twice before wished to be elected tribune, but his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpatriciate\xe2\x80\x9d stood in his way. This was meant as a kind of compromise,\r\nand it furnishes the keynote to his later plans for absorbing the powers\r\nof the republican offices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Measures of conciliation and restoration.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The wars for security of frontiers.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s chief difficulties now came from the large military forces of\r\nwhich he found himself possessed, either by his own enlistment or from\r\nthat of the various defeated leaders. To disband them was neither safe in\r\nview of possible complications with Antony, nor possible without finding\r\nlarge sums of money or great tracts of unoccupied land with which to\r\nreward the men; whereas his object now was to put an end to confiscation,\r\nfines, and unusual imposts, and to bring back confidence and security.\r\nAfter suppressing more than one incipient mutiny, he contrived to secure\r\nenough land for those who had served their full time, partly by purchases\r\nfrom Capua, where there was still a good deal of unassigned land. He\r\nrepaid the colony by granting it revenues from lands at Cnossus in\r\nCrete, which had become _ager publicus_ on the defeat of the pirates, and\r\non some of which a Roman colony was not long afterwards established.[196]\r\nSome of the men, again, who had been most clamorous and mutinous he sent\r\nto Gaul as a _supplementum_ to colonies already existing, or to found\r\nnew colonies.[197] He was thus able to make remission of taxation, as\r\nwell as of arrears due from the lists of forfeiture published by the\r\ntriumvirs. His enemies said that his object was to throw the odium of\r\ntheir original imposition upon Antony and Lepidus; or to make a merit of\r\nnecessity, since in most cases it would have been impossible to collect\r\nthe money. These motives may have had a share in his policy, but he\r\ndoubtless also wished to restore confidence and cause an oblivion of\r\nthe miseries of the civil wars. For the soldiers who remained various\r\nother employments were found. The weakness of the central government had\r\nlong been shewn by the existence of marauding bands in various parts\r\nof Italy. The civil wars had aggravated the evil, till travelling had\r\nbecome dangerous almost everywhere, and even the streets of Rome were\r\nunsafe. C\xc3\xa6sar now organised a police force of soldiers under Sabinus\r\nCotta to patrol the city and Italy, and within a few months the evil\r\nwas much mitigated.[198] Besides this, Statilius Taurus was sent with\r\nan army to restore order in the two African provinces\xe2\x80\x94Proconsularis and\r\nNumidia.[199] Another expedition was sent against the Salassi, inhabiting\r\nthe modern Val d\xe2\x80\x99Aosta, who had for two years been holding out against\r\nAntistius Vetus. He had driven them into their mountain fastnesses; but\r\nwhen he left the district they once more descended and expelled the Roman\r\ngarrisons. The war was entrusted to Valerius Messalla, who reduced them\r\nat least to temporary submission (B.C. 35-34).[200] Another similar war\r\nwas that against the Iapydes, living in what is now Croatia, who in their\r\nmarauding expeditions had come as far as Aquileia and plundered Roman\r\ncolonies. To this C\xc3\xa6sar went in person. He destroyed their capital,\r\nMetulum, on the Colapis (mod. _Kolpa_), after a desperate resistance, in\r\nthe course of which he was somewhat severely injured by the fall of a\r\nbridge. The rest of the country then submitted.[201] The Iapydes had no\r\ndoubt provoked the attack. But that does not seem to be the case with the\r\nPannonians, whom C\xc3\xa6sar proceeded to invade. They were a mixed Illyrian\r\nand Celtic tribe, dwelling in forests and detached villages without great\r\ntowns, and appear to have lived peaceably. But C\xc3\xa6sar resolved to take\r\ntheir one important town, Siscia, at the junction of the Kolpa and Save,\r\npartly as a convenient magazine in wars against the Daci, and partly for\r\nthe mere object of keeping his army employed and paid at the expense\r\nof a conquered country. The siege of the town lasted thirty days, and\r\nafter its fall he returned to Rome, leaving Fufius Geminus to continue\r\nthe campaign. So again in the spring of B.C. 34 Agrippa was sent against\r\nthe Dalmatians, and when later in the season he was joined by C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nin person, their chief towns were taken and burnt; and this people,\r\nwho since their defeat of Gabinius in B.C. 44-43, had been practically\r\nindependent, had again to submit and pay tribute, with ten years\xe2\x80\x99\r\narrears, and restore the standards taken from Gabinius. Their submission\r\nwas followed by that of other tribes, and by the middle of B.C. 33, the\r\nwhole of Illyricum was restored to obedience.\r\n\r\nThese were the sort of successes to make a man popular at Rome; for they\r\nwere not costly in blood or treasure, and they affected the interests\r\nof a large number of merchants and men of business. Nor was this all.\r\nOne of his legates, Statilius Taurus, was so successful in Africa, and\r\nanother, C. Norbanus, in Spain, that both were decreed triumphs in B.C.\r\n34, and in the same year Mauretania was made a Roman province. C\xc3\xa6sar had\r\ndeclined a triumph after the Pannonian war, but accepted honours for\r\nOctavia and Livia, who were exempted from the _tutela_, to which all\r\nwomen were subject; and during these two years his name was becoming\r\nassociated with success and with the expansion of the Empire and of trade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Improvements in the city.]\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied by restorations and improvements in the city\r\ncalculated to appeal still more strongly to popular imagination. In B.C.\r\n33 Agrippa as \xc3\xa6dile reformed the water supply of Rome, constructing 700\r\nbasins, 500 fountains, and repairing the aqueducts.[202] He also cleansed\r\nthe cloac\xc3\xa6, adorned the circus, distributed oil and salt free, and opened\r\nthe baths gratis throughout his year of office, besides throwing among\r\nthe spectators at the theatre _tesser\xc3\xa6_ (tickets) entitling the holders\r\nto valuable presents. C\xc3\xa6sar himself, who was consul for a few months at\r\nthe beginning of B.C. 33, erected the Porticus Octavi\xc3\xa6, named in honour\r\nof his sister, with the spoils of the Illyrian and Pannonian wars,[203]\r\nand began the building of the temple of Apollo and the two libraries, on\r\nthe site bought for a house on the Palatine before B.C. 36, when that of\r\nHortensius had been granted to him by the Senate,[204] and while he was\r\nstill living in the house of Calvus near the Forum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The contrast of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s career.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Parthians.]\r\n\r\nThese successes in the Western provinces, combined with such costly\r\nimprovements in the city, impressed (as it was intended that they should)\r\nthe minds of the people in Rome with the feeling that C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nthe best guarantee for the era of peace and prosperity which seemed\r\nat last to be succeeding the ruin and horror of civil war. In strong\r\ncontrast\xe2\x80\x94carefully emphasized by C\xc3\xa6sar and his friends\xe2\x80\x94were the military\r\nexpeditions in the East, and the extravagance of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation for\r\nCleopatra in Egypt. In B.C. 40 he had been roused from the intoxication\r\nof love and revelry in Alexandria to find Syria in the hands of the\r\nParthian Pacorus, son of Orodes, and of Labienus, son of the old legate\r\nof Iulius, who had joined the enemy after the battle of Philippi. They\r\nhad defeated and killed his legate, Decidius Saxa, and taken possession\r\nof the province. It is true that next year, B.C. 39, P. Ventidius drove\r\naway Labienus, and in B.C. 38 defeated the Parthians and killed Pacorus.\r\nBut Antony was jealous of Ventidius, deposed him from his command, and\r\nwent in person to besiege the remains of the Parthian army in Samosata,\r\nwhere they had been received by Antiochus, king of Commagene. He failed\r\nto take the town, and though in his despatch he took all the credit of\r\nprevious successes, the truth was well known in Rome. After his failure\r\nat Samosata he made somewhat inglorious terms with Antiochus, and going\r\noff to meet C\xc3\xa6sar at Tarentum left C. Sosius in charge of Syria. Sosius\r\nput down an insurrection in Jud\xc3\xa6a and established Herod as king (B.C.\r\n38-7). But in B.C. 36 Antony suffered severe reverses in an expedition\r\nagainst Phraates, who had just succeeded his father Orodes as king of\r\nParthia. One success, however, in the course of an inglorious campaign\r\nenabled him to send home laurelled despatches, the real value of which\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar and his friends took care should be known. In B.C. 35 he began\r\ncarving out a kingdom for his elder son by Cleopatra, and making\r\npreparations for an expedition against the king of Armenia, whom he\r\naccused of failing in his duty of supporting him in the previous year.\r\nHaving first made a treaty of friendship with the king of Media, in B.C.\r\n34 he invaded Armenia, and getting possession of the person of the king\r\nby an act of treachery which shocked Roman sentiment\xe2\x80\x94not very scrupulous\r\nin such matters\xe2\x80\x94he brought him in silver chains to Alexandria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleopatra.]\r\n\r\nThus Antony\xe2\x80\x99s career as an administrator and defender of the Empire\r\nwas rightly or wrongly looked upon as comparing unfavourably with that\r\nof C\xc3\xa6sar. But still more shocking to Roman feeling was his position in\r\nCleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s court. Though the moral standard at Rome was far from high,\r\nit was rigid in regard to certain details. Just as a valid marriage\r\ncould only be contracted with a woman who was a _civis_, so for a man\r\nin high position to live openly with a foreign mistress, however high\r\nher rank, was peculiarly scandalous. The beloved Emperor Titus, a\r\nhundred years later, had to give way to this sentiment and dismiss his\r\nIdum\xc3\xa6an mistress. But that a Roman imperator should not only have such a\r\nconnection with a \xe2\x80\x9cbarbarous\xe2\x80\x9d queen, but should act as her officer and\r\ncourtier; that she should have a bodyguard of Roman soldiers; should give\r\nthe watchword to them as their sovereign; and should even employ them to\r\ndeal with what in one sense or another was Roman territory\xe2\x80\x94this seemed an\r\noutrage of the worst kind. In a poem written it seems while the campaign\r\nat Actium was still undecided, but when rumours of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s defeat were\r\nreaching Rome, Horace well expresses the disgust with which the position\r\nconceded to Cleopatra by Antony\xe2\x80\x99s fondness was regarded:\r\n\r\n    False, false the tale our grandsons will declare\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    That Romans to a woman fealty sware;\r\n    Shouldered their pikes; presented arms; and did\r\n    Whate\xe2\x80\x99er her wrinkled eunuchs deigned to bid:\r\n    Or that among our Roman flags were seen\r\n    The gauzy curtains of her palanquin.\xe2\x80\x9d[205]\r\n\r\nAntony himself made no concealment as to the queen\xe2\x80\x99s connection with\r\nthe army. After his disastrous expedition of B.C. 36-5, Cleopatra\r\nsupplied him with money, and he told his men when paying them that\r\nthey were receiving it from her. The connection also involved a breach\r\nwith C\xc3\xa6sar. Their friendship\xe2\x80\x94always doubtful\xe2\x80\x94had been patched up from\r\ntime to time by formal reconciliations; in B.C. 43 after Mutina; in\r\nB.C. 40 at Brundisium; and in B.C. 37 at Tarentum. For a time Antony\r\nhad found great pleasure in the society of Octavia, with whom he lived\r\nfor a time at Athens. But after the meeting at Tarentum he left Octavia\r\nwith her brother on his return to the East, and soon fell again under\r\nCleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s spell, who, though not beautiful, fascinated him by her art\r\nand infinite variety. When in B.C. 35 Octavia, trying to effect another\r\nreconciliation, went to Athens, taking money and soldiers for him from\r\nher brother, Antony accepted the gifts, but sent her word that she was\r\nto return to Rome. C\xc3\xa6sar would have had her repudiate him at once, but\r\nshe seems to have been sincerely attached to him, and to have shrunk\r\nfrom the idea of an insult to herself being made an occasion of civil\r\nwar. She persisted in living in his town house, and in bringing up with\r\nliberality, not only her own children by him, but also Antony\xe2\x80\x99s children\r\nby Fulvia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Final breach between C\xc3\xa6sar and Antony.]\r\n\r\nBut after his return from the Armenian expedition (B.C. 34) Antony became\r\nstill more infatuated with Cleopatra. He publicly gave her the title of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQueen of Queens,\xe2\x80\x9d and her eldest son the name of C\xc3\xa6sarion and \xe2\x80\x9cKing\r\nof Kings\xe2\x80\x9d; while to his two sons and daughter by Cleopatra he assigned\r\nkingdoms in Syria, Armenia, Libya, and Cyrene. He had the assurance to\r\nwrite to the Senate asking for the confirmation of these _acta_. When\r\nhis two friends, C. Sosius and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus entered on their\r\nconsulship (1st of January, B.C. 32), they resolved to suppress this\r\ndespatch, in spite of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s wishes; but they communicated to the Senate\r\nhis message that the second period of the Triumvirate having expired\r\n(on the last day of B.C. 33), he had no desire for its renewal. He did\r\nnot, however, lay down his imperium, and the object of this declaration\r\nwas to embroil C\xc3\xa6sar with the Senate, should he wish to retain his\r\nextraordinary powers. Ahenobarbus, indeed, had had enough of civil war\r\nand wished to take no step likely to bring it about. But Sosius made\r\nan elaborate speech in praise of Antony, and attacking, or at least\r\ndepreciating, C\xc3\xa6sar; and was only prevented from bringing in a motion\r\nin Antony\xe2\x80\x99s favour by the intervention of a tribune. A few days after\r\nthis C\xc3\xa6sar (who had not been present on the 1st of January) summoned the\r\nSenate, and delivered a speech from the consular bench, which though\r\nstudiously moderate as regards himself, was very outspoken as regards\r\nSosius and Antony. No one ventured to reply, and the Senate was dismissed\r\nwith the assurance that C\xc3\xa6sar would produce proofs of what he had said\r\nabout Antony. The two consuls, without taking any farther step, left\r\nRome privately and joined Antony in Alexandria. They were followed by a\r\nconsiderable number of Senators, C\xc3\xa6sar giving out that they went with his\r\nfull consent, and declaring that others might go if they chose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The grievances of either side.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War proclaimed against Cleopatra, B.C. 32.]\r\n\r\nThis was a division of the governing body similar to that of B.C. 49-8,\r\nand it was evident that a civil war was imminent. Sentiment was by no\r\nmeans all on one side at Rome, as is proved by the numbers of the Senate\r\nwho crossed to Antony. Party feeling, in fact, was so keen that the very\r\nboys in the streets divided themselves into C\xc3\xa6sarians and Antonians;[206]\r\nand both leaders shewed great eagerness by arguments and declarations to\r\nput themselves in the right. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s grievances against C\xc3\xa6sar were:\r\n(1) that he deprived Lepidus of Africa without consulting him; (2) that\r\nhe had not shared with him the countries formerly controlled by Sextus\r\nPompeius; (3) that he enrolled soldiers in Italy without sending him\r\nthe contingents due by their agreement. C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s against Antony were\r\nthat he was occupying Egypt (not a Roman province) without authority;\r\nhad executed Sextus Pompeius, whom he (C\xc3\xa6sar) had wished to spare; had\r\ndisgraced the Roman name by his conduct to the king of Armenia, by his\r\nconnection with Cleopatra, and by bestowing kingdoms on his children by\r\nher; and, lastly, had wronged him by acknowledging C\xc3\xa6sarion as a son of\r\nIulius C\xc3\xa6sar. Letters and messages were interchanged for some months on\r\nthese and other points, both trying to justify themselves. Antony, in\r\none letter at least, preserved by Suetonius, ridicules in the coarsest\r\nterms what he regards as C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s hypocritical or prudish objection to his\r\nconnection with the queen. But at length C\xc3\xa6sar found means to discredit\r\nAntony in the eyes of the Senators, and to convince them that they must\r\nprevent an invasion of Italy by a proclamation of war against Cleopatra,\r\nwhich would be understood to be against Antony. He did this by using two\r\nof Antony\xe2\x80\x99s officers who had quarrelled with him and returned to Rome\xe2\x80\x94M.\r\nTitius and L. Munatius Plancus. The latter, Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s correspondent,\r\nthe governor of Celtic Gaul in B.C. 44, and consul in B.C. 42, had\r\njoined Antony in Alexandria as his _legatus_, and had been much in his\r\nconfidence. He is held up to scorn by contemporary writers as a monster\r\nof fickleness and an ingrained traitor, and his thus turning upon Antony\r\nwas regarded with much contempt even by the C\xc3\xa6sarians. The story he and\r\nhis companion had to tell, however, served C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s turn. They brought\r\nword that, on hearing of his speech in the Senate, Antony had publicly\r\ndivorced Octavia in the presence of the Senators, and had announced that\r\nhe intended to undertake a war against him. They also told how Antony\r\nstyled Cleopatra his queen and sovereign, gave her a bodyguard of Roman\r\nsoldiers, with her name on their shields; how he escorted her to the\r\nforum and sat by her side on the seat of justice; how, when she rode\r\nin her chair he walked on foot by her side among the eunuchs; how he\r\ncalled the general\xe2\x80\x99s quarters or pr\xc3\xa6torium \xe2\x80\x9cthe Palace,\xe2\x80\x9d wore an Egyptian\r\nscimitar and a robe embroidered with gold, and sat on a gilded chair;\r\nand how some religious mummeries had been played, in which he took the\r\npart of Osiris, she of the Moon and Isis. The Roman world believed that\r\nAntony was bewitched by Cleopatra; and the serious consequences likely to\r\nensue were made more manifest by his will, of which Augustus got either\r\na copy or an account of its contents from Plancus, and read it publicly\r\nfrom the Rostra. In it Antony affirmed the legitimacy of C\xc3\xa6sarion, gave\r\nenormous legacies to his children by Cleopatra, and ordered his body to\r\nbe buried with that of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s in the royal mausoleum. Altogether\r\npeople began to believe the report that he meant to hand over the Empire,\r\neven Rome itself, to Cleopatra, and to transfer the seat of government to\r\nAlexandria. There was one of those outbursts of feeling which carries all\r\nbefore it. Even those who had been neutral, or inclined to be suspicious\r\nof C\xc3\xa6sar, turned violently against Antony. He was deposed from the\r\nconsulship for B.C. 31, to which he had been elected, and declared to be\r\ndivested of imperium. It seems probable that he was not at first declared\r\na _hostis_,[207] but war was voted against Cleopatra. It was enough\r\nfor his enemies that he should be found fighting with the Egyptians\r\nagainst Rome; and the vote was well understood to include him. C\xc3\xa6sar was\r\nappointed to proclaim the war with all the _Fetial_ ceremonies, and the\r\nSenate assumed the _sagum_.[208]\r\n\r\nBoth sides were now making preparations in earnest. C\xc3\xa6sar could draw\r\nforces from Italy, Gaul, Spain, Illyricum, Sardinia, Sicily, and other\r\nislands. Antony relied on Asia, the parts about Thrace, Greece and\r\nMacedonia, Egypt, Cyrene, and the islands of the \xc3\x86gean, besides a large\r\nnumber of client kings who had owed their position to him.[209] He\r\nsilenced their scruples, when gathered at Samos, by pointing out that\r\nthey would not be formally at war with Rome, and promising that within\r\ntwo months of the victory he would lay down his imperium and remit all\r\npower to the Senate and people. Nor did he confine his exertions to\r\nthe East. Agents were sent to cities in Italy carrying money, though\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x94who kept himself well informed\xe2\x80\x94frustrated this attempt for the most\r\npart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antony approaches Italy.]\r\n\r\nFrom Samos Antony removed his headquarters to Athens, whence in the\r\nwinter of B.C. 32 he started to invade Italy. But at Corcyra he\r\ngot intelligence of an advanced squadron of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s fleet near the\r\nAcroceraunian promontory, and thinking that C\xc3\xa6sar was there in full\r\nforce, he decided to put off hostilities till the spring, by which time\r\nhe expected to be joined by the forces of the client kings. He himself\r\nwintered at Patr\xc3\xa6, distributing his forces so as to guard various points\r\nin Greece. He scornfully rejected C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for an interview, on\r\nthe ground that there was no one to decide between them, if either broke\r\nthe terms upon which they might agree. The proposal was probably not\r\nseriously meant. It was only another means of putting Antony in the wrong.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 31, Con., C. Octavius C\xc3\xa6sar, Val. Messala. The beginning\r\nof hostilities.]\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was done before the end of the year, a storm having\r\nfrustrated an attempt of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s to surprise some of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ships\r\nat Corcyra. In the early spring the first move was made by Agrippa,\r\nwho swooped down upon Methone in Messenia, killed Bogovas, late king\r\nof Mauretania, and harassed the shores of Greece by other descents, in\r\norder to divert Antony\xe2\x80\x99s attention; who was now with his main fleet in\r\nthe Ambracian gulf, having secured the narrow entrance to it by towers\r\non either side, and with ships stationed between. His camp was close to\r\nthe temple of Apollo, on the south side of the strait. The successes of\r\nAgrippa encouraged C\xc3\xa6sar to move. He landed troops in Ceraunia, making\r\nhis own headquarters at the \xe2\x80\x9cSweet Haven,\xe2\x80\x9d at the mouth of the Cocytus,\r\nand sent a detachment by land round the Ambracian sea to threaten\r\nAntony\xe2\x80\x99s camp. Having failed to entice the fleet from the Ambracian\r\ngulf, or to tempt the men to abandon Antony, he seized the high ground\r\noverlooking the strait, and opposite Actium, where he entrenched himself,\r\non the ground on which he afterwards built Nicopolis. The summer months,\r\nhowever, were wearing away without any decisive blow being struck by\r\neither side, and the delay was irksome to both. Rome was in a state of\r\nsimmering revolt owing to distress and heavy taxes, a discontent which\r\nfound expression in the conspiracy of Lepidus, son of the ex-triumvir.\r\nIt was promptly suppressed, indeed, and Lepidus was sent over to C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nto receive his condemnation; but, nevertheless, M\xc3\xa6cenas, who was in\r\ncharge of Rome, found that he had no sinecure. To Antony, again, delay\r\nmeant discontent among his Eastern followers, tottering loyalty, and\r\nprobable abandonment. Above all, Cleopatra was in a highly nervous state,\r\nand was urging a return to Egypt. At last on the 31st of August, a\r\ncavalry engagement going against Antony, she became clamorous; and after\r\nlong deliberation, Antony determined to follow her advice. He ordered\r\nhis ships to be prepared for battle, but with the secret intention of\r\navoiding a fight and sailing away to Alexandria.[210]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Actium, Sept. 3, B.C. 31.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was kept informed of this, and resolved to prevent it. His idea\r\nwas to allow the Antonian fleet to issue out and begin their course,\r\nand then to fall upon their rear. But Agrippa thought that the superior\r\nsailing powers of the Antonian fleet would render this impossible, and\r\nurged an attack as soon as the ships cleared the straits. There had\r\nbeen rough weather for four days, but on the 3rd of September there was\r\na calm,[211] or only some surf from the preceding storms; and when the\r\ntrumpet rang out for the start Antony\xe2\x80\x99s huge vessels, furnished with\r\ntowers and filled with armed men, began streaming out of the straits.\r\nThey did not at first show any signs of standing out to sea. The ships\r\ntook up a close order and waited to be attacked. There was a brief pause\r\non C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s side. He or Agrippa hesitated to attack these great galleons\r\nwith their smaller craft. But before long an order was issued to the\r\nvessels on the extremities of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s fleet to exert their utmost powers\r\nin rowing in order to get round Antony\xe2\x80\x99s two wings. To avoid this danger\r\nAntony was forced against his will to order an attack.\r\n\r\nThe battle raged all the afternoon without decisive result; though the\r\nsmallness of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s vessels proved in many points a decided advantage.\r\nThey could be rowed close up to bigger ships and be rowed away again\r\nwhen a shower of javelins had been poured in upon the enemy. Antony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen returned the volleys and used grappling irons of great weight. If\r\nthese irons caught one of the smaller ships they were doubtless very\r\neffective; but if the cast missed they either seriously damaged their own\r\nship, or caused so much confusion and delay that an opportunity was given\r\nto the enemy to pour in fresh volleys of darts. At length Cleopatra,\r\nwhose ships were on the southern fringe of the fleet, could bear the\r\nsuspense no longer. She gave the signal for retreat, and a favourable\r\nbreeze springing up, the Egyptian ships were soon fading out of sight.\r\nAntony thinking that this was the result of a panic, and that the day\r\nwas lost, hastened after the retiring squadron. The example of their\r\nleader was followed by many of the crews, who lightening their ships by\r\nthrowing overboard the wooden towers and war tackle, fled with sails full\r\nspread. But others still maintained the struggle, and it was not until\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s men began throwing lighted brands upon the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ships that the\r\nrout became general. Even then the work was not over, for C\xc3\xa6sar spent\r\nthe whole night on board endeavouring to rescue men from the burning\r\nships.[212]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The finale of the civil war in Egypt, B.C. 31-30.]\r\n\r\nAntony got clear off from pursuit, but his camp on land was easily taken,\r\nand his army was intercepted while trying to retreat into Macedonia. For\r\nthe most part the men took service in C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s legions, the veterans being\r\ndisbanded without pensions. Antony, however, was followed to Egypt by\r\nmany of his adherents of rank, and still thought himself strong enough\r\nto make terms with C\xc3\xa6sar. But he could no longer hope for aid from the\r\nclient kings. They all hastened to make their peace with C\xc3\xa6sar, or were\r\ncaptured and punished. Even Cleopatra was secretly prepared to betray him.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of one visit to Brundisium of seven days, to suppress\r\nthe mutiny of some discontented veterans, C\xc3\xa6sar spent the winter at\r\nSamos and Athens, collecting an army and navy destined to deprive Egypt\r\npermanently of its independence. Cleopatra had indeed tried to brave it\r\nout. She returned to Alexandria with her prows decked with flowers and\r\nher pipers playing a triumphant tune. The people are not likely to have\r\nbeen deceived, but there was no sign of revolt. She was able to seize\r\nthe property of those whose fidelity she suspected, and even put to\r\ndeath the captive king of Armenia to gratify her ally the king of Media.\r\nMessages were sent to the kings who had been allied with Antony, and for\r\nsome gladiators whom he had in training at Trapezus. The gladiators\r\nstarted but were intercepted, and no help came from the client kings.\r\nA still worse disappointment awaited him in Cyrene, over which he had\r\nplaced L. Pinarius Scarpus with four legions. When, leaving Cleopatra\r\nat Par\xc3\xa6tonium, he went to take over these legions, Pinarius refused to\r\nreceive him and even put his messengers to death, and shortly afterwards\r\nhanded over his province and army to C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s legate, Cornelius Gallus.\r\nThis was an unmistakable sign that Antony\xe2\x80\x99s day of influence was over.\r\nCleopatra returned to Alexandria and made secret preparations for\r\nretiring into Asia, as far as Iberia (_Georgia_) if necessary, though\r\nstill keeping up appearances and sending in every direction for aid.\r\nCleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s son C\xc3\xa6sarion and Antony\xe2\x80\x99s son by Fulvia (Antyllus) were\r\ndeclared of man\xe2\x80\x99s estate and capable of governing, and messages were\r\ndespatched to C\xc3\xa6sar proposing that Antony should retire to Athens as a\r\n_privatus_, and that Cleopatra should abdicate in favour of C\xc3\xa6sarion.\r\nThe queen also, without Antony\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, sent C\xc3\xa6sar a gold sceptre\r\nand crown. He made no reply to Antony, but answered in threatening terms\r\nto Cleopatra, while sending his freedman Thyrsus to give her privately a\r\nreassuring message. Antony suspected the purport of Thyrsus\xe2\x80\x99s mission,\r\nand with a last ebullition of his old swaggering humour had him flogged,\r\nand sent back with the message, that if C\xc3\xa6sar felt aggrieved he might\r\nput his freedman Hipparchus (who had joined C\xc3\xa6sar) to the torture in\r\nrevenge. But things went from bad to worse with him. News came that\r\nthe gladiators had been impounded, that his own legatus in Syria (Q.\r\nDidius) had bidden the Arabs burn the ships which he had prepared for his\r\nflight in the Red Sea, and that the only two client kings who had seemed\r\ninclined to stand by him\xe2\x80\x94those of Cilicia and Galatia\xe2\x80\x94had fallen off. He\r\ntherefore tried once more to open communications with C\xc3\xa6sar. He sent him\r\nas a prisoner one of the assassins of Iulius, whom he had protected and\r\nemployed, P. Turullius, and a considerable sum of money by the hands\r\nof his son Antyllus. C\xc3\xa6sar put Turullius to death and took the money,\r\nbut returned no answer to Antony, though he again sent a private message\r\nto Cleopatra. Presently Antony was informed that Gallus had arrived at\r\nPar\xc3\xa6tonium with the four legions taken over from Pinarius; and believing\r\nthat even now his personal influence was sufficient to win back the men,\r\nhe hurried thither, accompanied by the remains of his fleet coasting\r\nalong to guard him. But this only led to farther disaster. The soldiers\r\nrefused to listen to him; and when his ships entered the harbour the\r\nchains were made fast across the mouth and they were trapped. On land he\r\nnow found himself between two hostile forces; for C\xc3\xa6sar with Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconnivance had landed at Pelusium and was marching on Alexandria, and\r\nGallus was attacking him from Par\xc3\xa6tonium. He once more executed one\r\nof those rapid movements for which he was famous. Hastening back to\r\nAlexandria he flung his cavalry upon C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s vanguard when tired with its\r\nmarch. But the success of this movement encouraged him to make a general\r\nattack, in which he was decisively beaten. His last resource, the ships\r\nstill remaining in the harbour of Alexandria, failed him. Acting under\r\nCleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s orders the captains refused to receive him. The queen, it is\r\nsaid, had shut herself up in the Tomb-house or Ptolem\xc3\xa6um, hoping to drive\r\nAntony to despair and suicide, as the only solution of the difficulty. If\r\nthat was indeed her motive, she was both successful and repentant. Antony\r\nstabbed himself, and begged to be carried to the Tomb-house, where he\r\ndied in her arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Cleopatra.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar was now eager to secure Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s person. He sent Gallus to her\r\nwith soothing messages, which he delivered to her at the porch. But while\r\nhe was speaking with her C. Proculeius entered by a window, seized the\r\nqueen, and conveyed her to the Palace, where she was allowed her usual\r\nattendants and all the paraphernalia of royalty. Of the two accounts of\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s interview with her the more picturesque one is given by the\r\nusually prosaic Dio. He found her looking charming in her mourning,\r\nsurrounded by likenesses of various kinds of the great Iulius, and in\r\nthe bosom of her dress a packet of letters received from him. On his\r\nentrance she rose with a blush and greeted him as her lord and master.\r\nShe pleaded that Iulius had always honoured her and acknowledged her as\r\nqueen. She read affectionate passages from his letters, which she kissed\r\npassionately with tears streaming from her eyes, being at the same time\r\ncareful to put respectful admiration and affection for C\xc3\xa6sar himself into\r\nher looks and the tone of her voice. C\xc3\xa6sar quite appreciated the drama\r\nthus played for his behoof, but feigned unconsciousness, keeping his\r\neyes fixed on the ground and saying nothing but: \xe2\x80\x9cCourage, madam! Do not\r\nbe alarmed, for no harm will happen to you.\xe2\x80\x9d He said no word, however,\r\nas to her retention of royal power, nor did his voice betray the least\r\ntenderness. In an agony of disappointment she flung herself at his feet\r\nand besought him by the memory of his father to allow her to die and\r\nshare Antony\xe2\x80\x99s tomb. C\xc3\xa6sar made no reply except once more to bid her not\r\nbe alarmed; but he gave orders that though allowed her usual attendants\r\nshe was to be closely watched. Cleopatra understood only too well that\r\nthe intention was to take her to Rome that she might adorn the victor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntriumph. But in order to secure greater freedom she feigned submission\r\nand to be busied in collecting presents to take to Livia. Having thus\r\ndiminished the vigilance of Epaphroditus and her other guards, she some\r\ndays afterwards made a parade of writing a letter to C\xc3\xa6sar, which she\r\ninduced Epaphroditus to convey. When he returned, however, he found\r\nthe queen, decked in royal robes, lying dead with two of her waiting\r\nwomen dead or dying by her side. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows for certain,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dio,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow she died. Some say that a venomous snake was conveyed to her in a\r\nwater-vessel or in some flowers. Others that the long pin with which\r\nshe fastened her hair had a poisoned point, with which she pricked her\r\narm.\xe2\x80\x9d Plutarch, with a like expression of doubt, says that the snake was\r\nconveyed in a basket of figs; and that on receiving the letter brought\r\nby Epaphroditus C\xc3\xa6sar understood her purpose and hurried to the Palace\r\nto prevent it, and even summoned some of the mysterious Psylli\xe2\x80\x94snake\r\ncharmers and curers\xe2\x80\x94to suck out the poison.[213] But in spite of his\r\ndisappointment, he admired her spirit and gave her a royal funeral.\r\nPerhaps after all he felt relieved of a difficulty. According to Plutarch\r\nshe had shown him that she was not to be easily managed. At the end of\r\nher conversation with C\xc3\xa6sar, he says, she handed him a schedule of the\r\nroyal treasures. But when one of her stewards or treasurers remarked\r\nthat she was keeping back certain sums, the enraged queen sprang up,\r\nclutched his hair, and beat his face with her fists. When C\xc3\xa6sar smiled\r\nand tried to pacify her, she exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cA pretty thing, C\xc3\xa6sar, that you\r\nshould visit and address me with honour in my fallen state, and that one\r\nof my own slaves should malign me! If I have set apart certain women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nornaments, it was not for myself, but for Octavia and Livia, that they\r\nmight soften your heart to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasanter if the death of Cleopatra and the confiscation of\r\nher treasury were the end of the story. But the executions of the two\r\npoor boys, C\xc3\xa6sarion and Antyllus, were acts of cold-blooded cruelty.\r\nThe former, who could not have been more than sixteen, had been sent by\r\nhis mother with a large supply of money to \xc3\x86thiopia, but was betrayed\r\nby his _p\xc3\xa6dagogus_, overtaken by C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers, and put to death.\r\nThe young Antonius (or Antyllus) begged hard for his life, and fled for\r\nsafety to the _heroum_ of the divine Iulius, constructed by Cleopatra,\r\nbut was dragged away and killed. He could at most have been no more\r\nthan fourteen, and had in childhood been betrothed to C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s infant\r\ndaughter, Iulia. Perhaps the pretensions of C\xc3\xa6sarion to the paternity of\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, and his acknowledgment as heir to the throne of Egypt, made his\r\ndeath inevitable; but the extreme youth of Antyllus and his helplessness\r\nmight have pleaded for him. The rest of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s children were protected\r\nby Octavia, and brought up as became their rank.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to feel some sympathy for Antony, who had thus flung\r\naway fame and life for a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love. But it was doubtless a happy thing\r\nfor the world that the direction of affairs fell to the cautious Augustus\r\nrather than to him. He had some attractive qualities, but no virtues.\r\nBoundless self-indulgence in a ruler more than outweighs good-nature or\r\nliberality. It brings more suffering to subjects than the occasional\r\ngratification caused by the latter qualities can compensate. His scheme\r\nfor erecting a series of semi-independent kingdoms in the East would\r\nalmost certainly have been the cause of endless troubles. He was not more\r\nthan fifty-three at his death, but there were signs of a great decay of\r\nenergy and activity. The people thought of him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAs of a Prince whose manhood was all gone,\r\n    And molten down in mere uxoriousness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd undoubtedly, if instead of spending a winter in Samos in luxury and\r\nriot and part of another at Athens in much the same way, he had begun his\r\nattack on C\xc3\xa6sar a year earlier, the result might have been different. But\r\nhe let the occasion slip and found, as others have done, that the head of\r\nTime is bald at the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Obv.: Head of Augustus.

It has been called a _dyarchy_, the two parties to it being the\r\nEmperor and the Senate. They were not, however, at any time of equal\r\npower. As far as it was possible Augustus rested his various functions on\r\nthe same foundation as those of the Republican magistrates, and treated\r\nthe Senate with studious respect. But in spite of all professions,\r\nin spite even of himself, he became a monarch, whose will was only\r\nlimited by those forces of circumstance and sentiment to which the most\r\nautocratic of sovereigns have at times been forced to bow. The important\r\nepochs in this reconstruction are the years B.C. 29, 27, 23; but it will\r\nbe necessary sometimes to anticipate the course of events and to speak at\r\nonce of what often took many years to develop.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reduction of the army.]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the vast armaments which the various phases of the civil\r\nwar had called into existence was made possible by the wealth which the\r\npossession of Egypt put into C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Though Egypt became a Roman\r\nprovince it was from the first in a peculiar position, governed by a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprefect\xe2\x80\x9d appointed by the Emperor, who took as his private property\r\nboth the treasures and domain lands of the Ptolemaic kings and the\r\nbalance of the revenues over the expenses. This formed the nucleus of\r\nwhat was afterwards called the _fiscus_,[214] the imperial revenue as\r\ndistinguished from the _\xc3\xa6rarium_ or public treasury. He was thus enabled\r\nto disband many legions at once, without the dangerous discontent of the\r\nveterans, or the irritation of fresh confiscations. It was imperatively\r\nnecessary to do this if he wished to avoid the dangers which had so often\r\nthreatened the State from leaders of overgrown military forces. The\r\nnumber of legions under arms during the preceding ten years was indeed\r\nformidable. In B.C. 36, when C\xc3\xa6sar took over those of Lepidus and Sextus\r\nPompeius, he had forty-four or forty-five legions under his command.[215]\r\nBetween that time and the war with Antony he had reduced the number to\r\neighteen. But after the victory at Actium and the death of Antony, the\r\nlegions taken over from him, along with those newly raised for the war,\r\nagain amounted to fifty. Therefore C\xc3\xa6sar had twice to deal with a body of\r\nabout 250,000 men. He says himself that in the course of his wars half a\r\nmillion citizens had taken the military oath to him. The wealth of Egypt\r\nserved to purchase lands or compensate towns for such as were taken for\r\nthe veterans. From first to last more than 300,000 men were provided for\r\nin this way.[216] An important purpose also served by this measure was\r\nthe repeopling of Italy and the renovation of many towns which during\r\nthe civil wars, or from other causes, had fallen into decay. Republican\r\nprecedent was followed by recalling the ancient practice of settling\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccolonies\xe2\x80\x9d in the Italian towns, but with this difference, that the new\r\ncolonists were usually treated as a _supplementum_ of an already existing\r\ncolonia, lands being purchased for them from private owners or from the\r\ncommunities. Augustus claims twenty-eight of such Italian colonies, of\r\nwhich thirteen are known to have been in past times \xe2\x80\x9cRoman\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLatin\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncolonies. Other towns, besides a money compensation, were rewarded by\r\nbeing raised to the status of a colony, generally with the addition of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIulia\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAugusta\xe2\x80\x9d to their name. This system was presently extended\r\nbeyond Italy\xe2\x80\x94to Africa, Spain, Sicily, Illyricum, Macedonia, Achaia,\r\nGallia Narbonensis, Asia, Syria, and Pisidia. Settlements in these\r\ncountries were all colonies of veterans, except Dyrrachium, which was\r\nfilled with dispossessed Italians. This was not altogether a novelty:\r\nfor extra-Italian colonies had been already established in Cisalpine and\r\nTransalpine Gaul, at Carthage, and at Corinth. Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar is said to\r\nhave settled 80,000 citizens in this way outside Italy. The extra-Italic\r\ncolonies of Augustus, however, differed from these last in regard to\r\nstatus. They had what was called _Latinitas_, that is, citizenship\r\nwithout the right of voting or holding office at Rome. In virtue of this\r\ncitizenship they came under the Roman law and belonged to the assize\r\n(_conventus_) of the provincial governors. Some of them, again, had the\r\nspecial privileges which were summed up in the general term \xe2\x80\x9cItalic\r\nright\xe2\x80\x9d (_ius Italicum_), and included freedom from the jurisdiction\r\nof the provincial governor (_libertas_), and exemption from tribute\r\n(_immunitas_). The general aim seems to have been to put the extra-Italic\r\ncolonies as far as possible in the same position as those in Italy. As\r\na rule also the veterans settled in a colony had been enlisted in the\r\nprovince, and had, therefore, already local connections. Augustus took\r\ntrouble in fostering and adorning these towns, whether in Italy or the\r\nprovinces, and records with pride that many had become populous cities\r\nduring his lifetime. In many cases their subsequent importance shewed\r\nthat they had been well selected. Thus Carthage had a great medi\xc3\xa6val\r\nhistory; Durazzo and Philippi were long places of consequence; Saragossa,\r\nMerida, Cordova, Aix, Patras, Beyroot, all trace their prosperity to the\r\ncolonisation of Augustus.[217]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Improvements at Rome.]\r\n\r\nNor did he meanwhile forget to encourage restoration at Rome, to which\r\nhe had already given a strong impulse. Nothing had damaged Antony in the\r\neyes of the Romans more than the report of his intention to transfer the\r\nseat of Empire to Alexandria. A similar report as to the establishment\r\nof an imperial city for the East at Ilium caused a like uneasiness a few\r\nyears later, which found expression in one of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s most spirited\r\nodes.[218] C\xc3\xa6sar prudently shewed not only that he held firmly by the\r\nImperial position of Rome, but that he also wished to make it externally\r\nworthy to be the capital of the world. As in all his projects, no one\r\nco-operated more loyally than Agrippa. But others also were pressed\r\ninto the service; and those especially who had earned triumphs were\r\nencouraged to use a portion at least of their spoils in public works. In\r\nthe next few years there was a great outburst of temple restoration,[219]\r\nand it became the fashion among the immediate friends and followers of\r\nAugustus to signalise their tenure of office or a military success by\r\nundertaking some important building. Horace again has reflected the view\r\nof such matters which the official classes were expected to take, and\r\nperhaps to a certain extent did take. The sufferings of the Romans in the\r\nrevolutionary period had undoubtedly been great. The ruinous state of the\r\ntemples was doubtless connected with the unsettled times\xe2\x80\x94whether as cause\r\nor consequence, who could exactly say? It was not unnatural to suppose\r\nthat among the other _delicta maiorum_ this too had moved the wrath of\r\nthe gods. At any rate moral laxity went side by side with scepticism\r\nand neglect of religious observances. Nor need we regard either poet or\r\nemperor as a monster of hypocrisy in supporting such a doctrine. Habit\r\nand tradition are stronger than philosophy. There always remains the\r\nIncalculable after all our reasoning; and many to-day regret the decay\r\nof religious sentiment as a public misfortune, who are yet profoundly\r\nuncertain as to what they in truth believe themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honours bestowed on C\xc3\xa6sar, B.C. 30-27.]\r\n\r\nOn his return from Asia and Greece, where he had spent the winter and\r\nspring of B.C. 30-29, C\xc3\xa6sar was received with enthusiasm by all classes.\r\nSolemn sacrifice was offered by the consul in the name of the people, and\r\nevery honour which the Senate could bestow was awaiting his acceptance.\r\nThose voted after Actium were lavishly increased in September B.C.\r\n30, on the news of Antony\xe2\x80\x99s death and the occupation of Alexandria.\r\nTwo triumphal arches were to be erected, one at Rome and another at\r\nBrundisium;[220] the temple of the divine Iulius was to be adorned with\r\nthe prows of captured ships; his own birthday, the day of the victory at\r\nActium, and that of the entry into Alexandria were to be for ever sacred;\r\nthe Vestal Virgins and the whole people were to meet him on his return in\r\nsolemn procession; he was to have the foremost seat at all festivals; and\r\nwas to celebrate three triumphs\xe2\x80\x94one for the victory over the Dalmatian\r\nand neighbouring tribes, a second for Actium, and a third for Egypt.\r\nThe _tribunicia potestas_ for life had again been voted to him with\r\nthe right of exercising it within a mile radius beyond the walls. He\r\nwas to have the right to hear all cases on appeal and to have a casting\r\nvote in all courts. His name was to be mentioned in public prayers for\r\nthe state. On the 1st of January, B.C. 29, all his _acta_ had been\r\nconfirmed; and when it became known that the Parthians had referred a\r\ndisputed succession to the throne to his arbitration, some fresh honours\r\nwere devised. The disasters under Crassus and Antony had made the Romans\r\nparticularly sensitive in regard to the Parthians; and this apparent\r\nacknowledgment by them of a superiority attaching to Augustus, however\r\nindefinite, was represented by the court party and the court poets, not\r\nonly as a veritable triumph over the Parthians, but as a step in a career\r\nof Eastern conquest of almost unlimited extent.[221] Accordingly his\r\nname was now to be coupled with those of the gods in hymns; a tribe was\r\nnamed _Iulia_ in his honour; he was to wear the chaplet of victory in\r\nall assemblies; and to nominate as many members as he chose to all the\r\nsacred colleges. C\xc3\xa6sar accepted most of these honours, but begged to be\r\nexcused the procession on his return. This was an honour which he always\r\navoided if he could, preferring to enter the city quietly by night. It\r\nwas no doubt a trying ordeal at the end of a long journey, and he may\r\nhave felt like Cromwell that a larger crowd still would have come out to\r\nsee him hanged. The three triumphs, however, were now celebrated with the\r\ngreatest splendour, especially the third over Egypt, in which a figure of\r\nthe dead queen lying upon a couch, with son and daughter beside her, was\r\na prominent feature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The increase of the Patriciate and the Census.]\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar now had ample powers for every purpose of government. The\r\n_tribunicia potestas_ in itself gave him legislative initiative and\r\ncontrol over other departments. It was afterwards regarded as the most\r\nimportant of his powers. But in his first measures of reform he availed\r\nhimself rather of his powers as consul. The consulship was to be really,\r\nas it always remained nominally, the chief state office, combining all\r\nthe prerogatives once centred in the _rex_. Thus in holding the Census of\r\nB.C. 28 he acted as Consul with his colleague Agrippa, exercising indeed\r\na _censoria potestas_, though not one formally bestowed, but as inherent\r\nin the consulship.[222] He concluded it with the solemn _lustrum_, which\r\nhad not been performed for forty-two years, the last Censors (B.C. 50)\r\nhaving apparently been prevented from performing this solemnity by the\r\noutbreak of civil war. The Census was made the occasion of a reform\r\nin the _ordines_ and especially of the Senate. In the first place, he\r\nrecruited the dwindling number of patrician _gentes_ by raising certain\r\nplebeian families to the patriciate, as his own family had been raised\r\nby Iulius in B.C. 45 in virtue of a _lex Cassia_. The same power was now\r\naccorded to him by a law proposed by L. S\xc3\xa6nius, who was consul during the\r\nlast two months of B.C. 30. The object seems to have been to preserve a\r\nkind of nobility, which at the same time should have certain political\r\ndisabilities. The patricians, indeed, still had the exclusive right of\r\nbeing appointed to certain religious offices, but, on the other hand,\r\nthey were debarred from the tribuneship and the plebeian \xc3\xa6dileship,[223]\r\nthe two offices in which a man by legislative proposals or lavish\r\nexpenditure might make himself politically conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lectiones Senatus.]\r\n\r\nA similar desire to restore the ancient order of the State prompted his\r\nreformation of the Senate. The powers of this body had always been great\r\nprecisely because they were not defined by law; and by associating it\r\nwith himself he would gain all the advantages of this indefiniteness and\r\nprestige, while really keeping full control of it. Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar had made\r\nthe mistake of treating it with studied disrespect, and his chief enemies\r\nwere within its walls. The Triumvirs, though in reality despotic, had\r\nlooked to it to give their _acta_ an outward show of legality. Thus on\r\nOctavian\xe2\x80\x99s demand it had condemned Q. Gallius in B.C. 43, and Salvidienus\r\nin B.C. 40, for treason. It had confirmed the triumviral _acta_ en bloc,\r\ngiving Antony charge of the Parthian war and ratifying his arrangements\r\nin the East in advance. It had voted triumphs and other honours to the\r\ntriumvirs and their agents. It was the Senate that in B.C. 41 voted L.\r\nAntonius an _hostis_, that in B.C. 32 decreed war against Cleopatra,\r\ndeposed Antony from consulship and imperium, and in B.C. 31-30 voted the\r\nvarious honours and powers to the victorious C\xc3\xa6sar. The late civil war\r\nhad in a way made the importance of the Senate more prominent. So many\r\nSenators had joined Antony at Alexandria that, like Sertorius in Spain\r\nand Pompey in Epirus, he had professed to have the Senate with him.\r\nThe victory of Actium had pricked that bubble, and the Senate at Rome\r\nremained the only Senate of the Empire. C\xc3\xa6sar was wise to put himself\r\nunder the \xc3\xa6gis of this ancient and still respected body. But it was\r\nnecessary to secure its dignity and effectiveness, which had suffered\r\nin various ways during the revolutionary period. Among other things its\r\nnumbers had been swollen and often with men of inferior social standing.\r\nIulius Cesar had filled it with his creatures\xe2\x80\x94provincials from Gaul\r\nand Spain, sons of freedmen, centurions, soldiers, and peregrini\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nthat a pasquinade was put up by some wit that \xe2\x80\x9cno one was to show a new\r\nSenator the way to the Senate House.\xe2\x80\x9d[224] Another batch of Senators was\r\nintroduced after C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s death, chiefly by Antony, in virtue of real or\r\nfictitious entries found in C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s papers, whom the populace nicknamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpost-mortem Senators\xe2\x80\x9d (_Senatores orcini_),[225] or sometimes even\r\non their own initiative without any other formality than assuming the\r\nlaticlave and senatorial shoe.[226] Many Senators no doubt perished in\r\nthe proscriptions, in the subsequent battles of Philippi and Perusia, and\r\nin the contests with Sextus Pompeius, but the Triumvirs appear to have\r\nbeen lavish in enrolling new members without regard to fortune, origin,\r\nor official position; and so careless were they in this matter that cases\r\nare recorded of unenfranchised slaves having obtained office and seats in\r\nthe Senate and being then recognised and claimed by their masters.[227]\r\nThe result was that at the time of the battle of Actium there were more\r\nthan a thousand Senators.[228] This was too large a number for practical\r\nwork, without taking into consideration inferiority of character. No\r\ndoubt a good many who had sided with Antony disappeared in various ways;\r\nbut in now making a formal _lectio_ C\xc3\xa6sar resolved to reduce the number\r\nstill more. Sixty voluntarily resigned and were allowed to retain the\r\npurple and certain social distinctions, but a hundred and forty were\r\nsimply omitted from the new list. By this means the roll was reduced\r\nto about six hundred, which continued to be the number in subsequent\r\nlectiones.\r\n\r\nTo secure their attendance and to prevent interference in the provinces\r\nthe regulation was enforced which prohibited any Senator from leaving\r\nItaly (except for Sicily or Gallia Narbonensis) unless he had imperium\r\nor was on a legatio,[229] that is, practically, unless he was serving\r\nthe state in some way on C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. In the next _lectio_ (B.C.\r\n19) Augustus tried an elaborate system of co-option, by nominating\r\nthirty on the existing roll, each of whom were to name five who were\r\nto draw lots for admission, and so on till the number was made up.\r\nBut finding that it was not worked fairly he stopped this and made up\r\nthe roll himself. This continued to be the system, but as time went on\r\nthe difficulty was not so much to exclude unworthy men as to induce\r\nenough of the right sort to serve. Membership became less attractive\r\nas the imperial power developed, and the holding of profitable offices\r\ndepended on the will of the Emperor, who was not bound to select from\r\nthe Senate. Moreover, a property qualification was now required. None\r\nhad existed under the republic by definite law, though a certain\r\nfortune was regarded as practically necessary; and as the Senate was\r\nrecruited from the _ordo equester_, a minimum was in the last century\r\nof the republic automatically secured. C\xc3\xa6sar fixed 800,000 sesterces,\r\nand later on a million sesterces as the Senatorial fortune, though in\r\ncases of special fitness he gave grants to enable men to maintain their\r\nposition. Still the honour of membership was not found to make up for\r\nits disabilities\xe2\x80\x94the difficulty of going abroad and the prohibition as\r\nto engaging in commerce. In B.C. 13 Augustus was obliged to compel men\r\nwho had the property qualification to serve. Even then the attendance\r\nwas so slack that in B.C. 11 the old quorum of four hundred was reduced.\r\nIn B.C. 9 various regulations were introduced to facilitate business,\r\nsuch as the publication of an order of the day (\xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xcf\x8d\xce\xba\xcf\x89\xce\xbc\xce\xb1), fixed days\r\nof meeting, a variation as to the quorum required for different kinds\r\nof business, a scale of fines for non-attendance, the selection by lot\r\nof thirty-five Senators to attend during September and October, and an\r\nextension to the pr\xc3\xa6tors of the power of bringing business before the\r\nhouse. Towards the end of the life of Augustus, when his age made it\r\ntoo much of an exertion to meet the full Senate, a committee of sixteen\r\nSenators was selected by lot to confer with him at his own house. The\r\ninevitable consequence was that this small committee practically settled\r\nmost questions, which only came formally before the whole body, whose\r\nadministrative function was farther lessened by the diminished importance\r\nof the _\xc3\xa6rarium_ as compared with the imperial treasury or _fiscus_.\r\nFinally, it lost the right of coining silver, retaining only the bronze.\r\nOn the whole, then, the tendency was towards restricting the functions\r\nof the Senate and making membership less attractive. But this does not\r\nappear to have been the original design of Augustus. He habitually\r\naddressed it with respect, referred all his powers to its confirmation,\r\nand took it into his confidence on imperial affairs. He revived the\r\nancient dignity of _princeps Senatus_\xe2\x80\x94in abeyance since the death of\r\nCicero\xe2\x80\x94and held that rank himself all his life. Certain of the provinces\r\nwere still left to its management, and cases of _majestas_ were referred\r\nto its decision. The publication of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s _acta_ had originated\r\nwith Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar (B.C. 59), who was not likely to have done anything to\r\nenhance its prestige. The prohibition of this publication by Augustus\r\nwas perhaps intended partly to protect the proceedings from criticism,\r\npartly to emphasise the fact that the Senate shared with him the intimate\r\nsecrets of government which it was not for the public advantage to have\r\ngenerally known. The effect, however, was not good; what could not be\r\nascertained with exactness from official sources was often misrepresented\r\nby irresponsible rumour, and one of the early measures of Tiberius was to\r\nreverse this order.[230]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The end of the anarchy.]\r\n\r\nWith a Senate purified by his first _lectio_ C\xc3\xa6sar felt that the\r\nconstitution might in form, at any rate, be restored. But first the\r\nend of the revolutionary period had to be marked. On January 11, B.C.\r\n29, the temple of Ianus was closed, for the first time since B.C. 235,\r\nfor the third time in all Roman history. It was still shut when C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nreturned from Asia, and on the 1st of January, B.C. 28, the _augurium\r\nsalutis_ was taken. This ceremony\xe2\x80\x94ascertaining by augury whether prayers\r\nfor the people should be offered to Salus\xe2\x80\x94could only be performed in\r\ntime of complete peace. At the same time a single edict annulled all\r\nthe _acta_ of the triumvirs, which were to have no force from his sixth\r\nconsulship (B.C. 28).[231] The constitutional significance of this will\r\nbe best seen by recalling some facts as to the triumvirs. Whether its\r\n_acta_ were good or bad, the triumvirate was in itself a suspension of\r\nthe constitution. Established by a _lex_ on the 27th of November, B.C.\r\n43, to hold office till the 31st of December, B.C. 38, its authority\r\nhad been renewed in the course of B.C. 37 to the 31st of December, B.C.\r\n33, whether by another _lex_ or by the will of the triumvirs themselves\r\nis a moot point.[232] But, however appointed, the triumvirs were like\r\ndictators in superseding all other magistrates, and more powerful\r\nthan dictators from the length of their tenure of office, and because\r\nthe terms of their appointment (_reipublic\xc3\xa6 constituend\xc3\xa6 causa_) gave\r\nthem absolute legislative powers. They could abolish, modify, or grant\r\ndispensation from existing laws. Their edicts had the force of laws, and\r\nsuch laws as were passed in the regular way during their office either\r\nconfirmed their powers, or were passed at their desire to give formal\r\npermanence to their edicts. They had complete control of elections, and\r\nagreed between themselves as to the nomination of magistrates, often\r\nfor several years in advance. They controlled the treasury, the domain\r\nlands, the raising or removal of taxation in Rome and Italy. They divided\r\namong themselves the command of the military forces and the government\r\nof the provinces. Each of them, personally or by a legatus, exercised\r\nimperial powers in the provinces assigned to him; set up or put down\r\nclient kings; granted immunities or freedom to cities, or abolished\r\nthem; bestowed or withdrew the citizenship of individuals; waged war\r\nwith surrounding nations; raised or remitted taxation. At Rome also they\r\nhad exercised the right of summoning, consulting, and presiding over\r\nthe Senate, of vetoing the motion of other Senators, but without being\r\nsubject to the tribunician veto themselves. To abolish the _acta_ of\r\nsuch a despotic body might with reason be regarded a considerable step\r\ntowards a restoration of the constitution. Even if some of his own _acta_\r\nwere thereby abolished, C\xc3\xa6sar would have no difficulty in re-enacting\r\nthem if desirable. The point was to abolish the memory of a period of\r\nunconstitutional government, to prevent its enactments remaining as\r\nprecedents or grounds of claim by citizen or subject, and to leave the\r\nfield open for the new arrangement which C\xc3\xa6sar wished men to regard as\r\na restoration of the republic. For he had already conceived a plan, in\r\nvirtue of which the people, magistrates, and Senate should resume their\r\nold functions, while he himself should be practically the colleague of\r\nthe higher magistrates\xe2\x80\x94endowed with their powers, though not necessarily\r\nwith their office\xe2\x80\x94and thereby practically direct the policy of the state.\r\nThe key to the policy\xe2\x80\x94as he wished it to be regarded\xe2\x80\x94is contained in\r\nhis own comment: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that time (January 1, 27) I was superior to all\r\nin rank, but of power I had no more than my colleagues in the several\r\noffices.\xe2\x80\x9d[233] There were some of his powers difficult to reconcile with\r\nthis theory of a restored constitution; but he was careful to rest these\r\non votes of the people or Senate, to accept them only for fixed periods,\r\nor to profess to share them with his colleagues.[234]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inauguration of the new constitution, 1 January, B.C. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe new constitution was now introduced in a characteristic scene,\r\napparently designed to make it clear that C\xc3\xa6sar did not seek power,\r\nbut undertook it under pressure. In a meeting of the Senate, at the\r\nbeginning of his seventh consulship, he delivered from a written copy\r\na carefully prepared speech, in which he surrendered to the Senate\r\nall the powers which it had bestowed upon him, as well as those which\r\nhe had acquired in any other way\xe2\x80\x94the command of troops, the powers of\r\nlegislation, the government of the provinces. He based his resolution\r\non justice, the inherent right of the people to manage its own affairs,\r\nand on his own right to consult for his personal safety, health, and\r\nease. At the same time, he dwelt on his public services and those of his\r\nadoptive father, the labours they had both endured, the dangers to which\r\nboth had been exposed, and justified the exercise up to this time of his\r\nvarious powers. Finally, he urged them to refrain from innovations, to\r\ngive a hearty obedience to the laws, to elect the best men for civil and\r\nmilitary offices without prejudice or favouritism, to deal honestly with\r\npublic money, to treat allies and subjects equitably, to seek no wars but\r\nto be prepared for any, and to see that he had no cause to regret his\r\nrenunciation of power. The speech was received with loud remonstrances,\r\nsome sincere and some perhaps cautious and time-serving, but so general\r\nthat he had to consent with real or feigned reluctance to receive back\r\nhis autocratic powers. Was he merely playing a part, or had he any real\r\nwish to retire from public life? As in most cases there was probably a\r\ndivision of feeling in his heart. He was in weak health, and had had\r\nanother illness a few months before. For eighteen years\xe2\x80\x94just half his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94he had been ceaselessly engaged in fatiguing duties, in wars for\r\nwhich he had no genius, and in civil administration which, though much\r\nbetter suited to his taste and abilities, had been carried out amidst\r\nconstant opposition and difficulty. One side of his mind may well have\r\nbeen eager for rest. But, on the other hand, no man who has tasted power\r\nand feels that he can wield it quits it without pain. At no time did\r\nhe find pleasure in the outward trappings of state, or in the personal\r\nindulgences for which it gives opportunity, but he was ambitious in the\r\nbest sense. He loved his country and desired to be remembered as the\r\nrestorer of its prosperity and happiness, as the benefactor of the Empire\r\nand the guarantee of its peace and good government. Twenty-four years\r\nlater when Valerius Messalla, speaking in the name of people and Senate,\r\ngreeted him with the affectionate title of \xe2\x80\x9cFather of his country,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nburst into tears and could only murmur that he had nothing more to pray\r\nfor except to retain their affection to the end of his life. But whatever\r\nsecret wish he may have had for rest he must have known that it was\r\nimpossible. The elements of disorder and oppression were not destroyed.\r\nIf the restraining hand were removed they would break out into new\r\nactivity. Nor would it be safe for himself after years of steady working\r\nfor this end, in the course of which he must have offended countless\r\ninterests, to trust himself to a new generation of statesmen without the\r\nexperience in the working of a free state possessed by their ancestors,\r\nand yet with the same passions and ambitions. A scheme had, in fact,\r\nbeen elaborated in conjunction with his faithful friends and ministers,\r\nAgrippa and M\xc3\xa6cenas. Dio represents the former as urging C\xc3\xa6sar to\r\nwithdraw from power and frankly to restore the republic. He grounded his\r\nadvice on the financial and political difficulties which he would have\r\nto face, on the uncertainty of his own health, on the impossibility of\r\ndrawing back hereafter and the evil destiny of all those who in previous\r\nages had attempted to gain absolute power. M\xc3\xa6cenas, on the other hand,\r\nnot only urged him to retain his power, but went into most elaborate\r\ndetails as to the arrangements which it would be necessary to make. He\r\ndid not deny the risks, but maintained that the glory was worth them,\r\nand that a withdrawal was neither safe for himself nor for the people.\r\nIt is not clear how far we may regard these two speeches, as well as\r\nthat of Augustus in the Senate, as representing what was really said. It\r\nis possible that as they were all written documents they may have been\r\npreserved, and that Dio is translating from them; but at any rate they\r\nrepresent fairly well the two sides of the question which Augustus must\r\nhave considered with care and anxiety.[235]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Division of the Provinces, B.C. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement actually made was of the nature of a compromise. The\r\nprovinces were divided, as formerly between Antony and C\xc3\xa6sar, so now\r\nbetween C\xc3\xa6sar and the Senate. Those that required considerable military\r\nforces were to be under C\xc3\xa6sar, governed by his deputies with the rank\r\nof pr\xc3\xa6tor (_legati pro pr\xc3\xa6tore_), appointed by his sole authority, and\r\nholding office during his pleasure. The rest were to be still governed\r\nby proconsuls, selected as of old by ballot under the superintendence of\r\nthe Senate from the ex-pr\xc3\xa6tors or ex-consuls, subject to the existing\r\nlaws as to length of tenure and the obligation of furnishing accounts,\r\nand liable with their staff to prosecution _de rebus repetundis_ in the\r\nordinary courts. The \xe2\x80\x9cprimacy\xe2\x80\x9d of the Emperor, however, was apparent in\r\nthis partnership with the Senate, no less than in that with colleagues\r\nin office. In the allotment of Senatorial provinces he retained the\r\nright of nominating the exact number required, so that no one of whom\r\nhe disapproved could obtain a province. In both classes of province he\r\nappointed a procurator, with authority over the finances independent\r\nof the proconsul or legatus.[236] In both also the governor received a\r\nsalary fixed by himself, and had to conform to certain general principles\r\nlaid down by him. In all alike he possessed a _majus imperium_, soon\r\nafterwards, if not at first, defined as a _proconsulare imperium_.[237]\r\n\r\nFor the rest he retained his right of being yearly elected consul, his\r\ntribunician power, his membership of the sacred colleges, his command of\r\nthe army. But freedom of election was ostensibly restored to the people,\r\nand the Senate was still the fountain of honour, and had the control\r\nof the _\xc3\xa6rarium_. But this last was no longer managed by two elected\r\nqu\xc3\xa6stors, but by two men of pr\xc3\xa6torian rank, nominated by the Emperor.\r\nIt was, moreover, now of minor importance, as the _fiscus_ (to use the\r\nlater term) was entirely in the hands of C\xc3\xa6sar, and into it went the\r\nrevenues of the imperial provinces, and, above all, of Egypt. The key\r\nof the position was that though the old republican magistrates still\r\nexisted, C\xc3\xa6sar in various ways was their colleague, and of course the\r\npredominant partner. The Senate, however, accepted his view of the case,\r\nas afterwards expressed in the _Monumentum_, that he had \xe2\x80\x9ctransferred\r\nthe republic from his power to the authority of the Senate and people\r\nof Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d To show their confidence in him the Senators voted him a\r\nbodyguard (the men drawing double pay), and confirmed his authority in\r\nthe provinces. The latter, which made him _princeps_ throughout the\r\nEmpire, as he already was in Rome, he refused to accept for more than\r\nten years. But it was always renewed subsequently for periods of five or\r\nten years; and when in B.C. 23, the _proconsulare imperium_ was declared\r\nto be operative within, as well as beyond, the pom\xc3\xa6rium, he had, in fact,\r\nsupreme control, military and financial, in all parts of the Empire. To\r\nmark his exceptional position without offending the prejudice against\r\nroyalty, it was desired to give him a special title of honour. His own\r\nwish was for \xe2\x80\x9cRomulus,\xe2\x80\x9d as second founder of the state. But objection was\r\nraised to it as recalling the odious position of _rex_, and he eventually\r\naccepted the title of AUGUSTUS, a word connected with religion and the\r\nscience of augury, and thereby suggesting the kind of sentiment which\r\nhe desired to be attached to his person and genius. This was voted by\r\nthe Senate on the Ides (13th) of January, B.C. 27, and confirmed by a\r\nplebiscitum on the 16th. He was now \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d or _princeps_ everywhere,\r\nwhether in the Senate, or among his colleagues in the offices, or among\r\nthe proconsuls in the provinces.[238] He was, therefore, spoken of as\r\n_princeps_ in ordinary language, and the word gradually hardened into a\r\ntitle. It exactly suited the view which he himself wished to be taken\r\nof his political position, as giving a primacy of rank among colleagues\r\nof equal _legal_ powers; though, of course, a primacy, supported by the\r\npower of the purse and the sword, made him a master while masquerading\r\nas a colleague. He, however, adopted the word as rightly expressing his\r\nposition without giving needless offence, and his successors took it as a\r\nmatter of course, though it less frequently occurs in inscriptions than\r\ntheir other titles.[239]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the bestowal of the title Augustus was another\r\nvote of the Senate, that the front of his house should not only be\r\nadorned with the laurels that told of victory over his enemies, but also\r\nwith the oaken or \xe2\x80\x9ccivic\xe2\x80\x9d crown which told of the lives of citizens\r\npreserved. This appears again and again on his coins with the legend\xe2\x80\x94_ob\r\ncives servatos_: and it is mentioned by Augustus himself at the end of\r\nhis record of achievements, as though\xe2\x80\x94with the later title of Pater\r\nPatri\xc3\xa6\xe2\x80\x94it indicated the chief glory of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PRINCIPATUS, B.C. 27-23\r\n\r\n    _Serves iturum C\xc3\xa6sarem in ultimos_\r\n    _orbis Britannos et invenum recens_\r\n    _examen Eois timendum_\r\n    _partibus Oceanoque rubro._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gaul and Britain.]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of his official status at Rome left Augustus free to turn\r\nto other parts of the Empire. He had spent the greater part of two years\r\nafter the victory at Actium in organising the East. His face was now\r\nturned northward and westward. In the spring of B.C. 27, he set out for\r\nGaul to reorganise the provinces won by Iulius in B.C. 58-49, and farther\r\nsecured by the operations of Agrippa in B.C. 37 and Messalla in B.C.\r\n29. It was understood that he meant also to cross to Britain, and the\r\ncourt poets are dutifully anxious as to the dangers he will incur, and\r\nprophetically certain of the victories he will win. A British expedition\r\nhad been for some years floating in Roman minds. It is true that Iulius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar had invaded the island and imposed a tribute on some of the tribes.\r\nBut the tribute does not seem to have been paid. The Briton was still\r\n_intactus_, and was classed with the Parthian as a danger to the frontier\r\nof the Empire.[240] He was chiefly known at Rome by the presence of\r\ncertain stalwart slaves, and by the determination he displayed not to\r\nadmit adventurous Roman merchants.[241] But, after all, Augustus found\r\nenough to do in Gaul, and saw good reason for abstaining from such a\r\ndangerous adventure. The Britons, though they neglected the _tributum_,\r\nyet paid a duty on exports and imports to and from Gaul, principally\r\nivory ornaments, and the better sorts of glass and pottery; and it was\r\npointed out that the danger of a British invasion of Gallia was small,\r\nthat a military occupation of the island would cost more than the tribute\r\nwould bring in, and that the _portoria_ would be rather diminished than\r\nincreased by it.[242] Augustus, at any rate, professed to be satisfied by\r\ncertain envoys sent to him from Britain. They dedicated some offerings on\r\nthe Capitol, and received for their countrymen the title of \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of\r\nRome!\xe2\x80\x9d[243]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustus in Gaul, B.C. 27-6.]\r\n\r\nAugustus spent the summer and winter of B.C. 27-6 in Narbo, finding\r\nenough to do in holding a census of the rest of Gaul for purposes of\r\ntaxation, and regularly organising the country annexed by Iulius to\r\nthat ancient province, which had been Roman long before his time. Four\r\nprovinces were created with separate legati. The original \xe2\x80\x9cprovince\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nnow called Gallia Narbonensis; the south-western district, extending\r\nfrom the Pyrennees to the Loire, retained its old name of Aquitania;\r\nthe central or \xe2\x80\x9cCeltic\xe2\x80\x9d Gaul was called Lugdunensis, from its capital\r\nLugdunum, made a _colonia_ in B.C. 43; the northern country up to the\r\nRhine was Belgica, including the districts on the left bank of the Rhine,\r\nin which Agrippa had settled certain German tribes who had crossed the\r\nriver. Augustus was not content with a merely political organisation.\r\nHe established schools to spread the use of the Latin language, and\r\neverywhere introduced the principles of Roman law. He took especial\r\npains to adorn and promote the towns in Narbonensis, where traces of his\r\nbuildings are still to be seen. The effect of his work now and ten years\r\nlater was that Gaul became rapidly Romanised both in speech and manners,\r\nand that in learning and civilisation it soon rivalled Italy itself.\r\n\r\nThis was a work thoroughly congenial to Augustus, and in which his\r\nability was conspicuous. But he now had to engage again in war, for which\r\nhis genius was by no means so well suited. Ianus Quirinus was again open.\r\nThe surrounding barbarians were again threatening Macedonia; the Salassi\r\nof the _Val d\xe2\x80\x99Aosta_ were again making raids, and there was imminent\r\ndanger in Northern Spain. The governor of Macedonia, M. Crassus (grandson\r\nof the triumvir) had been so successful over the Thracians and Get\xc3\xa6, that\r\nhe was allowed a triumph in July, B.C. 27, but it appears that their\r\nincursions did not cease in spite of these victories.[244] The war with\r\nthe Salassi was entrusted to Terentius Varro Mur\xc3\xa6na, who, after winning\r\nsome victories in the field, sold many thousands of their men of military\r\nage into slavery, and established a colony of 3,000 veterans to overawe\r\nthem, called Augusta Pr\xc3\xa6toria, the modern Aosta.[245]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustus in Spain, B.C. 26-25.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Arabian Expedition.]\r\n\r\nFrom Narbo, Augustus next proceeded to Spain in the early part of B.C.\r\n26, and spent the rest of the year in peaceful reforms and in the\r\norganisation of the province. But in B.C. 25 he was forced to enter\r\nupon a campaign against the Cantabri and Astures, those warlike tribes\r\nin the north-west, who, nominally included in the upper province,\r\nwere continually harassing the more obedient peoples, and showing\r\ntheir dislike of Roman supremacy.[246] The war was tantalising and\r\ndifficult. The hardy highlanders knew every forest, mountain, and\r\nvalley, and the Roman soldiers could neither provide against sudden\r\nattacks, not get at the enemy in their fastnesses. From fatigue and\r\nanxiety Augustus fell ill and was obliged to retire to Tarraco, leaving\r\nthe conduct of the campaign to Gaius Antistius Vetus, who was able to\r\nwin several engagements, because after the retirement of Augustus the\r\nnatives ventured more frequently to appear in the open. Another of his\r\nlegates, Titus Carisius, took Lance (_Sallanco_); and finally Augustus\r\nfounded a colony of veterans among the Lusitani, called Augusta Emerita\r\n(_Merida_), and another called C\xc3\xa6sar-Augusta (_Zaragossa_) among the\r\nEditani, on the site of the ancient Salduba, from which all the great\r\nroads to the Pyrennees branch off. The Cantabri were not crushed, but\r\nthey were quiet for a time. Ianus was closed, and Augustus returned at\r\nthe beginning of B.C. 24; and the courtier Horace is again called on\r\nto celebrate a success, and to welcome the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s home-coming as of\r\na victor.[247] The Senate voted him a triumph, partly for the Spanish\r\ncampaign and partly for some successes of his legate, M. Vinicius, in\r\nGaul, who had caused his soldiers to proclaim Augustus imperator for the\r\neighth time. Augustus refused the triumph, but accepted the acclamation\r\nof imperator\xe2\x80\x94thus assuming as head of the army that what was everywhere\r\ndone was, to use the technical expression, done \xe2\x80\x9cunder his auspices,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand was to be reckoned to his credit. He also accepted honours for his\r\nyoung nephew Marcellus, and his stepson Tiberius. The former was admitted\r\nto the Senate with pr\xc3\xa6torian rank, and with ten years seniority for\r\noffice, in virtue of which he was at once elected \xc3\xa6dile, though only in\r\nhis twentieth year; the latter was allowed five years\xe2\x80\x99 seniority, and\r\nat once elected qu\xc3\xa6stor in his nineteenth year. A triumphal arch was\r\nalso erected in honour of Augustus in the Alpine region.[248] The temple\r\nof Ianus did not remain long closed, however. Soon after Augustus left\r\nSpain the Cantabri and Astures again rose; and in B.C. 24 took place\r\nthe ill-judged and unfortunate expedition of \xc3\x86lius Gallus into Arabia.\r\nA march of six months\xe2\x80\x99 duration, in which large numbers perished from\r\nheat and disease and only seven men in actual fighting, was followed\r\nby a retreat lasting sixty days. Gallus had been misled and duped\r\nby the satrap of the Nabat\xc3\xa6ans, and all the hopes of splendid booty\r\nwere baffled. The expedition had been approved, if not suggested, by\r\nAugustus, partly on the pretext of preventing incursions into Egypt;\r\nbut more, it would seem, because Arabia was regarded as an El Dorado,\r\nwhere vast treasures of gold and jewels were to be found, accumulated\r\nfrom the export of the rich spices of the country, which the inhabitants\r\nwere believed to keep jealously in a country as yet never pillaged by\r\nan invader. As usual, the court poets echo the popular delusions, and\r\neulogise the certain success of the Emperor; Horace harps on the rich\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctreasures of the Arabians,\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9cwell-stocked houses,\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9cvirgin\r\nstores.\xe2\x80\x9d The Roman arms are to strike terror in the East and the Red Sea,\r\nand are at length being employed on what is their proper and natural\r\nfoe.[249] Augustus, says another poet, is now a terror to the \xe2\x80\x9chomestead\r\nof the yet unplundered Arabia.\xe2\x80\x9d[250] Happily this was an almost solitary\r\ninstance of such wild schemes, prompted by greed, and promoted by\r\nignorance and delusion. Augustus came to see that the frontiers of his\r\ngreat empire afforded sufficient work for its military resources; but it\r\nwas not till near the end of his long life that a great military disaster\r\ngave him a sharp reminder of the impolicy of pushing beyond them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New buildings at Rome.]\r\n\r\nDuring these years the process of adorning Rome with splendid buildings\r\nor restorations of old ones had been steadily going on. For the largest\r\nnumber of these Augustus himself was responsible. In B.C. 28 the temple\r\nof Apollo on the Palatine, with its colonnades and libraries, had been\r\ndedicated. In the same year the restoration of 82 temples was begun on\r\nhis initiative, and apparently at his expense. The new temple of Mars\r\nUltor, vowed at Philippi, with its surrounding forum Augustum, was in\r\nprocess of erection, as well as another to Iupiter Tonans on the Capitol,\r\nvowed in the course of the Cantabrian expedition to commemorate a narrow\r\nescape from being struck by lightning. He also completed the forum and\r\nbasilica partly erected by Iulius, had begun or projected the _porticus\r\nLivi\xc3\xa6 et Octavi\xc3\xa6_, and had erected the imposing rotunda intended as the\r\nmortuary of the Iulian _gens_: while Statilius Taurus had built the first\r\namphitheatre, Plancus a great temple of Saturn, and Cornelius Balbus\r\nwas about to begin a new theatre. But most splendid of all were the\r\nbenefactions of Agrippa. Baths, bridges, colonnades, gardens, aqueducts,\r\nwere all dedicated by him to the use of the public. Above all, by B.C.\r\n25 he had completed the magnificent Pantheon, still in its decline one\r\nof the most striking buildings in the world. It was dedicated to Mars\r\nand Venus, mythical ancestors of the Iulian _gens_, but its name may\r\nbe derived either from its numerous statues of the gods, or from the\r\nsupposed likeness of its dome to the sky. Its purpose\xe2\x80\x94beyond being a\r\ncompliment to Augustus\xe2\x80\x94is still a subject of dispute. Nor have we any\r\nrecord of its use except as the meeting-place of the Arval brothers.[251]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The illness and recovery of Augustus, B.C. 23.]\r\n\r\nGreat way, therefore, was already made towards justifying the boast of\r\nAugustus that he found Rome brick and left it marble. For these buildings\r\nwere lined or paved with every kind of precious marble and stone. But\r\nthe year following his return from Spain witnessed a crisis in his\r\nlife as well as in his political position. He seems to have been in a\r\nfeeble state of health all through B.C. 24, the effect probably of his\r\nfatigues and anxieties in Spain. But soon after entering on his eleventh\r\nconsulship in B.C. 23, he became so much worse that he believed himself\r\nto be dying. It became necessary, therefore, to make provision for the\r\ncontinuance of the government. Augustus had no hereditary office, and no\r\npower of transmitting his authority. Still it was supposed that he was\r\ntraining his nephew and son-in-law Marcellus, or his stepson Tiberius,\r\nto be his successor. The former was curule-\xc3\xa6dile, and seems to have\r\nconceived the ambition of succeeding his uncle. But when he thought death\r\napproaching, Augustus did not designate either of these young men. He\r\nhanded his seal to Agrippa, and the official records of the army and\r\nrevenue to Cn. Calpurnius Piso, his colleague in the consulship. He would\r\nplay his part as constitutional magistrate to the last. To speculate\r\non what might have been is not very profitable. Agrippa had advised a\r\nrestoration of the republic in B.C. 30. But every year since then had\r\nmade it more difficult; and, if he had wished to do it, he would probably\r\nhave found it as impossible as his master had done, and would have had\r\nto choose between supporting Marcellus and taking the direction of\r\naffairs into his own hands. The difficulty, however, did not arise; for\r\nowing either to the goodness of his constitution, or the skill of his\r\nphysician, Antonius Musa, Augustus recovered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new constitutional settlement, B.C. 23.]\r\n\r\nWhen he met the Senate once more he offered to read his will to prove\r\nthat he had been true to his constitutional obligations, and had named\r\nno successor, but had left the decision in the hands of the Senate and\r\npeople. The Senators, however, declined to hear it, but insisted that the\r\npowers which he had been exercising should be more clearly defined and\r\nplaced on a better legal footing. Accordingly a _Senatus-consultum_ was\r\ndrawn up, to be afterwards submitted to the centuriate assembly, giving\r\nhim a variety of powers, and forming a precedent which was followed in\r\nthe case of subsequent emperors. It began with a confirmation of the\r\n_tribunicia potestas_, for life and unlimited as to place, with the right\r\nof bringing business of any kind before the Senate (_ius relationis_).\r\nIt next gave him the _ius proconsulare_, both within and without the\r\npom\xc3\xa6rium, involving a _maius imperium_ in all provinces. Further, it gave\r\nhim the right of making treaties; the right of summoning, consulting,\r\nand dismissing the Senate (_ius consulare_); the confirmation of all his\r\n_acta_, \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever he shall think to be for the benefit and honour of the\r\nrepublic in things divine and human, whether public or private\xe2\x80\x9d; finally,\r\nexemption from the provisions of certain laws and _plebiscita_. Some\r\nlegal difficulty was apparently discovered afterwards as to the right of\r\nproposing laws to the centuriate assembly, which was remedied in B.C.\r\n19 by his receiving the full consular power for life, with the right\r\nof having _lictors_, and sitting on the consular bench. This seems to\r\nhave been a concession to legal purists. He doubtless exercised the full\r\nconsular powers before; but a distinction was drawn by some between the\r\n_ius consulare_ and the _imperium consulare_, and whatever doubt there\r\nmight be was now set at rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The imperial powers.]\r\n\r\nAs the imperial powers may now be considered as fully developed, future\r\nextensions being merely logical deductions from the constitution as now\r\nestablished, it will be convenient here once for all to point out their\r\nnature and extent. They may be classed under two headings\xe2\x80\x94(1) _imperium_;\r\n(2) _potestas tribunicia_.\r\n\r\nThe first\xe2\x80\x94_imperium_\xe2\x80\x94embraces all those powers which Augustus obtained as\r\nrepresenting the curule magistrates, or from special law and senatorial\r\ndecrees. As imperator, then, he had supreme command of all forces by\r\nland or sea. The military oath was now taken in his name, no longer to\r\nindividual officers raising legions. He alone had the right to enrol\r\nsoldiers; he nominated the officers; his procurators paid the men in his\r\nname; from him proceeded all rewards. The Senate, indeed, still awarded\r\ntriumphs and _triumphalia ornamenta_, but it was at his suggestion, and\r\nthe tendency was to confine the right of triumph to the Emperor himself.\r\n\r\nBy the same _imperium_ he decided on questions of peace or war; on the\r\ndistribution of the _ager publicus_, and the assignation of lands to\r\nveterans and _coloni_ generally.\r\n\r\nFinally, the right of conferring the citizenship, complete or partial,\r\nand settling the status of all colonies and _municipia_, and of\r\ninterpreting the laws by a _constitutio principis_, expressed in an edict\r\nor decree, which amounted, in fact, to legislative power.\r\n\r\nThe second\xe2\x80\x94_potestas tribunicia_\xe2\x80\x94was superior to the ordinary powers\r\nof the tribunes, because by it he could veto their proceedings, while\r\nthey could not veto his. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gave him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to use Dio\xe2\x80\x99s words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe means of\r\nabsolutely putting a stop to any proceeding of which he disapproved;\r\nit rendered his person inviolable, so that the least violence offered\r\nhim by word or deed made a man liable to death without trial as being\r\nunder a curse.\xe2\x80\x9d From the ancient constitution of the office also it\r\nmade him president of the _comitia tributa_ (representing the old\r\n_consilia plebis_), gave him the right of interposing in all decisions of\r\nmagistrates or Senate affecting the persons or civil status of citizens\r\n(_auxilii latio_), and that of compelling obedience by imprisonment or\r\nother means, as in the republic the tribunes had done even to the consuls\r\nin extreme cases (_coercitio_). Though this power was given the Emperor\r\nfor life, it was also in a sense annual; and it was in effect so much\r\nthe most important of all his powers, while at the same time in origin\r\nand professed object so much the most popular, that it became the custom\r\nfrom henceforth to date all documents, inscriptions, and the like, by the\r\nyear of the tribunician power from 27th of June this year (B.C. 23). The\r\n_imperium_ was renewed at intervals of ten or five years, the tribunician\r\npower of Augustus went on from year to year without break. It was now\r\nunnecessary any longer to hold the consulship, for the _imperium_ given\r\nhim in other ways covered all, and more than all, which the consulship\r\ncould give. It was convenient to use it for rewarding others, as it\r\nretained all its outward signs of dignity, and still in theory made\r\nits holder head of the state, though in reality its duties had become\r\nalmost wholly ceremonial. He therefore abdicated the consulship, which he\r\ndid not hold again till B.C. 5, when he desired to give _\xc3\xa9clat_ to his\r\ngrandson\xe2\x80\x99s _deductio in forum_.\r\n\r\nThe clause in the _lex_, quoted above, also gave Augustus supreme control\r\nof all religious matters, and made him able, among other things, to\r\nnominate most of the members of the sacred colleges. He did not become\r\nPontifex Maximus till the death of Lepidus (B.C. 13). When that took\r\nplace he became official, as well as real, head of the Roman religion.\r\n\r\nCertain other arrangements in regard to the city of Rome itself followed,\r\nall in the direction of centralisation. Thus Augustus presided at the\r\nreview of the equites, which used to be held by the censors. Public\r\nworks were mostly entrusted to _curatores_ appointed by him; for the\r\nsupply of corn he named a _pr\xc3\xa6fectus annon\xc3\xa6_; and for police a _pr\xc3\xa6fectus\r\nurbi_, under whom were the _cohortes urban\xc3\xa6_, the night-watch and fire\r\nbrigade (_nocturni vigiles_). Each of these bodies had their own\r\nofficers or _pr\xc3\xa6fecti_; but Augustus from time to time appointed some\r\none as _pr\xc3\xa6fectus urbi_, to whom all alike would be subject. Such an\r\nofficer, however, did not always assume the name, and really as well as\r\ntheoretically the ultimate authority was Augustus himself, who later on,\r\nby dividing Rome into _regiones_ and _vici_, made elaborate arrangements\r\nfor the effective policing of the city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The succession.]\r\n\r\nAugustus might pose as a constitutional magistrate enjoying a life-tenure\r\nof his office, without the right of transmitting it to an heir. This view\r\nwas strictly legal, but it was evident that such a power could not safely\r\nbe left by its holder without any understanding as to a successor. The\r\nmatter was indeed in the hands of Senate and people; but in the minds of\r\npossible heirs, as well as of the Senate and people themselves, it began\r\nto be thought natural and necessary that some arrangement of the sort\r\nshould be made. The cases are numerous in all history of rulers, whether\r\nnew or hereditary, who have wished to found or continue a dynasty, or\r\nwho have thought to prevent confusion and danger after their own death\r\nby naming a successor, or by taking him into present partnership. Such a\r\nscheme was not as yet fully developed, even if it was contemplated. But\r\nMarcellus, who had been adopted by Augustus on his marriage to Iulia,\r\nbetrayed his hopes by protesting against the preference shewn by the\r\napparently dying Emperor to Agrippa; and Augustus yielded so far as to\r\nsend Agrippa from Rome as governor of Syria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Marcellus.]\r\n\r\nA sudden disaster, however, put an end to any intention that may have\r\nbeen formed in regard to Marcellus. In the summer of B.C. 23, he was\r\nattacked by fever, and Antonius Musa, who had successfully treated\r\nAugustus by a _r\xc3\xa9gime_ of cold baths, tried a similar treatment on the\r\nyoung man with fatal effect. His death was a great grief to Augustus\r\nand so severe a blow to Octavia, that she lived afterwards in complete\r\nretirement. It produced a sensation in Rome such as has been witnessed\r\nmore than once among us at the death of an heir to the throne; and has\r\nbeen immortalised by a celebrated passage inserted by Vergil in the sixth\r\nbook of the _\xc3\x86neid_, a work in which Augustus was specially interested\r\nas a consecration of the greatness of Rome and the hereditary dignity of\r\nthe Iulian _gens_. It is skilfully placed at the end of the catalogue of\r\nRoman heroes whose souls are being reviewed by Anchises in the Elysian\r\nrealms, where they are waiting their time for entering the bodies of men\r\ndestined to make Roman history. The Marcellus of the Punic war naturally\r\nintroduces the younger shade, whose brief tenure of life is even now\r\nforeshadowed by the cloud that hangs about his brow. When Vergil recited\r\nthe lines to the Emperor and his sorrowing sister, Octavia fainted from\r\nemotion, and Augustus bestowed a splendid reward upon the poet. It may\r\nhelp us to realise the scene if we once more read the familiar lines.\r\n\xc3\x86neas notices the mysterious and melancholy shade and eagerly questions\r\nhis father:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What youth is this of glorious mien\r\n    The noblest and the best between,\r\n    Cheered to the echo? See, a cloud\r\n    (The darkening shadow of the shroud)\r\n    Hovers about him even now,\r\n    And black night broods upon his brow.\r\n    Is he some scion of the race,\r\n    Destined our mighty line to grace?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    Thus spake the son, the father sighed,\r\n    And thus with rising tears replied:\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Seek not, my son, to learn the woe,\r\n    Your progeny is doomed to know.\r\n    The fates will show and then withdraw\r\n    The gift men loved but hardly saw.\r\n    Too mighty, gods! for so you deemed,\r\n    With such a prince Rome\xe2\x80\x99s race had seemed!\r\n    What sobs shall thrill the Martian plain!\r\n    Ah, Tiber, what dark funeral train\r\n    Your waves shall see, as past the Mound\r\n    New-built you sweep your waters round!\r\n    No scion of the Ilian stock\r\n    Shall raise such hopes, such hopes shall mock.\r\n    Ah, Romulus, thy land shall see\r\n    No son to fire thy pride as he.\r\n    Oh loyalty! Oh faith unstained!\r\n    Oh strong right hand to yield untrained!\r\n    Whether on foot he grasped the sword,\r\n    Or charger\xe2\x80\x99s flank with rowel scored,\r\n    No foe would e\xe2\x80\x99er have faced his steel\r\n    Nor learnt what \xe2\x80\x99tis the vanquished feel.\r\n    Oh child of many tears, if fate\r\n    Shall not prevent your living date,\r\n    Thou art Marcellus! Lilies fair\r\n    Scatter in handfuls on his bier!\r\n    Oh let me but his herse bestrew\r\n    With flowers bright with purple hue.\r\n    Vain gift! but let it still be paid\r\n    To grace my far-off grandson\xe2\x80\x99s shade.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe death of Marcellus had occurred in an unhealthy season when many\r\nshared the same fate. Yet there were found people who attributed it to\r\nLivia\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy on behalf of her son Tiberius, and her anger at the\r\npreference shown to the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s nephew. Scarcely any death occurred\r\nin the imperial family that did not give rise to some such idle and\r\nmalevolent gossip. But the Emperor soon had cause to regret the absence\r\nof Agrippa, who was living in Lesbos and administering Syria by his\r\nlegate. The next year was a year of sickness and scarcity at Rome, and\r\nwas also disturbed by more than one outbreak of political unrest, one\r\nof the few conspiracies against the life of Augustus being detected and\r\npunished. We do not know why Mur\xc3\xa6na and Fannius C\xc3\xa6pio plotted to kill\r\nAugustus, if they really did so. It may be that the change made in the\r\nprincipate in B.C. 23 seemed to them to be too much in the direction\r\nof autocracy, or that the consulship without Augustus as colleague\r\nsuggested some idea that its old supremacy might be recovered. The\r\nviolent party strife which occurred later at the election for B.C. 21,\r\nmay have had some connection with the same feeling. Mur\xc3\xa6na had had a\r\nsuccessful career, had been rewarded by an augurship and a consulship\r\nin B.C. 23, and there is nothing known which explains his conduct. It\r\nmay be that his offence was chiefly intemperance of language. Dio says\r\nthat he had a sharp tongue which spared no one, and Horace perhaps\r\nmeant to give him a hint in the ode addressed to him. Velleius tells\r\nus that, unlike his fellow conspirator Fannius C\xc3\xa6pio, he was a man of\r\nhigh character.[252] At any rate their execution\xe2\x80\x94for both are said\r\nto have been put to death\xe2\x80\x94is one of the few instances of severity on\r\nthe part of Augustus since the civil war. This trouble was followed\r\nby others\xe2\x80\x94a renewed outbreak in Spain, riots at the elections, and a\r\ncoldness between himself and his devoted friend and minister M\xc3\xa6cenas,\r\ncaused, it is said, by his being supposed to have communicated to his\r\nwife Terentia, the sister of Mur\xc3\xa6na, some secret as to the detection of\r\nthe plot. All these things must have caused Augustus much uneasiness. He\r\nhad left Rome in the summer of B.C. 22 for Sicily, intending to start\r\nthence on another progress through the Eastern Provinces. There urgent\r\nmessages came to him to return and put a stop to the disturbances. He\r\ndid not wish to give up his Eastern journey and yet did not venture to\r\nleave the city without some control. His thoughts turned naturally to\r\nthe support that had never failed him\xe2\x80\x94to Agrippa. He was summoned home\r\nprimarily to take charge of Rome; but he came back to what seemed the\r\nhighest possible position next to that of the Emperor, and one that\r\npromised a still greater one in the future. Augustus insisted on his\r\ndivorcing Marcella (daughter of Octavia) and marrying his own daughter\r\nIulia, left a widow by Marcellus. As usual Agrippa did all that was\r\nimposed upon him well and thoroughly (B.C. 21-20). Having restored order\r\nin the city, he next went to Gallia Narbonensis, where he not only put\r\na stop to some dangerous disturbances, but initiated great public works\r\nin the way of roads and aqueducts. Passing to Spain he finally crushed\r\nthe Cantabri and Astures, who were again in arms. He seems indeed to\r\nhave suffered reverses in this war, as his master had done before, but\r\nin the end he reduced them to submission. All this good work was done\r\nwhile Augustus was in the East (B.C. 21-19), and for it he refused the\r\ntriumph offered him by the Senate at the instigation of the Emperor.\r\nBut his succession, should he survive the Emperor, was now secured by\r\nhis being associated with him in the _tribunicia potestas_ and other\r\nprerogatives for five years at the first renewal of his powers in B.C.\r\n17. Agrippa had now two sons by Iulia, Gaius born in B.C. 20, Lucius in\r\nB.C. 17; and Augustus adopted both of them by the ancient process of a\r\nfictitious purchase. He had now legitimate heirs and nothing farther was\r\ndone about the succession for some years. Agrippa died in March, B.C.\r\n12, just as his period of tribunician power was expiring. But during\r\nthese years the two sons of Livia, Tiberius and Drusus, had begun those\r\nservices on the German frontier and among the Rh\xc3\xa6ti and other powerful\r\ntribes which proved their vigour and ability. These services were\r\nrenewed, after a few months\xe2\x80\x99 interval of quiet, in B.C. 13 and following\r\nyears. Accordingly Augustus seems to have meditated putting Tiberius in\r\nmuch the same position as Agrippa had held. In B.C. 11 he compelled him\r\nto divorce his wife Vipsania (a daughter of Agrippa) and marry Agrippa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow Iulia, the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s only daughter. He thought still farther to\r\nsecure a line of descendants to succeed if necessary to his power. But he\r\nmade the mistake of neglecting sentiment. Tiberius was devotedly attached\r\nto Vipsania, by whom he had a son, and could feel neither affection nor\r\nrespect for Iulia, who fancied that she lowered herself in marrying him.\r\nThe only thing that could compensate him for such a marriage was the\r\nchance of succession, and that was barred by the existence of Gaius and\r\nLucius C\xc3\xa6sar. His only son by Iulia died, and before long her frivolity\r\nand debaucheries disgusted him, and therefore, though associated in\r\nthe tribunician power for five years in B.C. 7, he sought and obtained\r\npermission in the next year to retire to Rhodes, where he stayed seven\r\nyears in seclusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gaius and Lucius C\xc3\xa6sar.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boys were being brought up with a view to their splendid\r\nfuture under the eye of Augustus, when he was at home, and often under\r\nhis personal instruction, accompanied him as they grew older on his\r\njourneys, in a carriage preceding his own or riding by his side, and in\r\nfact were treated in every way as real and much beloved sons. In the year\r\nin which they assumed the _toga virilis_ (B.C. 5 and B.C. 2) Augustus\r\nagain entered upon the consulship, that the _deductio in forum_ should be\r\nas brilliant and dignified as possible. The Senate was not behindhand;\r\nfrom the day of taking the _toga virilis_ it voted that they should be\r\ncapable of taking part in public business, and each of them in turn was\r\ndesignated consul, Gaius to enter upon his office that time five years.\r\nA new dignity moreover was invented, each in turn being named by the\r\nequites _princeps inventutis_. As Augustus was _princeps senatus_ as well\r\nas _princeps civitatis_, each of these young men was to be the head of\r\nthe next _ordo_, the original condition for belonging to which was that\r\na man must be _iuvenis_. Both were members of the College of Augurs.\r\nThey were, in fact, treated as we expect to see princes of the blood and\r\nheirs-apparent treated.[253] But whatever was the intention of Augustus\r\nor the expectation of the people, fate interposed ruthlessly. The\r\nyounger\xe2\x80\x94Lucius\xe2\x80\x94died first, on the 20th of August, A.D. 2, at Marseilles,\r\nbefore he could enter on the consulship to which he had been designated;\r\nthe elder Gaius was sent into Asia in B.C. 1, where he entered upon his\r\nconsulship of A.D. 1. The object of his mission was to force Phraates\r\nIV., king of the Parthians, to evacuate Armenia which he had invaded.\r\nThis was accomplished without fighting and by personal negotiation with\r\nthe Parthian king; but when he entered Armenia to take possession and\r\narrange for its restoration to its recognised king, he was wounded by\r\nan act of treason under the walls of Artagera. Weakened by this wound,\r\nand being in other respects in a feeble state of health and spirits, he\r\nobtained leave from Augustus to lay down his command. He started on his\r\nhomeward journey, but died on the way at Limyra in Lycia the 23rd of\r\nFebruary, A.D. 4.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius finally fixed upon as successor.]\r\n\r\nThe succession was once more uncertain. The members of the imperial\r\nfamily at this time were few. Of the children of Agrippa and Iulia\r\nAgrippa Postumus was barely sixteen, and his two sisters, the younger\r\nIulia and Agrippina a few years older. Drusus, the younger brother of\r\nTiberius, had married Antonia, daughter of Marcus Antonius and Octavia,\r\nand had left three children, Germanicus, b. B.C. 15, Livia b. B.C. 12,\r\nand Claudius (afterwards Emperor) b. B.C. 10. Augustus meant to provide\r\na new line of descendants by marrying Agrippina to Germanicus, but that\r\ndid not take place till about A.D. 5. Meanwhile, probably on Livia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuggestion, he turned his thoughts to his stepson Tiberius, who had\r\ndivorced Iulia and had a son (Drusus) by his former wife Vipsania, who\r\nwas married to his cousin Livia. There is no good evidence that Augustus\r\nentertained any but warm feelings for Tiberius, and he certainly had\r\nhad good reason to respect his military abilities and energy. He seems\r\nto have been hurt at his prolonged stay at Rhodes and to have regarded\r\nit as a sign that Tiberius cared nothing for him and his family. He\r\nhad therefore discouraged his return two years before, though he had\r\ngiven him the position of legatus as a colourable pretext for staying\r\nabroad without loss of dignity. Upon the death of Lucius, however, he\r\nseems to have wished him to return to Rome. Tiberius did so, partly\r\non the instigation of his mother, and partly, perhaps, because he had\r\nreason to expect the hostility of Gaius, and yet had judged from the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s visit to him on his way to Syria that he was not likely to be a\r\nformidable rival; for he was at once somewhat arrogant and weak, and was\r\nsurrounded by injudicious and dishonest advisers. On his return he for\r\nsome time lived in retirement and refrained from all public business.\r\nBut when the death of Gaius was announced (A.D. 4) Augustus adopted\r\nTiberius and Agrippa Postumus, having first arranged that Tiberius\r\nshould adopt his nephew Germanicus. The adoption of Agrippa Postumus\r\nwas shortly afterwards annulled, and he was banished to an island under\r\nsurveillance.[254]\r\n\r\nThere was now therefore a regular line of succession. Tiberius indeed had\r\nno drop of Iulian blood in his veins, but adoption according to Roman\r\nlaw and sentiment placed him exactly in the same position as that of a\r\nnaturally born son, and by his son\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Antonia, his adoption of\r\nGermanicus, and the marriage of the latter to Agrippina, it seemed that\r\nthere was security that after him must come some one who was collaterally\r\nor directly descended from Augustus. In the same year (A.D. 4) Tiberius\r\nwas once more associated with Augustus in the tribunician power for ten\r\nyears.[255] There could be no longer any doubt who would succeed. At the\r\ndeath of Augustus there would be, if Tiberius survived, a man already\r\npossessed of the most important of his functions; and his position\r\nwas still farther strengthened in the last year of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nby being associated also in his _imperium proconsulare_. This gave him\r\nauthority in the provinces and the command of all military forces; and\r\nwe find him, in fact, upon the death of Augustus giving the watchword at\r\nonce to the pr\xc3\xa6torian guard.\r\n\r\nAugustus therefore is responsible for the principate of Tiberius, though\r\nsome of its powers had to be formally bestowed by a decree of the\r\nSenate. Did he do ill or well in this? Hardly any emperor left behind\r\nhim such an evil reputation as Tiberius. His funeral procession was\r\ngreeted with shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cTiberius to the Tiber,\xe2\x80\x9d the Senate did not vote\r\nhim the usual divine honours, and Tacitus has exerted all his skill to\r\nmake his name infamous. A gallant attempt has been made by Mr. Tarver to\r\nplead for a rehearing of the case, and to shew that Tiberius was pure\r\nin private life and admirable as a ruler. I for one agree with him in\r\nrejecting as unproved slander and often as physically impossible the\r\ncharges of monstrous immoralities raked up both by Tacitus and Suetonius,\r\noften, no doubt, from the prurient gossip of Rome, which has never been\r\nsurpassed for foulness. The same summary rejection cannot, I think, be\r\napplied to the formidable list of his cruelties. But these mainly fell\r\nupon members of the imperial family and their adherents; they did not\r\naffect the Empire at large. Augustus could not foresee these family and\r\ndynastic tragedies; but he judged, and apparently judged rightly, that\r\nhe was leaving a successor whose prudence and sagacity, in spite of\r\nwhat seemed a sullen reserve, would secure the peace and prosperity of\r\nthe Empire as a whole. There is nothing to prove that Augustus regarded\r\nhim otherwise than affectionately. If he turned out to be the monster\r\nrepresented by his enemies, Augustus no doubt made a grave mistake. It is\r\na ridiculous suggestion that he deliberately designated him his successor\r\nin order that people might regret himself. Such recondite snares for\r\nposthumous fame are more like the cunning of a madman than the motives\r\ninfluencing a reasonable being. Suetonius, who reports the suggestion,\r\nsays that after mature reflection he is convinced that a man so careful\r\nand prudent as Augustus must have acted on better motives; must have\r\nweighed the virtues and faults of Tiberius and decided that the former\r\npredominated. As a matter of fact Augustus had little choice. Agrippa\r\nPostumus was impossible; Germanicus might have served, but he could never\r\nhave displaced his uncle without a struggle. At the time of Tiberius\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadoption he was only nineteen, and Augustus could not reckon on the ten\r\nmore years of life which in fact remained for him. No doubt in these last\r\nyears of his life Augustus had come to see that some sort of hereditary\r\nprinciple was necessary to prevent civil war at every vacancy. In B.C. 23\r\nhe had ignored that principle altogether, and as far as he could without\r\nnaming an heir had put Agrippa in the way of the succession. But Agrippa\r\nhad now been dead nearly sixteen years, and Augustus had had no minister\r\nsince either so able or so faithful. Like Cromwell in his last hours, he\r\nwas driven to recognise the conveniency of the hereditary principle; and\r\nthough the practical designation of Tiberius was apparently a breach of\r\nit, yet by means of the adoptions and marriages which he had arranged,\r\nit best prepared for its continuance hereafter. It was one of those\r\npolitic compromises which had characterised his whole policy. It moreover\r\nbest secured the position and safety of the beloved Livia; and it set\r\na precedent which was often followed with advantage in after-times,\r\nwhen military arrogance and violence did not overpower every other\r\nconsideration, that an Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s natural heir should be his successor,\r\nor at any rate some one closely allied to him; and that in case of the\r\nfailure or complete unworthiness of such an heir a prudent emperor should\r\nprovide for the succession by adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL AND MILITARY POLICY OF AUGUSTUS\r\n\r\n    _Tu regere imperio populos,_\r\n    _Romane, memento._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The extension of the Empire under Augustus.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of his life Augustus left, among other memoirs, a roll\r\ncontaining certain maxims of state which he thought important for his\r\nsuccessors to observe. Among them was an injunction not to seek to\r\nincrease the Empire, for it would be difficult to guard an extended\r\nfrontier. His own policy had been directed generally on this principle.\r\nSuch additions as were made in his time were mainly those rendered\r\ninevitable by the necessity of securing the already existing frontiers.\r\nWhen his generals went beyond that they met with difficulties and\r\nsometimes with disaster.[256] The additions actually made were (1) in\r\nAfrica: Egypt was made a province in B.C. 30, at first almost as a\r\nprivate possession of the Emperor, though in B.C. 10 it was, nominally\r\nat any rate, put on the same footing as the other provinces. Mauretania,\r\non the other hand, though made a province in B.C. 33, was restored to\r\nindependence under King Iuba in B.C. 25. (2) In Asia a new province of\r\nGalatia was formed in B.C. 25, with a capital at Ancyra, and embracing\r\nseveral districts, such as Lycaonia, Isauria, Pamphylia, and parts of\r\nPhrygia. (3) In the West, sometime before A.D. 6, M\xc5\x93sia, answering to\r\nthe modern Servia and Bulgaria, was made a province as a barrier of\r\nthe Empire on the Danube. So also Illyricum, in B.C. 9-8, was extended\r\nto the Danube by the addition of Pannonia; Noricum, also on the Danube,\r\nwas held in subjection, if not fully organised as a province, after B.C.\r\n16; and Rh\xc3\xa6tia (modern Bavaria) was put under a Roman procurator after\r\nB.C. 15. All these additions were clearly rendered necessary in order to\r\nprotect the line of the Danube as the frontier of the Empire. Lastly, on\r\nthe reorganisation of Gaul in four provinces (B.C. 16-14), two districts\r\nalong the left bank of the Lower Rhine, called Germania Superior and\r\nGermania Inferior, were also occupied and partly organised, while some\r\nminor Alpine districts, Alpes Maritim\xc3\xa6 (Savoy and Nice), Alpes Cotti\xc3\xa6\r\n(Susa and district), Alpes Pennin\xc3\xa6 (Canton du Valois) were taken over\r\nand administered sometimes independently and sometimes as part of other\r\nprovinces. In these cases again the extension was merely consequential,\r\nthe inevitable result of having a long frontier to defend against\r\ninvading tribes.[257] The Rhine and the Danube then became the limits\r\nof the Empire. We shall have occasion to see immediately what dangers\r\nawaited an attempt to go beyond them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The East.]\r\n\r\nAugustus twice spent periods of between two and three years in the East,\r\nengaged in resettling frontiers and re-organising the Roman provinces.\r\n\r\nAfter the victory at Actium (B.C. 31) he remained in the East till B.C.\r\n29. The changes then made chiefly consisted in upsetting most of the\r\narrangements which had been made by Antony with various client kings,\r\nand in favour of the children of Cleopatra. Thus Cyprus, which had been\r\nrestored to Cleopatra, was now separated from Egypt and made a province;\r\nthe coast towns of Syria and Palestine were reunited to the province of\r\nSyria; certain cities of Crete and Cyrene, Iud\xc3\xa6a and Itur\xc3\xa6a, and of\r\nCilicia, which Antony had assigned to Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s son, C\xc3\xa6sarion, were\r\neither reunited to the provinces or declared free, as was also the case\r\nwith other districts and towns assigned by Antony to his own son by\r\nCleopatra. Certain client kings, however, were allowed to retain their\r\nterritory and dignity, such as Herod in Iud\xc3\xa6a, Amyntas in Galatia,\r\nArchelaus in Cappadocia. But the eternal question in the East was that\r\nof the Parthians. They not only were resolved to maintain the Euphrates\r\nas the limit beyond which Roman power was not to pass, but they had\r\nfrequently made raids upon Syria, and were always attempting to occupy\r\nArmenia, which was a Roman protectorate, and the intervening kingdom\r\nof Media. The disaster of Crassus in Mesopotamia, and the chequered\r\noperations of Antony, had all sprung from these facts. When Augustus\r\narrived in Asia the state of things which had finally resulted from\r\nthe operations of Antony was that Artaxes (whose father, Artavasdes,\r\nhad been treacherously captured by Antony and afterwards put to death\r\nby Cleopatra) was king of Armenia, and had attacked Media and captured\r\nits king Artavasdes; and that Phraates had recovered his kingdom of\r\nParthia. Augustus had two or three advantages in dealing with these\r\ncomplications. He found the brothers of the Armenian Artaxes still\r\nprisoners at Alexandria, and sent them to Rome as hostages. Again the\r\ncaptured king of Media managed to escape and appealed to him for help;\r\nand, lastly, Phraates of Parthia had only just recovered his throne,\r\nfrom which he had been expelled by a rebellion headed by Tiridates, and\r\nthe latter escaped to Syria and sent to implore the help of Augustus,\r\nwhile legates from Phraates also arrived soliciting his support. Augustus\r\navailed himself skilfully of these complications to assume the position\r\nof a lord paramount and arbiter. He allowed Tiridates to remain in\r\nsafety in Syria; but he treated the legates of Phraates in a friendly\r\nmanner, and cordially invited a son of that king to accompany him to\r\nRome, where, however, he was kept as a hostage. Artavasdes was set up in\r\nLesser Armenia to form a check upon Artaxes. These diplomatic successes\r\nwere regarded in Rome, as we have seen, as veritable triumphs over the\r\ndangerous Parthians\xe2\x80\x94the only name much known there. The abolition of the\r\narrangements of Antony, which had involved the curtailment of the Roman\r\nEmpire, was recorded on coins struck in B.C. 29, with a head of Augustus\r\non the obverse, and on the reverse a figure of victory standing on the\r\nmystic cista, with the legend _Asia recepta_. But it is with his second\r\nEastern progress (B.C. 22-19) that the useful public works, such as roads\r\nand buildings, of which traces are still found, probably began.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Movements in the East between B.C. 24 and B.C. 22.]\r\n\r\nBetween these two visits there had been only two movements of serious\r\nimportance\xe2\x80\x94the useless and almost disastrous expedition of \xc3\x86lius\r\nGallus into Arabia (B.C. 24-3), and the invasion of Southern Egypt at\r\nElephantine by Candace, queen of \xc3\x86thiopia, encouraged by the diminution\r\nof the Roman forces in Egypt during the Arabian expedition. The\r\n\xc3\x86thiopians gained some minor successes over three Roman cohorts stationed\r\nnear the frontier, but were eventually repulsed by the pr\xc3\xa6fect Gaius\r\nPetronius, who pursued them to their capital town Nabata, which he took\r\nand plundered.[258]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Eastern progress, B.C. 22-19.]\r\n\r\nThe second eastward progress of Augustus began with some months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nresidence in Sicily. There he was busied in founding colonies, of which\r\nseven are named. The chief town of Sicily was still Syracuse, but it\r\nseems to have suffered in the time of Sextus Pompeius, and Augustus\r\nplaced in it two thousand settlers, probably veterans. It was the object\r\nof such colonies to provide for veterans and poor Italians, but also\r\nto Romanise countries more completely, and to introduce an industrial\r\nclass. Sicily needed above all things free cultivators. Its corn trade\r\nhad suffered from the competition of Africa, Sardinia, and Egypt, and\r\nits pastoral farms were largely owned by Roman capitalists, who did not\r\nreside, but employed slave-labour directed by bailiffs or _villici_.[259]\r\nOne object at least, therefore, of these measures of Augustus was to\r\nbring into the country a class of small landowners residing on their\r\nproperty. Land was found for them by purchase, where there was no _ager\r\npublicus_ available.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustus in Greece B.C. 21.]\r\n\r\nFrom Sicily Augustus passed to Greece and wintered at Samos. Achaia\r\nwas a senatorial province, but the Emperor, we may notice, exercised\r\ncomplete authority there. He had already established two colonies\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nActium and Patr\xc3\xa6, and he seems to have devoted most of his attention\r\nto promoting their interests. He compelled the inhabitants of several\r\ntownships in the neighbourhood of both towns to migrate to the new\r\ncolonies, and he insisted on the colony at Actium being admitted to the\r\nAmphictyonic League. The places were well chosen for naval purposes, but\r\nthe element of compulsion in his policy towards them was unfortunate.\r\nHe does not appear to have done much for Greece generally. It was in\r\na lamentably decaying state, the population declining, and old towns\r\ndisappearing. Nearly the only exception was the Iulian colony at Corinth.\r\nSuch changes as Augustus made on this visit rather tended to emphasise\r\nthis state of things, and certainly did nothing to relieve it. Athens,\r\nwhich retained nothing of its greatness except its past and the still\r\nsurviving reputation as a university town (though Marseilles was running\r\nit hard even in that), had disgraced itself in his eyes by the display of\r\nsympathy, first for the Pompeians against Iulius, again for Brutus and\r\nCassius against the triumvirs, and lastly for Antony against himself. A\r\ntown always on the losing side can expect little favour. It was deprived\r\nof its few remaining extra-Attic dependencies, \xc3\x86gina and Eretria, and\r\nwas forbidden to avail itself of almost the only source of revenue\r\nleft\xe2\x80\x94the fees which certain persons were still willing to pay for the\r\nhonour of being enrolled as its citizens. Sparta, indeed, was rewarded\r\nby the restoration of Cythera, in return, it is said, for hospitality\r\nto Livia when in exile with her former husband; but, on the other hand,\r\nit was deprived of the control over its harbour town of Gythium. But\r\nthough both Iulius and Augustus favoured Sparta, as against Athens\xe2\x80\x94a fact\r\ncommemorated by a temple to Iulius and an altar to Augustus\xe2\x80\x94it remained\r\ncompletely insignificant.\r\n\r\nVery different was his policy in Asia. There Augustus set himself to\r\nrestore the prosperity of the towns by grants of money, by relief from\r\nor readjustment of tribute, and by the promotion of useful public works.\r\nNor were details of local administration and internal reforms neglected.\r\nEdicts are preserved which touch on such matters as the age of local\r\nmagistrates, or the succession to the property of intestates in Bithynia,\r\nshewing with what minute care he studied local interests and problems.\r\nIt was now probably that schemes were set on foot for opening up the\r\ncountry by roads, afterwards carried out by his legates. Milestones are\r\nbeing now discovered along the _via Sebaste_ connecting the six Pisidian\r\ncolonies dated in the eighteenth year of his tribunician power (B.C. 6)\r\nand a marble temple to Augustus still stands at Ancyra (_Angora_), to\r\nwitness the gratitude of these Asiatic cities. At the same time disorder\r\nor illegal conduct was sternly punished. Cyzicus was deprived of its\r\n_libertas_ for having flogged and put to death some Roman citizens, and\r\nthe same punishment was awarded for their internal disorders to Tyre and\r\nSidon, whose ancient liberties had been secured to them by Antony when he\r\nhanded over the country to Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of the standards by the Parthians.]\r\n\r\nBut of all his achievements during this progress nothing made such a\r\nsensation in the Roman world, or was so much celebrated by the poets of\r\nthe day, as the fact that he received back from the Parthian king the\r\nRoman eagles and standards lost by Crassus in B.C. 53, by Antony\xe2\x80\x99s legate\r\nDecidius Saxa in B.C. 40, and by Antony himself in B.C. 36 in a battle\r\nwith Parthians and Medes. Those taken by the Medes had been returned to\r\nhim, but not those taken by the Parthians. In B.C. 23 Tiridates, who\r\nhad been allowed to take refuge in Syria in B.C. 30, came to Rome, and\r\nPhraates, to counteract his appeal, sent ambassadors thither also. After\r\nconsulting the Senate Augustus declined to give up Tiridates, but he\r\nsent back to Phraates the son whom he had kept at Rome for the last six\r\nyears on condition that the king should restore the standards. Pressed\r\nthough he was by the disaffection of his subjects, Phraates had not\r\nyet fulfilled his bargain. But perhaps this disaffection had by B.C.\r\n20 become more acute, or he was alarmed by the promptness with which\r\nAugustus asserted Roman supremacy in Armenia. Artaxes had ruled ill and\r\nhad been insubordinate. Augustus appears to have meditated an expedition\r\nagainst him, but his subjects anticipated the difficulty by assassinating\r\nhim. Augustus says that he might have made Armenia a province, but\r\npreferred to allow the ancient kingdom to remain. Accordingly on his\r\norder Tiberius went to Armenia and with his own hand placed the diadem\r\non the head of Tigranes, brother of the late king, who had been living\r\nin exile at Rome. Thus the supremacy of Augustus was acknowledged in\r\nArmenia and its king ruled by his permission. A coin struck in B.C.\r\n19 represents it as a real capture of Armenia, having on its reverse\r\n_C\xc3\xa6sar Div. F. Armen. capt. Imp. viiii._ The Parthian king thought it\r\nwell now to fulfil his bargain, and again Tiberius was commissioned to\r\nreceive the captured standards in Syria. With the standards were also\r\nsome prisoners; though there were others who had in the thirty-three\r\nyears that had elapsed since the fall of Crassus settled peaceably in\r\nParthian territory, married wives, and now refused to return.[260] Such\r\na contented abandonment of their native land seemed shocking to the\r\northodox Roman, unable to suppose life worth living among barbarians\r\nfor one who had once been a citizen of the Eternal City. Prisoners of\r\nwar were never much valued at Rome. It was the traditional maxim that\r\nthe state never paid ransom, though private friends might and did, and\r\nHorace\xe2\x80\x99s ode may be meant to support the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s refusal of some\r\ndemand of Phraates for ransom of prisoners to accompany the standards.\r\nThis transaction, however, was the crown of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s work in the\r\nEast. It is commemorated on coins of B.C. 19 bearing a triumphal arch,\r\nwith Augustus receiving the standards, on the obverse, and the legend\r\n_civibus et signis militaribus a Parthis receptis_ on the reverse. The\r\npoets were not behind with their compliments. Vergil, who was in Greece\r\nin this the last year of his life, seems to have inserted three lines in\r\nhis description of opening the doors of Bellona to bring in an allusion\r\nto it.[261] Horace, who had for the time given up lyric poetry, yet\r\ncontrives a compliment in one of his epistles;[262] and, on returning\r\nto lyric poetry in B.C. 13-12, is careful to include it among the great\r\nservices of Augustus; and Propertius, after prophetic suggestions as to\r\nwhat will be done, at last burst out into a triumphant hymn of praise\r\nover the achievements of these years, and, above all, on the Nemesis that\r\nhas come for the slaughtered Crassus.[263] Many years afterwards Ovid\r\ntakes the opportunity in describing the temple of Mars Ultor, in which\r\nAugustus deposited the recovered standards, to glorify him for having\r\nwiped out an old and shameful stain upon the Roman arms.[264] There\r\nwere many other arrangements made with the client kings of Asia, all of\r\nwhich were accompanied by the strict condition that they were henceforth\r\nto confine themselves to the territories now assigned to them and were\r\nto make no wars of aggression. The _pax augusta_ was to be strictly\r\nmaintained everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustus returns from the East, B.C. 19.]\r\n\r\nAll this had been done without any drop of blood shed in war, and\r\nAugustus was able to devote the winter of B.C. 20-19 at Samos to rest and\r\nenjoyment, receiving numerous embassies from all parts, as far as from\r\nIndia. The Indian envoys brought him a present of tigers, a beast never\r\nbefore seen in Greece or Italy, and a wonderful armless dwarf who could\r\ndraw a bow and throw javelins with his feet. He returned next year by way\r\nof Athens, where he was initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries and where\r\nhe met with Vergil. The poet joined the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s train, visited Megara\r\nwith him, and returned with him to Italy, only to fall ill at Brundisium\r\nand die (September 22).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troubles in the West. Defeat of Lollius, B.C. 16.]\r\n\r\nThough Augustus returned to Rome amidst loud congratulations, the Western\r\npart of the Empire was not yet at peace, and in fact there were many\r\nthreatening signs of future trouble. Agrippa, indeed, in the very year\r\nof the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s return from the East, crushed the rebellious Cantabri\r\nand Astures, not without severe fighting; but though Augustus was able\r\nnow to remain at home, passing laws, holding the secular games, and\r\nstrengthening his family by adopting Agrippa\xe2\x80\x99s children, the Empire was\r\nnot at peace, the Ianus Quirinus still stood open. There were, in fact,\r\na number of \xe2\x80\x9clittle wars,\xe2\x80\x9d mostly frontier raids. Thus in B.C. 17-16, P.\r\nSilius Nerva was engaged with various Alpine tribes, and in repelling an\r\ninroad of Pannonians. There were also about the same time brief outbursts\r\nin Spain and Dalmatia, and inroads of barbarous tribes (Denthelet\xc3\xa6 and\r\nScordisci) into Macedonia. In Thrace the guardian of the sons of Cotys\r\nhad to be assisted against the Bessi, and the Sauromat\xc3\xa6 had to be driven\r\nback across the Danube. These were comparatively unimportant affairs, But\r\na more serious danger was caused by some warlike German tribes\xe2\x80\x94Sugambri,\r\nUsipetes, and Tencteri\xe2\x80\x94crossing the Rhine and invading Gallia Belgica.\r\nThey defeated some Roman cavalry, and while pursuing them came up with\r\nLollius and his main army, which they again defeated, capturing the\r\neagle of the Fifth Legion. Suetonius says that the affair was rather\r\ndisgraceful than really disastrous. But it seemed sufficiently serious\r\nto Augustus. Agrippa was away in the East looking after Syria and Asia,\r\nand did not return till B.C. 13; and he resolved to go to Gaul himself,\r\ntaking with him Tiberius, and leaving Drusus to carry on the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npr\xc3\xa6torship. The Germans, however, had no wish to fight a regular imperial\r\narmy, they therefore retired beyond the Rhine, and made terms and gave\r\nhostages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Administration of Gaul, B.C. 16-14.]\r\n\r\nAugustus nevertheless found enough to do without positive fighting in\r\nintroducing improvements and reforms. At Nemausus the old gate of the\r\ntown walls still stands, inscribed with his name, and dated in the\r\nseventh year of his tribunician power (B.C. 16); he had, moreover, to\r\nlisten to long tales of grievances caused by the extortions of Licinius,\r\nthe procurator at Lugdunum. This man\xe2\x80\x99s career was an early example of\r\nthat of the rich freedmen of later times. Brought as prisoner from Gaul\r\nby Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar, and apparently emancipated by Octavian in accordance\r\nwith his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s will, he had by some means amassed an immense fortune,\r\nand retained the favour of Augustus by large contributions to the\r\npublic works from time to time promoted by the Emperor. A millionaire\r\ndisposed to such liberality is always welcome to a sovereign with a\r\ntaste for expensive reforms. As a Gaul by birth, Augustus seems to have\r\nsupposed that he would be a sympathetic officer. But he proved more\r\nRoman than the Romans in exacting the last farthing. We are reminded\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cMorton\xe2\x80\x99s fork\xe2\x80\x9d and of Empson and Dudley, when we are told that he\r\ninsisted on certain monthly payments being made fourteen times in the\r\nyear, on the ground that November and December meaning the ninth and\r\ntenth months, there must be two more to be accounted for! The complaints\r\nwere so serious, however, that Licinius thought it necessary to offer to\r\nsurrender his whole property to Augustus, as though he had only amassed\r\nit for the public service, with the deliberate purpose of weakening the\r\ndisloyal natives. We are not told whether he was left in power, but\r\nat any rate he escaped punishment and survived Augustus. He probably\r\nwas recalled to Rome, where he tried to pacify public indignation by\r\nlarge contributions to the restoration of the Curia Iulia, which was\r\nre-dedicated in honour of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s grandsons about A.D. 12.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Campaigns of Tiberius and Drusus, B.C. 15.]\r\n\r\nBut another and more serious trouble had now to be faced. The Rh\xc3\xa6ti,\r\ninhabiting the modern Grisons, Tyrol, and parts of Lombardy, were making\r\nraids upon Gaul and Italy, burning and slaying and plundering. With them\r\nwere allied the Vindelici (inhabiting parts of modern Baden, Wurtenburg,\r\nand S. Bavaria), with other Alpine tribes.[265] The campaign against\r\nthese tribes was intrusted to Tiberius, who conceived a masterly plan\r\nwhich was crowned with brilliant success. Drusus was summoned from Rome\r\nto guard the passes into Lombardy, and in the valleys of the Tridentine\r\nAlps at the entrance of the Brenner pass, near the Lacus Benacus (Lago\r\ndi Garda), he won a brilliant victory over them, and forced many of\r\ntheir mountain strongholds. Shut off thus from Italy they turned their\r\narmies towards Helvetic Gaul, but were met by Tiberius and again\r\ndefeated between B\xc3\xa2le and the Lake of Constance. These two defeats seem\r\npractically to have annihilated these tribes, and they gave no further\r\ntrouble. It was after this that Noricum was annexed, and Rh\xc3\xa6tia and\r\nVindelicia conquered, and presently formed into the province Rh\xc3\xa6tia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At the end of B.C. 14 Augustus returns to Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 13.]\r\n\r\nStill Augustus had to stay on another year in Gaul. Risings had to be\r\nsuppressed among the Ligurians of the Maritime Alps, and in Pannonia;\r\nwhile Agrippa, who had returned from Palestine accompanied or followed by\r\nHerod, went to Sinope, on the Pontus, to put down a disturbance that had\r\narisen owing to a disputed claim to the crown of the Cimmerian Bosporus,\r\nwhich an usurper named Scribonius had seized. At the end of B.C. 14, or\r\nthe beginning of B.C. 13, Augustus returned to Rome with Tiberius, who\r\nentered then upon his first consulship, and there they were also joined\r\nby Agrippa. Whether the temple of Ianus was now closed for the third time\r\nis not certain. But there are some good reasons for supposing that it\r\nwas. In two passages, Horace, writing in B.C. 13, speaks of it as though\r\nit were a recent occurrence; Dio, in speaking of the return of Augustus,\r\nsays that he came back after \xe2\x80\x9chaving settled all the affairs of the\r\nGauls, Germanies and Spains\xe2\x80\x9d; there was certainly a lull in the German\r\ntrouble, where Drusus had been left in command; and lastly an inscription\r\nrecording the extension of the great road to Gades in Southern Spain,\r\nhas the date of this year, and records the closing of Ianus in honour\r\nof Augustus. None of these are in themselves absolute proofs, but taken\r\ntogether they form a strong presumption.[266] At any rate, Augustus\r\nreturned to Rome with the feeling that he had secured peace. Though he,\r\nas usual, avoided meeting a complimentary procession by entering the city\r\nafter nightfall, yet he came with laurelled fasces. The next morning,\r\nafter greeting a crowd of people on the Capitol, he caused the laurels to\r\nbe taken off and solemnly laid on the knees of Jupiter, and the first\r\nbusiness he transacted in the Senate was the settlement of the claims of\r\nhis soldiers. But the peace did not last long. Augustus himself spent the\r\nnext three years in Italy busied with the census, the lectio senatus,\r\nlegislation, and various ceremonies. Lepidus died in the early part of\r\nthis year, and he was at once declared Pontifex Maximus, though the\r\n_inauguratio_ did not take place till the following February.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Agrippa, B.C. 12.]\r\n\r\nHowever, before the year was ended, news came of disturbances in\r\nPannonia, and Agrippa\xe2\x80\x94once more associated in the tribunician power\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nsent thither. He had no fighting, for the rising was abandoned at his\r\napproach. It was his last journey. Next spring he was taken ill in one\r\nof his Campanian villas. Augustus threw all business aside and hastened\r\nto his house, but arrived too late. Never had ruler a more faithful or\r\nabler friend and servant. At every crisis of his life Agrippa had been by\r\nhis side, and wherever danger was most threatening he had taken the post\r\nof difficulty and honour. If he gained wealth in his master\xe2\x80\x99s service,\r\nhe was always ready to spend it in support of his master\xe2\x80\x99s aims. In the\r\ninterests of the dynasty he had sunk all private wishes and ambitions.\r\nAbout Agrippa the passion for prurient scandal, characteristic of the\r\nage and people, for once is silent, and not a single line or innuendo\r\nsurvives to impeach his private or public life. Augustus shewed both his\r\nrespect and deep feeling. He accompanied the body to Rome, pronounced the\r\nfuneral oration himself, and deposited the ashes in the new mausoleum\r\nwhich he had erected for his own family.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius in Pannonia.]\r\n\r\nThe news of Agrippa\xe2\x80\x99s death seems to have encouraged the Pannonians\r\nonce more to strike for freedom. Tiberius accordingly was appointed to\r\nsucceed him in the command. He laid waste wide portions of their country,\r\ninflicted much slaughter upon the inhabitants, and seems quickly to have\r\nreduced them to obedience, though only for a time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drusus in Germania B.C. 12-9.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Drusus was not idle. The Sugambri and their allies crossed the\r\nRhine into the district called Lower Germany, a part of Belgium (now\r\nNorth Brabant), where they would find tribes nearly allied to themselves,\r\nand willing to shake off the Roman yoke. Drusus had been engaged in the\r\nconsecration of an altar to Augustus at Lugdunum, where he had invited\r\nthe attendance of leading Gauls from all these provinces. He hurried back\r\nto the Rhine and drove the invaders over the river, and then throwing a\r\nbridge across it (somewhere below Cologne), he attacked the Usipites on\r\nthe right bank of the Lupia, and then marched up the Rhine to attack the\r\nSugambri. But there was a fleet of ships supporting him in the Rhine. He\r\ncut a canal from the River to Lake Flevo (Zuyder Zee), so that this fleet\r\nmight sail up the coast to the mouths of the three rivers\xe2\x80\x94the Amisia,\r\nVisurgis, and Albis (_Ems_, _Weser_, _Elbe_). He proposed to make the\r\nElbe the limit of the Roman Empire, instead of the Rhine; but in this\r\nfirst year only reduced the coast as far as the Visurgis. The next year\r\n(B.C. 11), he advanced by land to the same river, only farther inland,\r\nand occupied the country of the Cherusci (Westphalia), and though on\r\ntheir way home his men were nearly caught in an ambush, they got back\r\nsafely to the banks of the Lupia, and several forts were established in\r\nvarious parts of the country. The next year (B.C. 10) he was engaged\r\nwith the Chatti (Hessen), who endeavoured to regain the territories from\r\nwhich he had driven them in the previous year.[267] In B.C. 9, being\r\nnow consul, he pushed as far as the Elbe, where he erected a trophy to\r\nmark the extreme limit of the Roman advance, through the land of the\r\nChatti and Trevi. But on his return march he fell and broke his leg, and\r\nthere being no skilled physician with the army, he died after thirty\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 suffering. Besides these marches into Germany, he had, during his\r\ncommand, established a line of fortresses on the Lower Rhine, to the\r\nnumber of fifty, as far up the stream as Argentoratum (Strassburg).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius in Germany B.C. 8-7.]\r\n\r\nOn hearing of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s accident, Tiberius, who was at Ticinum,\r\nhurried to his side, was with him when he died, and accompanied the\r\ncorpse on foot back to Rome, where he delivered a funeral oration, and\r\nAugustus, who returned from Lugdunum at this time, another. The ashes\r\nwere placed in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Tiberius was appointed to\r\nsucceed him on the Rhine, and in B.C. 8 crossed the river to attack the\r\nSugambri. But as the other tribes made their submission, the Sugambri\r\nwere induced to send some of their leading men to negotiate also.\r\nAugustus then took a step which requires, at any rate, some explanation.\r\nHe seized these legates and kept them in confinement in various towns as\r\nhostages. It had the immediate effect, however, of keeping the Sugambri\r\nquiet, large numbers of them were settled on the left bank of the Rhine,\r\nand Tiberius was able to come home for his triumph in B.C. 7, with which\r\nthe name of Drusus was also associated.\r\n\r\nNo wars of any consequence disturbed the peace of the Empire for nearly\r\nnine years. Tiberius retired to Rhodes in B.C. 6, and his successors in\r\nthe command of the army of the Rhine had the task of maintaining and\r\nstrengthening the conquests of Drusus. The two districts on the left bank\r\nof the river, Germania Inferior and Superior, though for some purposes\r\nthey belonged to Gallia Belgica, yet as military districts were distinct,\r\nand they included some fortresses on the right bank of the Rhine. The\r\ncountry between the Rhine and the Elbe was in an ambiguous position. It\r\nwas not a province, and yet the commanders on the Rhine occupied as much\r\nof it as they could from time to time maintain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius again in Germany and Illyricum, A.D. 4-7.]\r\n\r\nBut in A.D. 4 Tiberius, now returned from Rhodes, and adopted son of\r\nAugustus, took over the command on the Rhine, and immediately began a\r\ngreat forward movement like that of his brother Drusus. He too advanced\r\nto the Weser and reduced the Cherusci who were in revolt; and after\r\nmarching to the Lippe again, advanced to the Elbe (A.D. 5), reducing\r\nthe Chauci and Longobardi, this time with the support of a fleet that\r\nentered the mouth of the Elbe. Some others thought it safer to send\r\nenvoys and make terms of friendship with Rome. Next year (A.D. 6) he was\r\nto attack the Marcomanni under a powerful leader named Marobudus. The\r\nattack was to be made from two sides. C. Sextius Saturninus, an able\r\nand experienced officer, was to lead one army from the Rhine, through\r\nthe territory of the Chatti (near Cologne), while Tiberius himself led\r\nanother from Noricum across the Danube. The two were to converge upon\r\nthe district now occupied by the Marcomanni answering to the modern\r\nBohemia. Tiberius was accompanied by the governor of Pannonia (Valerius\r\nMessalinus), and a large part of the troops stationed there. But the\r\nexpedition was prevented by a sudden rising in Pannonia and Dalmatia. The\r\ninhabitants of these countries had not become reconciled to Roman rule;\r\nthey felt the burden of the tribute, and the opportunity afforded by the\r\nwithdrawal of so many troops was eagerly seized. Tiberius was forced to\r\noffer terms to Marobudus, which he accepted, and hurry back to Pannonia,\r\nwhile Saturninus returned to the Rhine for fear of an outbreak there.\r\nThe rising in Pannonia and Dalmatia was with difficulty suppressed after\r\na weary struggle lasting between three and four years. Many legions had\r\nto be drafted into the country from other provinces as well as large\r\nauxiliary forces. Germanicus was summoned to assist with a new army, and\r\nAugustus himself came to Ariminum to be near at hand. Suetonius affirms\r\nthat it was the most serious struggle in which the Romans had been\r\nengaged since the Punic wars. In B.C. 9 Tiberius indeed returned to Rome\r\nto claim his triumph, but had to go back to put a last touch to the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fall of Varus, A.D. 9.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the army of the Rhine had been under the command of P.\r\nQuintilius Varus. Velleius gives an unfavourable account of him. He\r\nwas more a courtier than a soldier, and in his government of Syria had\r\nshown himself greedy of money. \xe2\x80\x9cHe entered a rich province a poor man,\r\nand left a poor province a rich one.\xe2\x80\x9d From the time of his accession to\r\nthe command in B.C. 7 he seems to have regarded the country between the\r\nRhine and Elbe as completely reduced to the form of a Roman province,\r\nand proceeded to levy tribute with the same strictness as he had been\r\nused to do in Syria. But the German tribes did not regard themselves as\r\nRoman subjects. The Romans were only masters of so much as their camps\r\ncould control. While Varus was living in fancied security in his summer\r\ncamp on the Weser, busied only with the usual legal administration of a\r\nprovincial governor, four great German peoples, the Cherusci, Chatti,\r\nMarsi, and Bructeri, were secretly combining under the lead of the\r\nCheruscan chief, Arminius, to strike a blow for liberty. As the autumn of\r\nA.D. 9 approached Varus prepared to return to the regular winter quarters\r\non the Rhine (Castra Vetera). Arminius, who had served in the Roman\r\narmy, and had been rewarded by the citizenship and the rank of eques,\r\nhad ingratiated himself with Varus, and was fully acquainted with his\r\nplans, and though Varus had been warned of his treachery he seems to have\r\ntaken no heed. In order to bring him through the difficult country where\r\nthe ambush was to await him, a rising of a tribe off his direct road to\r\nthe Lower Rhine was planned. He fell into the trap, and turning aside to\r\nchastise the rebellious tribe, was caught in a difficult pass, somewhere\r\nbetween the sources of the Lippe and Ems, and he and nearly the whole\r\nof his army perished. For three days the army struggled through a thick\r\nand almost pathless forest, encumbered by a heavy baggage train, and a\r\nnumber of women and children, attacked and slaughtered at nearly every\r\nstep by the Germans who were concealed in the woods, and continually made\r\ndescents upon them. A miserable remnant was saved by the exertions of L.\r\nAsprenas, a legate of Varus, who had come to the rescue. Varus and some\r\nof his chief officers appear to have committed suicide. The loss of three\r\nlegions and a large body of auxiliaries greatly affected the Emperor,\r\nnow a man of over seventy. For many months he wore signs of mourning,\r\nand we are told that at times in his restless anxiety he beat his head\r\nupon the door, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cVarus, give me back my legions!\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps this is\r\nthe picturesque imagination of anecdote mongers. Though alarmed for the\r\npossible consequences both at home and in the provinces, he acted with\r\nspirit and energy. He ordered the urban pickets to be carefully posted,\r\nsuspended all changes in provincial governments, and held a levy of\r\ncitizen soldiers, enforcing by threats and punishment the duty of giving\r\nin the names. For some time past service in the army had been regarded as\r\na profession sufficiently attractive to draw volunteers, without having\r\nrecourse to the legal right of conscription. But a sudden emergency\r\nlike this seems to have found men apathetic or disinclined, and he had\r\nto resort to the old methods. He thought it necessary also to get rid\r\nfor a time of Gauls or Germans who were serving in the city cohorts or\r\nresiding in Rome. Tiberius, on the news of the disaster, hurried from\r\nhis Pannonian quarters to Rome, and was appointed to the Rhine command,\r\nto which he went early in A.D. 10. The danger most to be feared was\r\nthat the victorious Germans would at once cross the Rhine. But this had\r\nbeen averted partly because the Marcomanni had declined to join the\r\ninsurrection, even when Arminius sent the head of Varus to their chief,\r\nMarobudus, and partly by the fact that the rebellious Germans themselves\r\nwasted time in blockading Aliso, the fort erected by Drusus on the Lippe,\r\nwhich was obstinately defended by its garrison under Lucius C\xc3\xa6dicius. It\r\nproved to be the Ladysmith of the German war, for the Germans, fearing to\r\nleave it on their rear, missed the opportunity of attacking the camps on\r\nthe Rhine before they could be reinforced. The brave garrison, when their\r\nprovisions were exhausted, escaped on a dark night and reached Castra\r\nVetera in safety. Still, the result of the rising was to free Germany\r\nbeyond the Rhine. When Tiberius arrived to take the command in A.D. 10,\r\nhe spent the first year in strengthening the forts along that river; and\r\nthough in A.D. 11 he moved his summer camp beyond it, he never went far,\r\nor apparently engaged in any warlike operations then or in A.D. 12. In\r\nthe next year he returned to Rome and was succeeded in the command by his\r\nnephew, Germanicus. The forward movements of this young prince belong to\r\nthe next reign, but Tiberius no doubt learnt now what a few years later\r\ninduced him to recall Germanicus and be content with the frontier of the\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Administrative reforms. The post.]\r\n\r\nThe life of Augustus was now near its close, and there are no more\r\nmilitary enterprises to record. He had never commanded in the field\r\nsince the Cantabrian war of B.C. 25; but he had taken part in the most\r\nimportant wars by moving to within such a distance of the seat of war as\r\nto hear news quickly and to superintend the despatch of provisions and\r\nreinforcements. He was probably more usefully employed in this way, and\r\nwas enabled to see, by personal observation, the needs of the provinces\r\nand the best methods of remedying abuses and promoting prosperity. In\r\nthe course of his reign he is said to have visited every province except\r\nSardinia and Africa, and hardly any is without some trace of his activity\r\nand liberality in the way of roads, bridges, or public buildings. He\r\nwas anxious that all, however distant, should feel in touch with the\r\ncentral authority at Rome. Among other means to promote this was the\r\nestablishment or improvement of an imperial post which should reach the\r\nmost distant dependencies.\r\n\r\nWe must not think of this as being like the modern postal service\xe2\x80\x94meant\r\nfor the general use of the public. It was purely official. Just as the\r\nmain purpose of the great roads was to facilitate the rapid movement\r\nof armies and officials, so the post was a contrivance to expedite\r\nofficial despatches, to convey the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s orders to remotest parts\r\nof the Empire, and to carry back news and warnings to the government\r\nat home. Along the great roads in Italy and the provinces there had\r\nlong been posting houses where relays of horses, mules, or carriages\r\ncould be obtained, but there was never what we should call a postal\r\nservice for the transmission of private letters. Rich men kept slaves\r\nfor this purpose (_tabellarii_), the magistrates had official messengers\r\n(_statores_), and the companies of _publicani_ had their regular service\r\nof carriers. Private people could, as a favour, get their letters\r\noccasionally conveyed by some of these; and it was considered a proper\r\nact of politeness at Rome when despatching a slave with letters to\r\ndistant places, to send round to one\xe2\x80\x99s friends to know whether they\r\nwished to send any by him. Again, governors of provinces under the\r\nrepublic had arranged with certain scribes in Rome to copy out the\r\n_diurna acta_ and transmit them by slaves or paid messengers. But for\r\nofficial purposes Augustus arranged a number of stations along the great\r\nroads with men, horses, and carriages, to convey to and from Rome all the\r\nnews that it was needful for the government to know or all orders that\r\nemanated from the Emperor.[268] Private persons would have no right to\r\nuse these public servants or conveyances; but no doubt the organisation\r\nfor the public service facilitated the transmission of private\r\ncorrespondence also.\r\n\r\nThis actual and material tightening of the bond which united distant\r\nparts of the Empire with the central government went side by side with\r\nthe moral effect of the change in the position of the governors. No\r\nlonger permitted to make what profit they could from excessive exactions,\r\nor percentages allowed by usage though not by law, they all received a\r\nfixed salary, as did the lesser officials; and though extortion was still\r\noccasionally heard of, the provinces knew that they had a rapid means of\r\nappealing to the Emperor and a fair certainty of redress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The army under one commander-in-chief.]\r\n\r\nAnother change that made at first for unity, though it afterwards had\r\nthe contrary effect, concerned the army. In the time of the republic\r\nthere was in theory no one standing army. There were many armies, all\r\nof which took the military oath to their respective commanders. Now the\r\nmilitary oath was taken by all to one man\xe2\x80\x94the Emperor. The commanders of\r\nlegions were his _legati_. He regulated the pay, the years of service,\r\nthe retiring allowance for all alike. Each of the republican imperators\r\nhad a pr\xc3\xa6torian guard, generally consisting of auxiliary troops. Now\r\nthere was one pr\xc3\xa6torian guard, naturally stationed at Rome, and though\r\ndistinguished from the rest by increased pay and easier years of service,\r\nit, as well as the _cohortes vigilum_, was under the same command. This\r\napplies also to the fleet which was organised under Augustus chiefly\r\nto protect the coast and clear the sea of pirates: the two principal\r\nstations being at Misenum on the west, and Ravenna on the east coast,\r\nwith a third maintained for a time at Forum Iulii (Fr\xc3\xa9jus). The men\r\nserving in these ships occupied the same position as citizen soldiers\r\nor auxiliaries, and like them took the oath to one man\xe2\x80\x94the Emperor.\r\nBut the very completeness of the organisation, it is right to notice\r\nhere, eventually made for disruption. Certain legions became constantly\r\nattached to certain provinces, the auxiliaries serving with them being\r\nas a rule recruited from the same provinces. The several branches of the\r\narmy thus came to feel an _esprit de corps_, and to regard themselves\r\nas a separate entity with separate interests and claims. Consequently,\r\nwhen in after-times the central authority was in dispute or in process\r\nof change, the legions in the different provinces spoke and thought\r\nof themselves as separate \xe2\x80\x9carmies,\xe2\x80\x9d capable of taking an independent\r\nline and having a determining voice in deciding who should be their\r\nImperator. In those troublous times the provinces which had no military\r\nestablishment, or only a weak one, ceased to count for much, and had\r\nto follow the strongest army near them.[269] For the present such\r\ndifficulties were not foreseen. Augustus was a strict disciplinarian,\r\nand little was heard as yet of any serious insubordination. When it\r\ndid occur it was promptly punished. He disbanded the 10th legion for\r\nmisconduct, and exercised at times the full vigour of military punishment\r\nfor desertion of posts or lesser offences, and was careful in addressing\r\nhis troops not to lower his dignity by affectation of equality. He called\r\nthem \xe2\x80\x9cSoldiers!\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cFellow-soldiers!\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time he kept up the\r\ntraditional exclusiveness of the legions, and seldom employed freedmen,\r\nexcept as a kind of special constable in the city, and twice in times\r\nof great distress, the Illyrian and German wars: even then they were\r\nformed in separate cohorts, and armed in some way less complete than the\r\nlegionaries.\r\n\r\nThe same conservative attachment to the ancient superiority of Rome\r\nmade him chary of granting the citizenship either to individuals, or to\r\nmasses of soldiers, or to states. This was one of the points in which\r\nhis policy was opposite to that of Iulius. The latter by his large\r\ngrants of citizenship to soldiers, professional men and communities,\r\nhad helped to raise the number of citizens from about 450,000 in B.C.\r\n70 to 4,063,000 (the number in the Census of B.C. 28). During the\r\nforty-five years that remained to Augustus the number had only gone up\r\nto 4,937,000 (the Census of A.D. 13). This is probably little more than\r\ncan be accounted for by the growth of population; so that extensions of\r\nthe franchise must have been insignificant. His idea was an empire, one\r\nin its military obligations and in its subjection to one supreme head,\r\nand yet not divorced from the original city state. Rome was to be the\r\nimperial city, the seat of government; the Populus Romanus was to be the\r\ninhabitants of Rome extended to the limits of Italy. There was to be a\r\nsharp line of division between the ruling and the ruled. It was one of\r\nthose compromises that are without the elements of permanence. And yet\r\nit established a sentiment that has lasted, and is a reason that even to\r\nthis day the centre of spiritual life to a large part of Europe is on the\r\nbanks of the Tiber. In material matters the extension of the citizenship\r\nmeant the gradual shifting of the centre of power, and when early in\r\nthe third century Caracalla, for purposes of taxation, extended the\r\ncitizenship to the whole Empire, though the Roman name and its historical\r\nprestige remained, Rome itself became only one of a number of cities in\r\na widely spread empire, and politically by no means the most important.\r\nSuch a conception was far from the mind of Augustus. It would have seemed\r\nto him to be more worthy of his rival Antony, who was for setting up a\r\nnew Rome in Alexandria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS AND HIS WORSHIPPERS\r\n\r\n    _O tutela pr\xc3\xa6sens_\r\n    _Itali\xc3\xa6 domin\xc3\xa6que Rom\xc3\xa6._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular feeling towards Augustus.]\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement of the constitution in B.C. 23 Augustus was only\r\nabsent from Italy three times, from B.C. 22 to B.C. 19 in Sicily and the\r\nEast, from B.C. 16 to B.C. 13 in Gaul and Spain, and B.C. 9-10 in Gaul.\r\nAt the outbreak of the Pannonian and Dalmatian wars A.D. 6-9 he stayed\r\nfor some time at Ariminum. For the rest of the time he lived at Rome,\r\nwith the usual visits to his country houses, made by land or yacht.\r\nHis return to the city after any prolonged absence was celebrated with\r\nevery sign of rejoicing, with sacrifices, music, and a general holiday.\r\nOn his return from Gaul in B.C. 13 an altar was dedicated to _Fortuna\r\nredux_.[270] Nor was this mere adulation. The people had come to look\r\nupon him as the best guarantee of peace and security. The troubles of\r\nthe days preceding the civil wars, the street fighting and massacres,\r\nthe horrors of the civil war itself, were not forgotten: but his own\r\npart in them was ignored or forgiven; it was only remembered that he had\r\nput an end to them; that he had restored the ruinous city in unexampled\r\nsplendour; that it was owing to his liberality, or that of his friends\r\nacting under his influence, that at Rome there were luxurious baths,\r\nplentiful water, abundant food, streets free from robbers, help ready in\r\ncase of fire, and cheerful festivals nearly always in progress. It was\r\nthanks to him that the roads in Italy were not beset by brigands, that\r\nthe corn-ships from Egypt crowded the harbour of Puteoli unmolested by\r\npirates on their course,[271] that not only the dreaded Parthian, but\r\nprinces from the ends of the earth were sending embassies desiring the\r\nfriendship of Rome. At the least sign of the old disorders they clamoured\r\nfor his return and besought him to become Dictator, director of the corn\r\ntrade, perpetual guardian of morals, anything, convinced that under his\r\nabsolute rule there would be peace, plenty, and security. Horace exactly\r\nrepresents this feeling when he addresses Augustus in his absence in\r\nGaul: \xe2\x80\x9cOh scion of the gracious gods, oh best guardian of the race of\r\nRomulus ... return! Your country calls for you with vows and prayer ...\r\nfor when you are here the ox plods up and down the fields in safety;\r\nCeres and bounteous blessing cheer our farms; our sailors speed o\xe2\x80\x99er seas\r\nthat know no fear of pirates; credit is unimpaired; no foul adulteries\r\nstain the home; punishment follows hard on crime.... Who fears Parthian,\r\nScythian, German, or Spaniard with C\xc3\xa6sar safe? Each man closes a day of\r\npeace on his native hills, trains his vines to the widowed trees, and\r\nhome returning, light of heart, quaffs his wine and ends the feast with\r\nblessings on thee as a god indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d[272]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The worship of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nThese feelings found expression in a form which in our day is apt\r\nto appear, according to our temperament, ridiculous or profane. In\r\nplain terms this was to treat Augustus as divine, a god on earth. The\r\nvarious expressions of Horace[273] may perhaps be put down to poetical\r\nexaggeration or conventional compliment, though there is a real meaning\r\nat their back; but though Augustus refused to allow temples and altars\r\nto himself in Rome and Italy,[274] and even ordered certain silver\r\nstatuettes to be melted down, the evidence of inscriptions makes it\r\ncertain that the cult began in his lifetime in several places, as at\r\nPompeii, Puteoli, Cum\xc3\xa6 in Campania, and in other parts of Italy.[275]\r\nIn Rome itself, when Augustus reorganised the _vici_, the old worship\r\nof the _Lares Compitales_ at some consecrated spot in each _vicus_\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cparish\xe2\x80\x9d was restored, but they were commonly spoken of as _Lares\r\nAugusti_, and the _Genius Augusti_ was associated with them. It is this\r\nfact that, to a certain extent, explains and renders less irrational an\r\nattitude of mind which we are apt to dismiss as merely absurd. Each man\r\nhad a _Genius_\xe2\x80\x94a deity to whom he was a particular care. We speak of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmission,\xe2\x80\x9d implying by the word itself some external and directing\r\npower, probably divine. The step is not a long one which identifies the\r\nman and his genius, especially when his mission seems to be to bring\r\nus peace and prosperity. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Melib\xc3\xa6us, \xe2\x80\x99twas a god that wrought this\r\nease for us!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaims the countryman in Vergil, who had got back his\r\nlands. This confusion between the inspirer and the inspired, between the\r\nmission and the man, was everywhere apparent. Among the statues in the\r\ntemples, and in the sacred hymns and other acts of worship, the figure\r\nor the name of Augustus was associated with those of the gods in a way\r\nthat admitted, indeed, of a distinction being drawn between a memorial\r\nto an almost divine man and an act of devotion to a god, but often\r\nobscured that distinction for ordinary folk. When we dedicate a church\r\nto a saint, or \xe2\x80\x9cto the glory of God and in memory of So-and-so,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ndistinction is of course clear, but the confusion which has from time to\r\ntime resulted is also notorious. Thus in the Cuman Calendar of a sacred\r\nyear, in which the anniversaries of striking events in the career of\r\nAugustus are marked for some act of worship, sometimes the _supplicatio_\r\nis bluntly stated as _Augusto_; sometimes in honour of some abstract idea\r\nas _imperio Augusti_, _Fortun\xc3\xa6 reduci_, _Victori\xc3\xa6 August\xc3\xa6_; at others to\r\na god\xe2\x80\x94_Iovi sempiterno_, _Vest\xc3\xa6_, _Marti Ultori_, _Veneri_. In fact, the\r\n_supplicatio_ always had a double reference, it was an act of prayer or\r\nthanksgiving to a god, but it was also an honour to a successful man. The\r\ntwo ideas properly distinct easily coalesced. A _supplicatio_ in honour\r\nof Augustus, without much violence, became a _supplicatio_ to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALTAR DEDICATED TO THE LARES OF AUGUSTUS IN B.C. 2 BY A\r\nMAGISTER VICI.\r\n\r\n_Photographed from the Original in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence._\r\n\r\n_To face page 196._]\r\n\r\nOf the still more formal cult which arose after his death with a temple\r\nregularly dedicated to him by Livia on the Palatine, and a new college\r\nof Augustales to keep up the worship in all parts of the Empire, an\r\nexplanation somewhat analogous may be given. He was declared _divus_ by\r\nthe Senate, he was the late Emperor of blessed memory, a sainted soul,\r\nthe very spirit or genius of eternal Rome. The traditions in early\r\nRoman history of the god-born and deified founder, the hero-worship of\r\nGreece, the veil which concealed (as it still conceals) the state of the\r\ndeparted, combined with the tolerant spirit of polytheism to make it\r\nalmost as easy for the men of that time to admit a new deity into the\r\nOlympian hierarchy, as for medi\xc3\xa6val Europe to admit a new saint into the\r\nCalendar.\r\n\r\nAugustus, as we said, had the good sense and modesty to put difficulties\r\nin the way of this worship in Rome and Italy. It was another matter\r\nin the provinces. The divine, or semi-divine, honours paid him there\r\nwere closely bound up with loyalty to Rome and a belief in her eternal\r\nmission. He therefore allowed temples and altars to be built, but always\r\non the understanding that the name of Rome should be associated with\r\nhis own. Such a method of expressing devotion to Rome and reverence for\r\nher magistrates had not been unknown in earlier times. In the second\r\ncentury B.C. a colossal statue of Rome had been set up by the Rhodians in\r\na temple of Athena; the people of Chalcis had erected a temple in honour\r\nof Flamininus; and Cicero implies that in his time it was not an uncommon\r\nthing to do in the Asiatic provinces. At Smyrna a temple to Rome had\r\nbeen erected in B.C. 195;[276] and even before these the communities in\r\nAsia and Greece had been accustomed to honour the Ptolemies in a similar\r\nmanner. The new cult therefore had nothing strange to the feelings and\r\nhabits of the time. It began early in his career of success\xe2\x80\x94not later at\r\nmost than B.C. 36, after the defeat of Sextus Pompeius[277]\xe2\x80\x94and it spread\r\nrapidly. We hear of temples \xe2\x80\x9cto Rome and Augustus,\xe2\x80\x9d or altars, at Cyme,\r\nAncyra, Pergamus, Nicomedia, Alexandria, Paneas, Sparta, and elsewhere\r\nin the East. Connected with them were yearly festivals and games, as at\r\nAthens, Ancyra, and in Cilicia.[278] Nor was it in the East only that\r\nthis worship began in the lifetime of Augustus. We hear of temples or\r\naltars in Spain, M\xc5\x93sia, Pannonia, Narbonne; and the altar at Lugdunum\r\n(Lyon), consecrated by Drusus in B.C. 12, was deliberately intended to\r\nsupersede the Druidical religion which was national and separatist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The attitude of Augustus to this worship.]\r\n\r\nFor forming an estimate of Augustus himself it is of great interest to\r\ndecide, if possible, how far he was deluded, how far he was acting from\r\ndeliberate policy in countenancing these things. When some people of\r\nTarraco reported to him, as an omen of his victorious career, that a\r\npalm had grown on the mound of his altar in that city, he replied with\r\nhalf-grave, half-playful irony, \xe2\x80\x9cThat shews how often you use it!\xe2\x80\x9d[279]\r\nBut there is no note of disapproval or abnegation in the answer. He\r\naccepts it as a natural fact that there should be such an altar, as a\r\nmodern sovereign might accept the compliment of a statue. Can we explain\r\nit, except as a case of conscious fraud or blinding vanity? I believe\r\nwe may. We must notice first that Augustus had been zealous in the\r\napotheosis of Iulius, had urged Antony to become his flamen, had built\r\na temple to him in Rome, and encouraged the building of temples and\r\naltars elsewhere. Now this apotheosis and worship of Iulius had begun\r\nbefore his death,[280] as Augustus knew perfectly well. But in spite of\r\nthe manifestly party spirit of the packed Senate that voted the divine\r\nhonours to Iulius, he gave no sign of revulsion or incredulity. On the\r\ncontrary, he professed himself the heir not only of his wealth and\r\nhonours, but also of his religious obligations and political purposes.\r\nIt is clear, again, that Augustus believed in the gods, that is, in some\r\nimmortal being or beings who governed and controlled the world. The\r\nrestorer of a hundred temples, of sacred writings and ancient religious\r\nrites, the pious fulfiller of vows made in the hour of danger or escape,\r\nmay have had crude or uncertain beliefs, have held views philosophical or\r\nsuperstitious, wise or foolish, but he could hardly have been an atheist.\r\n\r\nHe was too busy a man to be much troubled with philosophic doubts,\r\nand perhaps\xe2\x80\x94obvious as it may be\xe2\x80\x94the answer of Napoleon would have\r\nrepresented his view: who after listening for a time to certain\r\natheistic arguments, said, pointing to the starry heavens, \xe2\x80\x9cAll very\r\nwell, gentlemen, but who made all that?\xe2\x80\x9d Given a belief in oneself and\r\nin Providence, the next step is to believe that Providence is on our\r\nside, as Cromwell saw the hand of God even in his most questionable\r\nachievements. If we can translate this into the language of an age\r\naccustomed to hear at any rate with acquiescence of heroic men, sons of\r\nthe gods and destined to be enrolled among their peaceful ranks, of the\r\ngenius which attended each man from the cradle to the grave, of the care\r\nof the gods for the welfare of the state in its darkest hours, manifested\r\nby omens, warnings, and even material appearances: if again we consider\r\nhow much it adds to the strength of a belief to find it shared by others\r\nand to see that it makes for the moral good of the world, we may come\r\nfaintly to conceive a frame of mind in Augustus on this subject which\r\nneed not\xe2\x80\x94in view of his age and its sentiments\xe2\x80\x94be set down either as\r\nwholly irrational or wholly hypocritical. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Roman Empire,\xe2\x80\x9d he might\r\nsay to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cis all that really matters in the world. I am divinely\r\nappointed to restore and defend it. I have in fact secured its peace\r\nand prosperity. If the people call me god, it is their way of honouring\r\nthe Genius that directs me, the Providence that has selected me to be\r\ntheir benefactor and saviour. If they believe in that, they must also\r\nbelieve in the sanctity and eternal authority of Rome and the Empire.\r\nReligion and loyalty are but different words for the same virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nhis eyes the state was divinely appointed, even in itself divine, and in\r\nso far as he represented the state he was a divinity to its subjects.\r\nStability was its first requisite. \xe2\x80\x9cMy highest ambition,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an\r\nedict, \xe2\x80\x9cis to be called the author of an ideally good constitution, and\r\nto carry with me to the grave a hope that the foundations I have laid\r\nwill remain unmoved.\xe2\x80\x9d Goodness, and loyalty to the state, had become\r\nconvertible terms to him. Once as he was looking at a villa formerly\r\nbelonging to Cato, one of his companions, thinking to please him by\r\ndenouncing an anti-C\xc3\xa6sarean, spoke of the \xe2\x80\x9cobstinate wrong-headedness of\r\nCato.\xe2\x80\x9d But he answered gravely \xe2\x80\x9cany one who is opposed to revolution is\r\na good man as well as a good citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d At another time he came upon one\r\nof his grandsons reading a book of Cicero. The boy, thinking he was on\r\nforbidden ground, tried to conceal the book; but Augustus took it into\r\nhis hand, read in it a short time, and handed it back with the remark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA true scholar, my boy, and a patriot.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps he thought with remorse\r\nof his own part in the great man\xe2\x80\x99s death, perhaps of the time when he\r\nbelieved him to have been false to himself, but \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca lover of his\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94made up for all.[281]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The civilitas of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, again, that it was not personal vanity or a desire for\r\nadulation that actuated Augustus. He disliked fulsome compliments or\r\noverstrained titles of respect, and laughed at cringing attitudes,\r\nas when he said of some obsequious petitioner that \xe2\x80\x9che held out his\r\nbillet and then snatched it away again like a man giving a penny to an\r\nelephant.\xe2\x80\x9d He specially objected to be called _dominus_, a word properly\r\napplying to a master of slaves, and forbade the word to be used even\r\nin jest in his own family. He wished to be regarded as a citizen among\r\ncitizens. He took care to shew interest (unlike Iulius) in the games\r\nand shows that were liked by the people, and disapproved of special\r\nmarks of respect being paid to his young grandsons by the people rising\r\nand cheering when they entered the circus. He went through the streets\r\non foot even when Consul, or rode with the curtains of his sedan drawn\r\nback, that he might not seem to avoid the looks or approach of the\r\ncrowd; he admitted all kinds of people without distinction of rank\r\nto his morning levees; forbade the Senators to rise when he entered\r\nor left the house; visited friends without state, and was careful to\r\nattend family festivities such as betrothal parties. At elections he\r\nwent round with his candidates and canvassed for votes, and appeared\r\nfor his clients in the courts (though anxious not to allow his presence\r\nto exercise an unfair influence) and shewed no annoyance at being\r\ncross-questioned and refuted. In the Senate he allowed great freedom of\r\nspeech without resentment. He was interrupted while speaking by cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI would contradict you if it were of any use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOn one occasion, when he was leaving the house with some signs of anger\r\nafter a tiresome debate, he was followed by cries, \xe2\x80\x9cSenators should be\r\nallowed to speak freely on public affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d something like the shouts\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cPrivilege\xe2\x80\x9d that greeted Charles I. on a famous occasion. When he\r\nmildly remonstrated with Antistius Labeo for nominating Lepidus (whom he\r\nparticularly disliked and treated with great contumely) to the Senate,\r\nAntistius retorted rudely, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one is entitled to his own opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas tolerant of such language and wrote a soothing note to Tiberius, who\r\nexpressed himself vehemently about some occurrence of the sort: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear\r\nTiberius, don\xe2\x80\x99t give way to youthful excitement, or be so very indignant\r\nat some one being found to speak harm of me. It is quite enough if we can\r\nprevent their _doing_ us any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d In matters more personal or private\r\nhe could stand a telling or rough retort. When holding a review of the\r\nequites he brought up a number of charges against a certain eques, who\r\nrebutted them one after the other and ended with the contemptuous remark:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext time, sir, you cause inquiries to be made about a respectable\r\nman, you had better intrust the business to respectable people.\xe2\x80\x9d Seeing\r\nanother eques eating in the circus he sent a message to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I want\r\nto lunch, I go home.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are not afraid of\r\nlosing your place.\xe2\x80\x9d Another eques was rebuked by him for squandering his\r\npatrimony, and deigned no further remark than, \xe2\x80\x9cOh well, I was under the\r\nimpression that it was my own property.\xe2\x80\x9d He once paid a Senator\xe2\x80\x99s debts,\r\nand got no more thanks than a note with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cNot a farthing for\r\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d A young man was once noticed at Court with an extraordinary\r\nlikeness to himself. Augustus ordered him to be introduced and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung gentleman, was your mother ever at Rome?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nmy father was.\xe2\x80\x9d In this case it must be acknowledged that the Emperor\r\nrichly deserved the retort. The point, however, in all these stories\r\nis that he was content to give and take and be a man among men. There\r\nwould be no longer any ground for Pollio\xe2\x80\x99s remark, when Augustus wrote\r\nsome satirical epigrams upon that incarnation of all the talents: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsay nothing. It is not easy to write against a man who can write one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname in a proscription list.\xe2\x80\x9d There are other anecdotes which still\r\nfarther illustrate this human side of Augustus. A veteran begged him\r\nto appear for him in court, and Augustus named one of his friends to\r\nundertake the case. The veteran cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cBut when you were in danger\r\nat Actium, C\xc3\xa6sar, I did not get a substitute; I fought for you myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWith a blush Augustus consented to appear. The troubles and tragedies\r\nof life interested him. On hearing of one of Herod\xe2\x80\x99s family executions,\r\nhe remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI had rather be Herod\xe2\x80\x99s pig than his son!\xe2\x80\x9d And when a man\r\nsupposed to be rich was found on his death to be overwhelmed with debt,\r\nhe sent to purchase his pillow at the auction, which had enabled him to\r\nsleep when he owed such enormous sums. He could bear to have the laugh\r\nturned against himself. The story of the man with the two ravens, one\r\ntaught to greet himself and the other Antony, has been already referred\r\nto (p. 119). Another is of a similar kind. A poor Greek poet was in\r\nthe habit of waylaying him as he left his house for the forum with\r\ncomplimentary epigrams to thrust into his hand. Augustus took no notice\r\nfor some time, but one day seeing the inevitable tablet held out he took\r\nit and hastily scribbled a Greek epigram of his own upon it. The poet by\r\nvoice and look affected to be overpowered with admiration, and running up\r\nto the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s sedan handed him a few pence, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cBy heaven above\r\nyou, Augustus, if I had had more I would have given it you!\xe2\x80\x9d Everybody\r\nlaughed and Augustus ordered his steward to give him a substantial sum of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that though Augustus was unmoved by rough retorts or\r\noffensive speeches he shewed considerable sensitiveness to attacks\r\nwhich took the form of lampoons and epigrams. He went so far on some\r\noccasions as to refute them in an edict. But he used the \xe2\x80\x9cedict\xe2\x80\x9d as a\r\nmeans of communication with the citizens and provinces on all sorts of\r\nsubjects, such as for explaining his purpose in putting up the bust\r\nof distinguished men, or to draw attention to what he thought useful\r\nin ancient writers. But he shrank not only from offensive poems, but\r\nfrom being the subject of any poetry or history composed by incompetent\r\npeople. Before all things he was not to be made to look ridiculous by\r\nwitty attacks or clumsy praise. The prize poem or declamation was an\r\nabomination to him, and the pr\xc3\xa6tors were charged to prevent the public\r\nuse of his name in such compositions. Connected with this sensitive\r\nrefinement of taste may be mentioned the simplicity of his manners and\r\nway of life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The residences of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Augustus, though in a group of great splendour, was not in\r\nitself on a scale approaching the huge constructions of later Emperors.\r\nHe appears at first to have occupied a modest house close to the forum,\r\nwhich had once belonged to the orator Licinius Calvus, who died B.C. 47.\r\nHe then purchased a site on the Palatine on which to erect a new house;\r\nbut in B.C. 36, after the final defeat of Sextus Pompeius, the Senate\r\nvoted him the house of Hortensius. In a chamber of this house he slept\r\nsummer and winter for the rest of his life, though occasionally when\r\nunwell he would pass the night in the house of M\xc3\xa6cenas on the Esquiline\r\nwhich was regarded as a healthier situation. On receiving this house\r\nfrom the Senate, he devoted the site already purchased to the temple of\r\nApollo and its libraries, which with its peristyle was filled with the\r\nmost precious specimens of Greek art, and in which under the statue of\r\nApollo by Scopas the Sibylline books were preserved in gilded caskets.\r\nIn B.C. 12, upon becoming Pontifex Maximus, he built a small temple of\r\nVesta between these buildings and his house, to keep up the tradition\r\nof the Pontiff residing near the shrine of Vesta in the forum, while he\r\nhanded over the official residence of the Pontiff to the Vestal Virgins\r\nthemselves. The house of Hortensius was afterwards partly destroyed by\r\nfire and rebuilt with greater magnificence, the neighbouring house once\r\nowned by Catiline being taken in; but even then it was on a moderate\r\nscale compared with the later palaces. Its entrance, however, was\r\nconspicuously marked by the laurels, the civic crown, and gilded shields\r\nwhich were placed there by vote of the Senate since B.C. 27. Besides this\r\ntown-house, which has furnished the name for a royal residence to this\r\nday, he had of course various villas in different parts of Italy. But\r\nthey were not numerous in comparison with the number we know to have been\r\nowned by nobles at the end of the republic. There was one at the ninth\r\nmilestone on the Flaminian Way called _ad gallinas_, in the gardens of\r\nwhich was the bay tree, from the leaves of which Augustus had his garland\r\nmade when celebrating his triumphs; as it became the traditional habit\r\nof succeeding Emperors to do also. The others near Rome were selected\r\nfor their coolness and healthy position\xe2\x80\x94Lanuvium twenty miles from the\r\ncity on a lofty spur of the Alban Mountains, \xe2\x80\x9ccold Pr\xc3\xa6neste\xe2\x80\x9d twenty-five\r\nmiles, and \xe2\x80\x9csloping Tibur\xe2\x80\x9d about twenty miles away. These, however, were\r\nsuburban residences and gave no escape from society or business. They\r\nwere full of Roman villas,[282] and in the temple of Hercules at Tibur he\r\nfrequently sat to administer justice. When he could get a real holiday he\r\npreferred a yachting voyage among the islands on the Campanian coast.\r\nFor one of them (\xc3\x86naria) he took in exchange from the municipality\r\nof Naples the beautiful Capre\xc3\xa6, destined for greater notoriety under\r\nhis successor. He used to call it or some small island in the bay his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCastle of Idleness.\xe2\x80\x9d[283] His villas were on a modest scale. He greatly\r\ndisapproved of the vast country palaces which were becoming the fashion,\r\nand forced his granddaughter to demolish one which she was building.[284]\r\nEarlier in life he was accused of extravagance in the matter of rich\r\nfurniture and antique bronzes. But he seems to have shaken off this\r\nweakness later on. The furniture of his villas was extremely simple, and\r\nthere were no costly pictures and statues in them, but the gardens were\r\ncarefully laid out with terraces and shrubberies, and generally adorned\r\nwith various curiosities, as at Capre\xc3\xa6 with the huge bones of a whale.\r\n\r\nHis table was simple and the dinners never long. He was careful in\r\nselecting his company, but knew how to make graceful concessions as to\r\nthe rank of his guests when occasion required it. He drank little wine,\r\nand generally not of the best vintages; but he exerted himself to promote\r\nconversation and to draw out the silent and shy. He would sometimes come\r\nlate and retire early without breaking up the party; sometimes talked\r\ninstead of eating, taking his own simple food before or after the meal.\r\nBefore all he does not appear to have adopted the unsociable habit, often\r\nmentioned by Cicero and especially characteristic of Iulius, of reading\r\nand answering his letters at table. The dinner was generally a family\r\nfunction and his young grandsons were always present at it. Sometimes\r\nconversation was varied by reciters, readers, actors or professors of\r\nphilosophy. But at the Saturnalia and other festivals the quiet and\r\ndecorum of these meals gave way to the spirit of the hour. The table was\r\nbetter furnished and the Emperor presented his guests with all kinds of\r\ngifts, or amused himself by holding a kind of blind auction, putting\r\ntogether lots of widely different value which the guests bid for without\r\nknowing what they were purchasing. On such occasions gambling with dice\r\nwas permitted, though in family parties the Emperor took care to lose or\r\nto surrender his winnings, and sometimes he supplied each member of the\r\nparty with a sum of money beforehand with which to make their stakes. But\r\ngames of chance had a fascination for him at all times of his life, and\r\nhis real gambling was not confined to festival days. He made no secret\r\nof it, and we hear nothing of any great loss or gain. Social life at\r\nRome began early in the day, visitors at a levee would arrive soon after\r\ndaybreak, and a magistrate would sometimes have to be up immediately\r\nafter midnight, to take omens or perform some other religious rite. But\r\nas Augustus worked late at night, and was not a good sleeper, early\r\nrising was painful to him, and resulted in his falling fast asleep in\r\nhis sedan. If any of these night duties became imperative he took the\r\nprecaution of sleeping in some lodging near the place. But his normal\r\nhabit was to work up to noon, then after the light luncheon or prandium,\r\noften consisting of bread and a few grapes, to sleep for a short time\r\nfully dressed. Having finished the morning\xe2\x80\x99s work and bath, dinner (cena)\r\nwould come between 3 and 4, though busy men like the Emperor often pushed\r\nit on to 6 or 7; after dinner he went to his study, and there finished\r\noff what was left of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work, his memoranda and accounts, sitting\r\nor reclining on his couch far into the night. The amount of work which\r\nhe must have bestowed upon his official business is shewn by the state\r\nof readiness and completeness in which the various schedules of the\r\nfinances of the Empire and the army, and the book of political maxims\r\nwere found at his death. In early youth he had dabbled in literature,\r\nand composed a tragedy in the Greek fashion called \xe2\x80\x9cAjax\xe2\x80\x9d; but coming\r\nin later years to estimate its value more truly he destroyed it, and\r\nwhen some friend or flatterer inquired for it, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAjax has fallen\r\non his own sponge.\xe2\x80\x9d[285] He composed also memoirs of his own life, but\r\nthey were interrupted by his serious illness after the Spanish War (B.C.\r\n25-3), and never resumed. They were used by Suetonius and other writers,\r\nas well as collections of his letters, edicts, and speeches, but have not\r\nbeen preserved. Only one of his epigrams has survived, of which I shall\r\nspeak hereafter. These excursions into literature, never very serious,\r\nseem to have ceased as he got on in life. In the third book of his _Odes_\r\n(written between B.C. 30-25), Horace tells the Muses that \xe2\x80\x9cthey afford a\r\nrecreation to high C\xc3\xa6sar when he has put his troops into winter quarters\r\nand seeks a rest from toil,\xe2\x80\x9d[286] but in the fourth book (B.C. 13-12)\r\nit is the statesman, the conqueror, and reformer that he addresses, not\r\nthe man of letters. The Epistle addressed to Augustus in B.C. 12, though\r\nit deals with literary criticism and explicitly supports the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwell-known dislike of being the theme of inferior writers, while it\r\ndwells upon his numerous employments and warmly compliments him on his\r\nsuccessful achievements, contains no word or hint of his authorship.[287]\r\nThe principate was a most laborious profession, absorbing all his\r\nenergies and occupying all his time, and though he might enjoy the\r\ncompany of literary men, despatches, edicts, and state papers would now\r\nbe the limit of his literary ambition.\r\n\r\nThe heavy work of his lofty position was performed under painful\r\nconditions of health. Besides at least four serious illnesses[288]\r\nof which we hear, he was subject to periodical complaints, generally\r\nrecurring at the beginning of spring and autumn. Soon after B.C. 30 he\r\ngave up the martial exercises of the Campus, then the less fatiguing\r\nball games, and finally confined himself to getting out of his sedan to\r\ntake short runs or walks. As he grew old his only outdoor amusements\r\n(except yachting) seem to have been fishing and playing games with little\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of his life he gave up going into Roman society.\r\nIn the earlier part of his principate he dined out freely, and not\r\nalways in select company. He seems to have been rather inclined to the\r\nvulgar millionaire, perhaps because he could reckon on contributions to\r\nthe public objects which he had at heart. He did not expect splendid\r\nentertainments, and was content with the wine of the district, still he\r\ndid not like being treated with too little ceremony. To one man who gave\r\nhim a dinner ostentatiously plain and common, he remarked on leaving\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndid not know that I was such an intimate friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d At times,\r\ntoo, he had occasion to assume the Emperor with some of these _nouveaux\r\nriches_, as in the celebrated case of Vedius Pollio. This man had a\r\nstewpond of lampreys, which he fed with flesh. When he was entertaining\r\nAugustus on one occasion the cup-bearer dropped a valuable crystal\r\ncup, and his master ordered him at once to be thrown to the lampreys.\r\nAugustus tried to beg him off, but when Pollio refused, he ceased to\r\nentreat; assuming imperial airs he ordered all the cups of the same\r\nsort in the house, and all others of value, to be brought into the room\r\nand broken. Licinius, the grasping procurator of Gaul, was another of\r\nthese rich vulgar people, with whom Augustus was somewhat too intimate,\r\nand expected in return for that honour large contributions to his\r\nworks. On one occasion he even took the liberty of altering the figure\r\nin the promissory note sent by him so as to double the sum. Licinius\r\nsaid nothing, but on the next occasion he sent a note thus expressed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise towards the expense of the new work\xe2\x80\x94whatever your Highness\r\npleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWit is seldom kind, and some of the retorts attributed to him are not\r\nalways exceptions to the rule. To a humpbacked advocate pleading before\r\nhim, and often repeating the expression, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think I am wrong in\r\nany way, pray set me straight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can give you some advice,\r\nbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t set you _straight_.\xe2\x80\x9d To an officer who made rather too\r\nmuch fuss about his services, and kept pointing to an ugly scar on his\r\nforehead, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you run away you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMore good-natured are the following. To a young prefect who was being\r\nsent home from camp for misbehaviour, and who exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I go\r\nhome? What am I to say to my father?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cTell him that you did\r\nnot like me.\xe2\x80\x9d To another who was being cashiered, and pleaded to have\r\nthe usual good-service pension, that people might think he had left the\r\nservice in the usual way, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, give out that you have received\r\nthe money; I won\xe2\x80\x99t say that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough affable to all, and neither an unkind nor unreasonable master to\r\nhis slaves, or patron to his freedmen, he was enough a man of his age not\r\nto hesitate to inflict cruel punishment for certain offences. A secretary\r\nwho had taken a bribe to disclose some confidential paper, he ordered to\r\nhave his legs broken. A favourite freedman was forced to commit suicide\r\nwhen detected in intrigues with Roman married ladies. He ordered the\r\npersonal servants of his grandson Caius, who had taken advantage of his\r\nillness and death to enrich themselves in the province of Syria, to be\r\nthrown into the sea with weights attached to their feet.\r\n\r\nTo those who had been his friends there is hardly any instance of extreme\r\nseverity after the end of the civil wars. It is possible that Mur\xc3\xa6na\r\ndied before trial, though his fellow-conspirator was put to death.\r\nCornelius Gallus, the first prefectus of Egypt, committed suicide rather\r\nthan confront the accusations brought against him and the evident animus\r\nof the Senate; but Augustus did not wish it, and exclaimed with tears in\r\nhis eyes that it was hard that he should be the only man who might not be\r\nangry with his friends without the matter going farther than he intended.\r\nThe coldness that arose between him and his ministers Agrippa and M\xc3\xa6cenas\r\nwas only temporary and never very grave. He deeply deplored their loss\r\nat their death. We shall have to discuss his conduct to his daughter and\r\ngranddaughter and their paramours in another chapter. But neither in\r\nregard to these persons nor the conspirators against his life did he ever\r\nact in a way that his contemporaries would think cruel.\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes of Augustus do not suggest a very heroic figure, very\r\nquick wit, or great warmth of heart. They rather indicate what I conceive\r\nto be the truer picture, a cool and cautious character, not unkindly\r\nand not without a sense of humour; but at the same time as inevitable\r\nand unmoved by pity or remorse as nature herself. No one accuses him of\r\nhaving neglected or hurried any task that it was his duty to perform.\r\nBut neither friend, relation, nor minister ever really influenced him.\r\nHe issues orders, and they all obey instinctively, without remonstrance,\r\nand generally with success. He is providence to them all. Everything\r\nsucceeds under his hands. He is no soldier, though he knows one when he\r\nsees him, but all the nations of the earth seek his friendship. Till the\r\nlast decade of his life no serious reverse befel his armies; at home all\r\nopposition melted away, as the difficulties in a road or course disappear\r\nbefore a skilful driver or steerer. He is not godlike, but there is an\r\nair of calm success about him which swayed men\xe2\x80\x99s wills and awakened their\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMER AND LEGISLATOR\r\n\r\n    _Quid leges sine moribus_\r\n    _van\xc3\xa6 proficiunt?_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The earliest reforms in the Empire.]\r\n\r\nThe activity of Augustus as reformer in the city and Italy, and to a\r\ngreat extent in the provinces also, was subsequent to the settlement of\r\nhis constitutional position in B.C. 23, after which date changes in it\r\nwere generally consequential, and in matters of detail. But it began\r\nlong before. In B.C. 36 he had taken effective measures to suppress the\r\nbrigandage which had pushed its audacity nearly up to the very gates\r\nof Rome. In B.C. 34-3 Agrippa, under his influence, had started the\r\nimprovement in the water supply of Rome by restoring the Aqua Marcia;\r\nhad cleansed and enlarged the cloac\xc3\xa6, repaired the streets, and begun\r\nmany important buildings. In B.C. 31 we have evidence that Augustus\r\nwas turning his attention to the details of administration in the\r\nprovinces,[289] and in the next year, in his resettlement of Asia, he\r\nrestored to Samos, Ephesus, Pergamus, and the Troad, works of art which\r\nAntony had taken from them to bestow upon Cleopatra.[290] In B.C. 28,\r\nmeasures of relief were adopted for state debtors, and a term fixed\r\nbeyond which those who were in actual possession of properties could not\r\nbe disturbed by legal proceedings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTUS AS SENATOR.\r\n\r\n_Photographed from the Statue in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence._\r\n\r\n_To face page 212._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The roads and police patrols, B.C. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe first need of the country was security. How difficult this had long\r\nbeen to maintain, and how ill the senatorial government at the end of the\r\nRepublic had been able to cope with the evil is shewn by the fact that\r\nremnants of the bands of Spartacus and Catiline were in B.C. 61 still\r\ninfesting the district of Thurii. In spite of the repressive measures\r\nof B.C. 36, which seem to have been successful as far as the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Rome was concerned, at the end of the civil war armed\r\nbands still openly appeared in various parts of Italy, seized and carried\r\noff travellers, confined them in the slave-barracks, or _ergastula_,\r\nor put them to ransom. These _ergastula_ were originally slave-prisons\r\nused for keeping refractory slaves, who worked during the day in chains,\r\nand were shut up in separate cells at night, often underground or only\r\nlighted by windows high up and out of reach of the inmates. In some\r\nparts of Italy\xe2\x80\x94chiefly the north\xe2\x80\x94they were not known, and chained slaves\r\nwere not employed; but in other parts they were numerous, and afforded\r\nconvenient hiding-places. The chief abuse connected with them was that\r\nmen properly free could be carried off and concealed in them as though\r\nthey were slaves, while they afforded a leader in rebellion convenient\r\nsources from which to draw recruits; the miserable inmates being only\r\ntoo ready to join any one who gave them a hope of freedom and release\r\nfrom those horrible dens. Accordingly a review of the _ergastula_ is\r\nconstantly heard of, till they were finally abolished by Hadrian. Among\r\nthe measures for the suppression of brigandage now taken was a visitation\r\nof these places. It was not done in mercy to the slaves. Augustus, though\r\nhe treated his own servants with kindness, took the sternest Roman view\r\nof the absolute power of a master, and boasts that after the war with\r\nSextus Pompeius he handed over 30,000 slaves\xe2\x80\x94who had been serving with\r\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x94to their masters \xe2\x80\x9cto be punished.\xe2\x80\x9d[291] When we remember what\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cpunishment\xe2\x80\x9d of a Roman slave meant, it is difficult to think without\r\nhorror of the sum total of human misery which this implies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great roads of Italy secured.]\r\n\r\nA more effective and permanent measure, however, was to secure the\r\nroads and make them fit for rapid military movements. A system of road\r\ncommissions (_cur\xc3\xa6 viarum_) was started in B.C. 27, commissioners\r\n(_curatores_) being appointed to superintend each of the great roads\r\nleading from Rome to various parts of Italy. The duty at first was\r\nusually imposed upon men who had enjoyed triumphs, and Augustus himself,\r\nafter his triple triumph, undertook the _via Flaminia_, the great north\r\nroad from Rome to Ariminum on the Adriatic, from which place other roads\r\nbranched off through the valley of the Po, and to the Alpine passes. The\r\npavement of the road was relaid, the bridges repaired, and the completion\r\nof the work was commemorated by the still existing arch at Rimini, with\r\nits partially surviving inscription.[292] For greater safety, also,\r\nmilitary pickets were stationed at convenient points along the roads,\r\nwhich put a stop to brigandage.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with the roads were the twenty-eight military\r\ncolonies established by Augustus in Italy. Of these seven were along the\r\nline of the Flaminia, or near it; one of them (Bononia) was the point\r\nwhere the main roads to Rome converge. Others guarded the entrances to\r\nthe Alpine passes, or the road through Venetia to Istria\xe2\x80\x94which Augustus\r\nincluded in Italy\xe2\x80\x94while another group protected the main roads through\r\nCampania. Thus these colonies were not only centres of loyalty to the\r\nEmpire, but served to keep open the great routes. The object of the\r\ndivision of Italy into eleven regions, the exact date of which is not\r\nknown, was probably for the purpose of the census, and the taxation\r\nwhich was connected with it, but it was also for other administrative\r\npurposes, as for the regulation of the military service of the young\r\nmen in each of them.[293] The regions followed the natural divisions of\r\nthe country and of nationalities, but the importance of the roads in\r\nconnection with them is shown by the fact that before long they became\r\nknown in many cases by the name of the chief road that traversed them,\r\nas \xc3\x86milia, Flaminia, and others. What Augustus was doing for Italy his\r\nlegates under his authority were doing for the most important provinces.\r\nGreat roads\xe2\x80\x94_vi\xc3\xa6 August\xc3\xa6_\xe2\x80\x94were being laid everywhere. We have evidence of\r\nthem from inscribed tablets in Dalmatia, Pisidia, and Cilicia, B\xc3\xa6tica,\r\nNorthern Spain, Gallia Narbonensis, and elsewhere.[294] These works\r\nwent on throughout his reign, but in B.C. 20 he commemorated his formal\r\nappointment as head commissioner of all roads by placing a pillar covered\r\nwith gilded bronze in the forum near the temple of Saturn, with the\r\ndistances of all the chief places along the great roads from one of the\r\nthirty-seven city gates from which these roads branch out. The base of\r\nthis _milliarium aureum_ is still in its place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The collegia.]\r\n\r\nAnother source of mischief were the _collegia_, or guilds. Under cover\r\nof promoting the interests of certain trades and professions these\r\nguilds were used, or were believed to be used, for all kinds of illegal\r\npurposes. Some of them were of great antiquity, but they had come to\r\nbe so often misused for political terrorism (especially the _collegia\r\nopificum_) that the Senate had suppressed many of them in B.C. 63. But\r\nClodius shortly afterwards got a law passed authorising their meetings,\r\nand he employed them freely for promoting his own riotous proceedings.\r\nIulius C\xc3\xa6sar had dissolved all except the most ancient and respectable,\r\nbut during the civil wars they seem to have revived. Under a law passed\r\nin B.C. 22 Augustus held a visitation of them. Some were dissolved and\r\nsome reformed, and a licence was henceforth required from Senate and\r\nEmperor for their meetings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feeding the city.]\r\n\r\nIn the city itself the first need was food. It depended very largely on\r\nimported corn. Again and again we hear of dearth and famine prices at\r\nRome. The people, often, no doubt, rightly, believed that this dearness\r\nof provisions arose from artificial causes. When Sextus Pompeius and\r\nhis confederates were scouring the seas and pouncing upon corn-ships\r\nthe cause was clear enough, and the gratitude to Augustus for crushing\r\nhim was very natural. But even when there was no such evident danger\r\ngreat distress was often caused by sudden rise of prices. The idea\r\nhad always been in such times to appoint some powerful man _pr\xc3\xa6fectus\r\nannon\xc3\xa6_, with a naval force enabling him to secure that the corn fleets\r\nshould have free passage to Italy, should be able to unload their\r\ncargoes without difficulty, and dispose of them at a moderate price. A\r\nwell-known instance of this was the appointment of Pompey in B.C. 57.\r\nBut in less troublous times a separate commissioner was appointed to\r\nwatch the several places of corn export, Sicily, Sardinia, and Africa.\r\nThese were not posts of very great dignity, and Brutus and Cassius in\r\nB.C. 44 looked upon their nomination to them as a kind of insult. But\r\nbesides the dangers of the sea and of pirates certain merchants had hit\r\nupon means\xe2\x80\x94practised long before at Athens\xe2\x80\x94of artificially raising the\r\nprice. They made what we should call \xe2\x80\x9ca corner\xe2\x80\x9d in corn. Either they\r\nbought it up and kept it back from the market, or they contrived various\r\nways of delaying the ships and producing a panic among the dealers. As\r\nin all difficulties, the people looked to Augustus for help, and in\r\nB.C. 22 begged him to accept the office of _pr\xc3\xa6fectus annon\xc3\xa6_, \xe2\x80\x9cchief\r\ncommissioner of the corn market.\xe2\x80\x9d While declining the dictatorship\r\noffered him at the same time with passionate vehemence, he accepted this\r\ncommissionership; and the law which he caused to be passed now or some\r\ntime later on shews how necessary some State interference was. By this\r\nlaw penalties were inflicted on any one \xe2\x80\x9cwho did anything to hinder the\r\ncorn supply, or entered into any combination with the object of raising\r\nits price; or who hindered the sailing of a corn-ship, or did anything of\r\n_malice propense_ whereby its voyage was delayed.\xe2\x80\x9d[295]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution of corn free or below market value.]\r\n\r\nBut besides a free and unmolested corn market, the Roman populace had\r\nlong come to look for another means of support\xe2\x80\x94a distribution of corn\r\neither altogether free or considerably below the market price. Detached\r\ninstances of this practice occur in the earlier history of Rome, the corn\r\nsometimes coming as a present from some foreign sovereign, sometimes\r\nbeing distributed by private liberality. It had always been objected to\r\nby the wiser part of the Senate, and had laid the donors open to the\r\ncharge of trying to establish a tyranny. It was reserved for the tribune\r\nGaius Gracchus to make it into a system (B.C. 122). Since his time it had\r\nbeen submitted to as a matter of course by nearly all magistrates. Sulla,\r\nindeed, seems to have suspended it for a time, but the first measure of\r\nthe counter revolution that followed his death was to re-establish it.\r\nIulius C\xc3\xa6sar had restricted it to citizens below a certain census, but\r\nhad not the courage to abolish it. It was, indeed, a kind of poor-law\r\nrelief, but of the worst possible sort. It not only induced a number of\r\nidle and useless people to prefer the chances of city life to labour\r\nin the country, but it unnaturally depressed the price of corn, and\r\ntherefore discouraged the Italian farmer, already nearly ruined by the\r\ncompetition of foreign corn; it exhausted the treasury, and, after all,\r\ndid not relieve the poor. Livy regards it as one of the causes which\r\ndenuded Italy of free cultivators, and left all the work to slaves.\r\nCicero always denounced it on much the same grounds, and Appian points\r\nout how it brought the indigent, careless, and idle flocking into the\r\ncity.[296] The system, moreover, was open to gross abuses, slaves being\r\nmanumitted that they might take their share, under contract to transfer\r\nit to their late masters. Augustus saw that by these distributions\r\ninjustice was done both to farmers and merchants, and that agriculture\r\nin Italy was being depressed by it. He says in his memoirs[297] that\r\nhe had at one time almost resolved to put a stop to the practice, but\r\nrefrained from doing so because he felt sure that the necessity of\r\ncourting the favour of the populace would induce his successors to\r\nrestore it. However unsound this reasoning may be, it would no doubt have\r\nbeen an heroic measure for one in his position to have carried out the\r\nhalf-formed resolution. As a matter of fact, his distributions were on a\r\nlarge scale, and in times of distress were entirely gratis. _Tesser\xc3\xa6_, or\r\ntickets, entitling the holders to a certain amount of corn or money, were\r\ndistributed again and again. The value of the corn tickets was generally\r\nsupplied from the _fiscus_ or his private revenue; but that after all was\r\nonly a question of accounts, it did not affect the economical or moral\r\nresults in any way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State loans.]\r\n\r\nA better economical measure was a system of State loans. Immediately\r\nafter the end of the civil war the transference to the Roman treasury of\r\nthe enormous wealth in money and jewels of the Ptolemies at Alexandria\r\ncaused the price of money to go down and the money value of landed\r\nproperty consequently to go up. For a time at least the common rate of\r\ninterest sank from 12 to 4 per cent. Augustus took advantage of this\r\nstate of things to relieve landowners who were in difficulties, by\r\nlending them money free of interest, if they could show property of\r\ndouble the value as security for repayment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tiber.]\r\n\r\nThere were other reforms equally beneficial. Among the many _cur\xc3\xa6_\r\n(commissions) which he established was one for superintending public\r\nworks, which would thus not depend on private munificence; another of the\r\nstreets; of the water supply; and, above all, of the Tiber. Rome was,\r\nas it still is, extremely subject to floods. Quite recently there were\r\nfive or six feet of water in the Pantheon, and in B.C. 27 the rise of\r\nthe Tiber was so serious that the lower parts of the city were covered,\r\nand the augurs declared it to be an omen of the universal prevalence\r\nof the power of the new _princeps_. In B.C. 23 it swept away the _pons\r\nSublicius_.[298] He could not of course prevent these floods, but he\r\ngave some relief by dredging and widening the river-bed, which was\r\nchoked with rubbish and narrowed by encroachments. The commission thus\r\nestablished remained an important one for many generations, but in B.C. 8\r\nhe superintended the business himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fire brigades.]\r\n\r\nA danger at Rome, more frequent and no less formidable than flood, was\r\nfire. So frequent were fires that the most stringent laws had been passed\r\nagainst arson, which it seems was even punishable by burning alive. In\r\nB.C. 23 Augustus formed a kind of fire brigade of public slaves under\r\nthe control of the curule-\xc3\xa6diles. But the old magistracies were no\r\nlonger objects of desire, and it was difficult to get men of energy to\r\nfill them, a state of things which was one of the chief blots in the new\r\nimperial system. At any rate in this case they were not found efficient,\r\nand in the later years of his reign (A.D. 6), a new brigade in four\r\ndivisions was formed of freedmen with an equestrian pr\xc3\xa6fect, who turned\r\nout to be so effective that they became regularly established.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sibylline Books and Sacred Colleges.]\r\n\r\nAnother part in the scheme of Augustus for the reconstruction of society\r\nwas to revive the influence of the Sacred Colleges and brotherhoods,\r\nand to renew the ceremonies with which they were connected. One method\r\nof doing this was to become a member of them all himself, much as\r\nthe king of England is sovereign of all the Orders. Thus according\r\nto the _Monumentum_ (ch. 7) he was pontifex, augur, quindecemvir for\r\nreligious rites, septemvir of the Epulones, an Arval brother, a fetial\r\nand a sodalis Titius. Nor was he only an honorary or idle member. He\r\nattended their meetings and joined in their business, and took part in\r\nwhatever rites they were intended to perform. Thus his membership of the\r\nArval brethren is recorded in the still existing _acta_; as a fetial\r\nhe proclaimed war against Cleopatra. The _sodales Titii_, a college\r\nof priests of immemorial antiquity, had almost disappeared until the\r\nentrance of Augustus into their college revived them and their ritual.\r\nHe not only joined these colleges, but revived and even increased their\r\nendowments,[299] and, above all, those of the six Vestal Virgins, to whom\r\nhe presented the _regia_, once the official residence of the Pontifex\r\nMaximus, and an estate at Lanuvium. The restoration of the College of\r\nLuperci, which had celebrated on the 15th of February the old ceremony of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbeating the bounds\xe2\x80\x9d almost from the foundation of the city, was more or\r\nless a political matter. It had gone out of fashion, and its ceremonies\r\nhad got to be looked upon as undignified. Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar had revived and\r\nre-endowed them. The Senate for that very reason in the reaction after\r\nhis death had deprived them of these endowments, which Augustus now\r\nrestored. We have already noticed his renewal of the _augurium salutis_,\r\nthe old ceremonial prayer at the beginning of the year that could only be\r\noffered in time of peace. He also induced some one to accept the office\r\nof _flamen Dialis_ in B.C. 11, after it had been vacant since B.C. 87,\r\nbecause the restrictions under which its holder laboured were so numerous\r\nand tiresome that in spite of its dignity\xe2\x80\x94its seat in the Senate and\r\ncurule chair and lictor\xe2\x80\x94no one would accept it. He took pains again\r\nto restore the Sibylline Books to their old place of importance. The\r\noriginals were lost in the fire of B.C. 82, and a commission had at once\r\nbeen issued to collect others from towns in Greece and Greek Italy. But\r\nsome of them were getting illegible from age, and some were of doubtful\r\nauthenticity, and consequently all kinds of prophetic verses got into\r\ncirculation, giving rise at times to undesirable rumours and panics.\r\nAugustus in B.C. 18 ordered them to be re-copied and edited, and the\r\nauthorised edition was then deposited in his new temple of Apollo on the\r\nPalatine, and continued to be consulted till late in the third century.\r\nAfter an attempt by Iulian to revive its authority it was finally burnt\r\nby Stilicho about A.D. 400.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pontifex Maximus.]\r\n\r\nAs one of the quindecemvirs Augustus had charge of these books, but\r\nhe formally took the official headship of Roman religion by becoming\r\nPontifex Maximus. He was elected and ordained to that office in March\r\nB.C. 12. The people had wished him to take it in B.C. 30, but he would\r\nnot violate what was a traditional and sacred rule that the office was\r\nlifelong, and though Lepidus was degraded from the triumvirate in B.C.\r\n36, he was still Pontifex Maximus. It is true that he was not allowed to\r\ndo any of the duties, or only those of the most formal kind, but still\r\nhe had the office. The ground for asking Augustus to take it was that\r\nthe election of Lepidus had been irregular; he had managed to get put in\r\nduring the confusion following the assassination of C\xc3\xa6sar, and therefore\r\nmight be deposed. Augustus however takes credit for his scrupulous\r\nobservance of a religious rule, and was particularly gratified by the\r\ncrowds of people who came up to vote for him, a sort of ecclesiastical\r\ncoronation.[300]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _ludi s\xc3\xa6culares_, May 31-June 2, B.C. 17.]\r\n\r\nIn B.C. 17 he gave an emphasis to some of these religious revivals by\r\ncelebrating the _ludi s\xc3\xa6culares_, the centenary of the city, in virtue\r\nof some verses found in this Sibylline volume. We need not trouble\r\nourselves as to whether his calculation of the year was a right one\r\n(the _s\xc3\xa6culum_ was really 110 years), it is enough to note that they\r\nwere meant, like a centenary of a college or university, to call out\r\npatriotic and loyal feelings which should embrace both the country and\r\nthe country\xe2\x80\x99s religion. They are made interesting to us by the fact\r\nthat Horace\xe2\x80\x94always ready to further his master\xe2\x80\x99s purposes\xe2\x80\x94was selected\r\nto write the Anthem or Ode to be sung by a chorus of twenty-seven boys\r\nand twenty-seven girls. An inscription, found in 1871 in the bed of the\r\nTiber, gives the official program of this festival, and ends with the\r\nwords _Carmen composuit Q. Horatius Flaccus_.[301] The poet probably\r\nhad before him, when he wrote it, the general scheme of the festival,\r\nwhich included solemn sacrifices and prayer to Iuno, Diana, Iupiter, and\r\nIlithyia. Augustus and Agrippa took the leading part in the religious\r\nfunctions\xe2\x80\x94as members of quindicemviri\xe2\x80\x94and both repeated the prayers,\r\nwhich in the case of all these deities invoked a blessing on the \xe2\x80\x9cPopulus\r\nRomanus Quiritium.\xe2\x80\x9d In short, everything was done to mark it as a\r\nnational festival, to make the Romans recall their glorious inheritance\r\nand unique position, and at the same time to show that the _princeps_\r\nrepresented that greatness before gods and men. Whatever else Augustus\r\nmay have thought of the national religion, he evidently regarded it as\r\nthe surest bond of national life, and the inclusion of a prayer to\r\nIlithyia, goddess of childbirth, joined with his contemporaneous attempt\r\nto encourage marriage and the production of children (which the obedient\r\nHorace echoes[302]), shews that he also connected that religion with\r\nmorality. The restoration of religion, in fact, in his mind, goes side\r\nby side with the purification of morals. It is the practical statesman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nview of religion as a necessary police force and perhaps something more.\r\nNapoleon restored the Catholic Church in France with a similar sagacity,\r\nand the people blessed him, as they did Augustus, for giving them back\r\n_le bon Dieu_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reformation of morals.]\r\n\r\nBut the state of things required in his judgment, not only a religious\r\nrevival, but more stringent laws. Horace again reflects his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nviews in the making, before they find expression in act. The sixth ode\r\nof the first book (written about B.C. 25) joins to the necessity of a\r\nrestoration of the temples and a return to religion a warning as to the\r\nrelaxation of morals, tracing the progress in vice of the young girl\r\nand wife, with the shameful connivance of the interested husband, and\r\nexclaims: \xe2\x80\x9cNot from such parents as these sprang the youth that dyed the\r\nsea with Punic blood, and brake the might of Pyrrhus and great Antiochus\r\nand Hannibal, scourge of God.\xe2\x80\x9d Again in the twenty-fourth ode of the\r\nsame book, also written about B.C. 25, he warmly urges a return to the\r\nold morality, and promises immortality to the statesman who shall secure\r\nit: \xe2\x80\x9cIf there be one who would stay unnatural bloodshed and civic fury,\r\nif there be one who seeks to have inscribed on his statue the title of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father of the Cities,\xe2\x80\x99 let him pluck up heart to curb licentiousness.\r\nHis shall be a name for the ages!\xe2\x80\x9d And when Augustus has acted on the\r\nresolution, to the formation of which the poet was privy, he tells him\r\nten years later that by his presence family life is cleansed from its\r\nfoul stains, that he has curbed the licence of the age and recalled\r\nthe old morality.[303] This he would represent as the result of the\r\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s legislation, the _lex marita_ of the secular hymn.\r\n\r\nIt was after his return from the East in B.C. 19 that Augustus first\r\nreceived censorial powers for five years. Whether this amounted to a\r\ndefinite office\xe2\x80\x94a _pr\xc3\xa6fectura moribus_ or _regimen morum_, as Dio and\r\nSuetonius assert\xe2\x80\x94does not much matter. The experiment of appointing\r\ncensors in the ordinary way had been tried in B.C. 22 for the last time\r\nand had not been successful, and the _censoria potestas_ now given to\r\nAugustus practically put into his hands that control over the conduct\r\nof private citizens which the censors had exercised by their power of\r\ninflicting \xe2\x80\x9cignominy\xe2\x80\x9d upon them. The ancient censorial stigma had been\r\napplied to irregularities in almost every department of life, but it\r\ndepended on the will of the censors themselves, not on laws. Feeling now\r\ndirectly responsible for the morals and general habits of the citizens he\r\nbegan a series of legislative measures designed to suppress extravagance\r\nand debauchery, and to encourage marriage and family life, which would\r\nhave permanent validity. He believed in externals, even trivial ones,\r\nas indicating a growing laxity; making, for instance, a point of men\r\nappearing in the forum and on official occasions in the old Roman toga.\r\nThe lighter and more comfortable _lacerna_ or _pallium_ was as abominable\r\nin his eyes as a suit of flannels would seem to a martinet of to-day\r\nin the Park or on parade.[304] Before all things the Romans were to be\r\nnational, in dress no less than in other respects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sumptuary laws.]\r\n\r\nBut the failure which always attends such regulations was no less\r\ninevitable in regard to the first of his new reforming measures, his\r\nsumptuary laws, regulating the exact amount that it was legal to spend\r\non a _cena_ in ordinary days, on festivals, and at wedding feasts, or\r\nthe _repotia_ which the bridegroom gave on the afternoon following his\r\nmarriage. This was no new thing. It had been tried at various times\r\nthroughout Roman history. Beginning with a very ancient law regulating\r\nthe amount of silver plate each man might legally possess, the rent he\r\nmight pay for his house, and the provisions of the Twelve Tables, we have\r\nlaws in the third and second centuries B.C., limiting the cost of dress\r\nand jewels for women, the number of guests that might be entertained at\r\nbanquets, and the amount that might be spent upon them. Sulla had also a\r\nsumptuary law, among his other acts, of the same kind. But Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nhad gone farther than any one in B.C. 46. He had not only regulated the\r\ncost of furniture and jewels, according to the rank of the owners, and\r\nthe amounts to be spent upon the table, but he had sent agents into\r\nthe provision markets, who seized all dainties beyond the legal price,\r\nand even entered private houses and removed dishes from the table. Of\r\ncourse such measures were not only annoying, they were ineffective\r\nalso. Directly he left Rome the rules were neglected. Our own Statute\r\nBook has many laws of the same kind, which rapidly became dead letters.\r\nNearly the one and only permanent effect of the old sumptuary laws had\r\nbeen to create a sentiment against large and crowded dinner parties as\r\nvulgar.[305] Nor did Augustus succeed much better. Towards the end of his\r\nreign he issued an edict extending the legal amount which might be spent\r\non banquets, hoping to secure some obedience to the law. But nothing\r\nthat we know of Roman life afterwards leads us to think that this form\r\nof paternal government\xe2\x80\x94though quite in harmony with Roman ideas\xe2\x80\x94ever\r\nattained its object. Human nature was stronger than political theory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Iulian laws of marriage, adultery and divorce.]\r\n\r\nNor were the laws, carried about the same time,[306] on marriage,\r\ndivorce, and kindred subjects, much more effective. In part they\r\nre-enacted rules which had always been acknowledged and always disobeyed,\r\nand so far as they did not punish a crime, but endeavoured to enforce\r\nmarriage, they were continually resisted or effectually evaded.\r\nThey consisted of a series of enactments\xe2\x80\x94whether we regard them as\r\nseparate laws or chapters in the same law\xe2\x80\x94for restraining adultery and\r\nlibitinage, for regulating divorce, and for encouraging the marriage of\r\nall ranks.[307] They were passed in B.C. 18-17, and were supplemented\r\nby a law of A.D. 9, called the _lex Papia Popp\xc3\xa6a_. The text of none of\r\nthem survives, and we have to trust to scattered notices in the later\r\nlegal writers. They may be roughly classed as restrictive, penal, and\r\nbeneficiary. In the first may be placed the regulation that no senator\r\nor member of a senatorial family might marry a freed-woman, courtesan,\r\nactress, or the daughter of an actor; though other men might marry a\r\nfreed-woman or even emancipate a slave in order to marry her. And under\r\nthe same head came the regulations as to divorce. The legal doctrine\r\nappears to have been that marriage contracted with the old religious\r\nceremony called _confarreatio_ was indissoluble, except in the case of\r\nthe wife\xe2\x80\x99s adultery, on whose condemnation to death the execution was\r\npreceded by a solemn dissolution of the marriage or _diffareatio_. It was\r\nalso a common belief that no divorce had ever taken place at Rome until\r\nthat of Carvilius in B.C. 231. Yet the laws of the Twelve Tables (B.C.\r\n450) contained provisions as to divorce, so that it had certainly been\r\nknown before; and perhaps the truth was that Carvilius was the first to\r\ndivorce his wife without any plea of adultery, in which case he would\r\nhave to give security for the repayment of her dowry. Since that time\r\nthe religious _confarreatio_ had become extremely rare. Both men and\r\nwomen avoided an indissoluble tie. The fashion was to be married _sine\r\nmanu_, that is, without the woman passing into the _manus_ or power of\r\nher husband. She still remained subject to the _patria potestas_, or to\r\nthat of her guardian, or was _sui iuris_ according to her circumstances\r\nat the time. Such marriages could be dissolved by either party, and\r\nwithout charge of misconduct. Public opinion seems to have restrained\r\nboth men and women for some time from taking advantage of their freedom,\r\nbut its force steadily diminished, till towards the end of the republic\r\ndivorce became so common as to provoke little remark. It was an\r\narrangement\xe2\x80\x94as in the case of Augustus and his family\xe2\x80\x94governed almost\r\nentirely by considerations of convenience or advantage, and generally\r\nleft all parties concerned on a friendly footing. This of course was\r\nnot always the case when the divorce was the result of misconduct, or\r\nat least of misconduct on the wife\xe2\x80\x99s part, nor even if it resulted\r\nfrom incompatibility of temper or money disputes, which left a feeling\r\nof soreness behind them. It was a system\xe2\x80\x94however disastrous to family\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94too deeply rooted for Augustus to attempt to change it, even if\r\nhe had wished to do so. His law seems to have dealt only with certain\r\nformalities and conditions of divorce\xe2\x80\x94such as the necessity of having\r\nwitnesses, and in case of a charge of misconduct a kind of family council\r\nor court of inquiry\xe2\x80\x94not with the freedom of divorce itself, except that\r\nin the case of a freed-woman, she was prevented from divorcing her\r\nhusband or marrying again without his consent. That, however, rested\r\non the idea of the rights of a patronus rather than on the sanctity of\r\nmarriage. Otherwise the law chiefly dealt with questions of property,\r\nrestraining the husband from alienating his wife\xe2\x80\x99s estate without her\r\nconsent, and re-enacting (with what modifications we do not know) the\r\nprovisions for the repayment of dowry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penalties (1) for adultery or seduction.]\r\n\r\nThe _penal_ enactments affected (1) those guilty of adultery or seduction\r\n(_stuprum_), and (2) those who remained unmarried or without children.\r\nIn adultery both parties were punished by transportation (_deportatio\r\nin insulam_) and a partial confiscation of property. A husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunfaithfulness incurred no penalty except that he lost all claim to\r\nretain any part of the wife\xe2\x80\x99s dowry, even for the benefit of children.\r\nBut the old barbarous principle of the injured husband\xe2\x80\x99s right to kill\r\nboth wife and paramour, if detected by himself, was retained, though\r\nunder certain conditions. If he allowed the guilty wife to remain with\r\nhim, he was bound to release the man; and if he connived at the adultery\r\nfor gain, he was subject to a fine. _Stuprum_ was formerly defined as\r\nthe forcible detention of a free woman for immoral purposes, and could\r\nbe punished by flogging or imprisonment. Under the Iulian law it was\r\nextended to the seduction of an unmarried woman or a widow who had been\r\nliving chastely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (2) For remaining unmarried.]\r\n\r\nThe penalties upon those who remained unmarried between certain ages were\r\nin the form of a direct tax or of certain disabilities. The former, under\r\nthe name of _uxorium_, was of great antiquity, and had been levied by\r\nthe censors of B.C. 404, but it was light and intermittent; the Iulian\r\nlaw revived and increased it. The disabilities were that an unmarried\r\nman between the legal ages could not take a legacy from a testator\r\nnot related to him within the sixth degree, unless he married within\r\na hundred days of being informed of the legacy. This was extended by\r\nthe _lex Papia Popp\xc3\xa6a_ (A.D. 9) to the childless, who could only take\r\nhalf any legacy from a testator unconnected with them within the sixth\r\ndegree. One child saved a man from coming under this law, three children\r\na freeborn woman, four a freed-woman. Again, a husband and wife who were\r\nchildless could only receive a tenth of a legacy left by one to the\r\nother, though, if there were children by another marriage, a tenth was\r\nadded for each, or if they had had children who had died. For all alike\r\nthere were numerous exemptions founded on absence from home on public\r\nservice, age, or ill-health; and a certain time of grace (_vacatio_) was\r\ngiven between the attainment of the legal age and the actual marriage, or\r\nbetween two marriages, or after a divorce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privileges to parents. The _ius trium liberorum_.]\r\n\r\nThe beneficiary clauses of the law were those which relieved married\r\nmen or women and men or women with children from these disabilities,\r\nand gave them exemption from certain onerous public duties and special\r\nplaces of honour in the theatres. The fathers of three children at Rome,\r\nfour in Italy, five in the provinces, had also certain preferences for\r\noffices and employments and other honorary distinctions, such as taking\r\nprecedence of a colleague in the consulship. This was not a new idea, for\r\nit had in one shape or another existed in many Greek states, and in B.C.\r\n59 Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar had in his agrarian law given the preference to fathers\r\nof three children in the distribution of land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition to the law.]\r\n\r\nThe disabilities imposed on the unmarried were met with vehement\r\nresistance, in consequence of which the clause was introduced giving\r\nthe three years\xe2\x80\x99 grace between the attainment of the legal age and the\r\nactual marriage. After the passing of the Papia Popp\xc3\xa6a (A.D. 9) the\r\nEmperor in the theatre or circus was received with loud shouts from the\r\nequestrian seats demanding its repeal. He is said to have sent for the\r\nchildren of Germanicus and held them up as an example for all to follow;\r\nand he afterwards summoned two meetings of the equites, one of those\r\nmarried, and the other of the single. To each he delivered a speech,\r\nwhich Dio reports or invents. He pointed with dismay to the fact that the\r\nfirst meeting was so much less numerous than the second. He commended\r\nthe married men for having done their duty to the State, but to the\r\nunmarried he addressed a longer and more vehement appeal. He argued that\r\nthey were defeating the purpose of the Creator, were contributing to the\r\ndisappearance of the Roman race, which was being replaced by foreigners\r\nnecessarily admitted to the franchise in order to keep up the numbers of\r\nthe citizens; that he had only followed in his legislation the precedent\r\nof ancient laws with increased penalties and rewards, and that while he\r\nacknowledged that marriage was not without its troubles, yet that was\r\ntrue of everything else, and they were compensated by other advantages\r\nand the consciousness of duty done.[308]\r\n\r\nBut though the Emperor carried his point at the time and passed a law\r\nwhich remained in force for more than three centuries, it did not really\r\nbenefit morality. It was constantly evaded by colourable marriages, often\r\nwith quite young children. \xe2\x80\x9cMen did not marry to have heirs, but in order\r\nto become heirs,\xe2\x80\x9d it was said. And though Augustus attempted to prevent\r\nthis by an edict enacting that no betrothal was to count which was not\r\nfollowed by a marriage within two years, other means of evading the law\r\nwere found which gave rise to the intrusion of spies and informers who\r\nmade their profit by thus violating the secrets of the family. Again,\r\nthe granting of the _ius trium liberorum_ became gradually a matter of\r\nform, and the idea of the superiority of the married state necessarily\r\ndisappeared with the rise of certain Christian ideals. The law was\r\nrepealed by the sons of Constantine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of Augustus in view of this legislation.]\r\n\r\nThough a line is often drawn between a man\xe2\x80\x99s public and private\r\ncharacter, it still remains hard to reconcile the earnestness of Augustus\r\nin pressing these laws and his severity in punishing offences of this\r\nnature with the reports of his own personal habits. I have already\r\nexpressed my disbelief in the stories of his youthful immoralities.\r\nSuetonius, who spares no emperor the inevitable chapter summing up his\r\nsins of the flesh, asserts that not even his friends deny the intrigues\r\nof his later years, but merely urge that they were conducted not for\r\nthe gratification of his passions, but for motives of policy, that he\r\nmight gain information of secret plots. He mentions no names and gives\r\nno evidence; the only names that have come down are those mentioned\r\nin Antony\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary letter justifying his own connection with\r\nCleopatra. Antony, however, could only have known Roman gossip at second\r\nor third hand in Alexandria, and the whole tone of the letter is so\r\nreckless and violently coarse that it goes for very little by way of\r\nevidence. Dio indeed mentions the wife of M\xc3\xa6cenas. But his statements\r\ndo not hang together or amount to very much. In one place he tells us\r\nthat Augustus was annoyed with M\xc3\xa6cenas because the latter had told his\r\nwife something as to measures being taken against her brother Murena. At\r\nanother he says that some gossips attributed his journey to Gaul in B.C.\r\n16 to a wish to enjoy her society without exciting popular remark, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nhe was so much in love with her that he once made her dispute with Livia\r\nas to the superiority in beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d Even if the gossip was worth anything,\r\nthis hardly looks like a secret intrigue. Nor is it a confirmation of\r\nit that M\xc3\xa6cenas at his death left Augustus his heir. However, the fact\r\nmay nevertheless be so. Livia is said elsewhere by Dio to have explained\r\nher lasting influence over Augustus by the fact that she was always\r\ncareful not to interfere in his affairs, and, while remaining strictly\r\nchaste herself, always pretended not to know anything of his amours. If\r\nLivia did say this, it would of course be a sufficiently strong proof of\r\nthe allegations against him. But such reported sayings rest ultimately\r\non gossip and tittle-tattle, and do not go for much. The story told\r\nby Dio, and amplified by Zonaras, of Athenodorus of Tarsus getting\r\nhimself conveyed into his chamber in the covered sedan intended for\r\nsome mistress, and springing out of it sword in hand and then appealing\r\nto Augustus as to whether he did not often run such risks, is not very\r\nlikely in itself, and at any rate must refer to the triumviral days. For\r\nabout B.C. 30 Athenodorus was sent back to govern Tarsus. The one epigram\r\nby the hand of Augustus, which has been preserved by Martial,[309] is\r\nundeniably outspoken and coarse, but it is the coarseness of disgust,\r\nnot of lubricity, and to my mind is evidence\xe2\x80\x94so far as it may be called\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94for him rather than against him. If, however, all that Suetonius and\r\nDio allege against his middle life is true, we must still remember that\r\nin the eyes of his contemporaries, and indeed in Roman society generally\r\nfrom Cato downwards, such indulgence in itself was not reprehensible. It\r\nentirely depended on circumstances, and whether other obligations\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nas friendship, public duty, family honour\xe2\x80\x94were or were not violated.\r\nFrom that point of view the only crime of Augustus would be in the case\r\nof Terentia, wife of M\xc3\xa6cenas, if the tale is true. As among the other\r\nemperors whose life Suetonius wrote, with the exception of Vespasian, the\r\ncharacter of Augustus stands out clear. One age cannot judge fairly of\r\nanother, and it is not seldom that we find ourselves at as great a loss\r\nto reconcile theory and practice, as to account for lives such as those\r\nof Augustus and Horace in conjunction with the legislation of the former\r\nand the moral sentiments occasionally expressed by the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLATER LIFE AND FAMILY TROUBLES\r\n\r\n    _Edepol, Senectus, si nil quidquam_\r\n    _aliud viti apportes tecum, cum_\r\n    _advenis, unum id sat est quod diu_\r\n    _vivendo multa qu\xc3\xa6 non volt videt._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The situation in B.C. 20-17.]\r\n\r\nAfter the restoration of the standards and prisoners from the Parthians\r\nin B.C. 20, and when the peaceful settlement of the Eastern provinces\r\nand subordinate kingdoms had been carried through or fairly started,\r\nAugustus appears to have thought that the greater part of his life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork had been accomplished. The frontiers of the Empire had been settled\r\nand secured. The Eastern provinces had been visited, necessary reforms\r\nintroduced, and great works of public utility set on foot. He wrote word\r\nto the Senate that the Empire was sufficiently extensive, and that he had\r\nno intention of adding to it by further annexations. He returned to Rome\r\nthe following year (B.C. 19) to find that the renewed trouble in Northern\r\nSpain had been settled, or was on the point of being settled, by Agrippa.\r\nHe proposed to devote himself henceforth to internal reforms and the\r\nsuperintendence of the peaceful improvements which he contemplated in the\r\nprovinces. He no doubt had in mind the necessity of a personal visitation\r\nof distant parts of the Empire from time to time; but by associating\r\nthe able and trustworthy Agrippa with himself in the tribunician power\r\n(B.C. 18) he might feel that he would always have a support in the\r\nadministration at home or abroad on which he could rely. It was at this\r\ntime, therefore, that the reforms and restorations were accomplished\r\nwhich have been described in the last chapter, crowned by the national\r\nfestival, the _ludi s\xc3\xa6culares_, in which he and Agrippa stood side by\r\nside as mouthpieces of the whole people before the gods.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, however, how these peaceful hopes were disappointed.\r\nScarcely were the secular games over than news came of the serious\r\ndisturbances in Gaul, Pannonia, Dalmatia, and Thrace, which led to his\r\nthree years\xe2\x80\x99 absence from Rome and his long residence in Gaul and Spain.\r\nHe had only returned to Rome from this absence little more than a year\r\nwhen he lost Agrippa, who died in March, B.C. 12, and he was obliged\r\nto fall back upon the support of Tiberius, as his two grandsons were\r\nonly eight and five years old respectively. It was in B.C. 11 that he\r\ncompelled him to divorce his wife, Vipsania, to whom he was devotedly\r\nattached, and marry Iulia, left a widow by Agrippa. The change was\r\nthoroughly distasteful to Tiberius. He loved Vipsania, and he had good\r\nreason to suspect Iulia of at least levity. So strong were his feelings\r\nfor his divorced wife that means had to be taken to prevent the two\r\nmeeting, for on a chance _rencontre_ he was observed to follow her with\r\nstraining eyes and tears. The arrangement, indeed, was wholly the work\r\nof Augustus, with a view to a possible failure in the succession (which\r\ndid actually occur), for by this time he had evidently imbibed the idea\r\nof a dynasty, and of the necessity of having some one connected with\r\nhim to take his place, who would be regarded as a natural successor\r\nby all classes of citizens. But it proved the origin of a sorrow and\r\nmortification which did much to overcloud his later days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULIA, DAUGHTER OF AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n_From the Bust in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence._\r\n\r\n_To face page 234._\r\n\r\nLIVIA, WIFE OF AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n_From the Bust in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence._\r\n\r\n_Page 274._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iulia, b. B.C. 39; ob. A.D. 14.]\r\n\r\nAt first, we are told, the marriage seemed likely to be a happy one.\r\nIulia accompanied her husband on his campaigns in Dalmatia (B.C. 11-10),\r\nor at any rate awaited him at Aquileia, where a child was born and\r\ndied. But from that time forward the breach between them was always\r\nwidening. Tiberius seems to have remembered certain passages that had\r\npassed between them while she was still the wife of Agrippa, and she\r\nregarded him as her social inferior, and wrote a violent complaint of\r\nhis character and habits to Augustus\xe2\x80\x94supposed to have been composed for\r\nher by her lover, Sempronius Gracchus, who paid for that service by his\r\nlife in the first year of the next reign; and when in B.C. 6 Tiberius\r\nretired to Rhodes, his motive seems to have been as much to escape her\r\ncompany as to avoid the awkwardness of his political position. Left\r\nthus to her own devices in the midst of a corrupt society, she seems\r\nsoon to have outdone all former excesses. She was beautiful\xe2\x80\x94except that\r\nshe early had grey hair\xe2\x80\x94witty and wilful: so wilful and capricious that\r\nAugustus used to say that he had \xe2\x80\x9ctwo fanciful daughters whom he was\r\nobliged to put up with\xe2\x80\x94the state and Iulia.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew round her all the\r\nrich and extravagant youth. At the amphitheatre, on one occasion, some\r\none pointed out the contrast between the respectable elderly personages\r\nwho surrounded Livia and the wild youth who formed her own train. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\nthey will grow old along with me!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. To a graver friend, who\r\nsuggested that she would do better to imitate the economical habits of\r\nher father, she retorted: \xe2\x80\x9cHe forgets that he is a C\xc3\xa6sar; I remember that\r\nI am C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d Once the Emperor entered the room while she was\r\nat her toilet and noticed that her tire women had been plucking out her\r\ngrey hairs. He stayed chatting on all kinds of subjects, and insensibly\r\nled the conversation to the subject of old age. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich would you prefer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto be grey or bald?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, grey,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you let these women make you bald so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d She had at\r\ntimes given him some unpleasant doubts as to her conduct. She came to\r\nsee him once dressed in a meretricious style, which she knew would vex\r\nhim. Next day she reappeared dressed with complete decorum. He had said\r\nnothing the day before, but now exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this a style more\r\nbecoming to a daughter of Augustus?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI dressed to-day\r\nfor my father to see, yesterday for my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had never liked her mixing in general society as a girl. She and\r\nhis granddaughters, who lived in his house, were trained to spend\r\ntheir time in women\xe2\x80\x99s work, spinning wool, and the like, and to have\r\nno secret conversations or idle talk; and he once wrote to a young\r\nnoble who had called on her while staying at Bai\xc3\xa6 that \xe2\x80\x9che had taken\r\na great liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d But in spite of such seclusion she had developed a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of and taste for literature, and her cheerful\r\ngood nature made her popular at court and in society. Her father watched\r\nher career as a married woman, and from time to time gave her half-grave\r\nand half-playful hints as to her extravagance in dress and the style of\r\npeople that surrounded her. But he does not seem to have entertained\r\nserious suspicions. Meanwhile she is said by our authorities not only\r\nto have been indulging in numerous intrigues, but to have violated all\r\npropriety and decency by joining in noisy revelry at night in the streets\r\nand forum, and to have been present at parties where men stayed late and\r\ndrank deep. The crash came at a moment that seemed a culminating one in\r\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s career, when a scandal must have been peculiarly trying.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pater patri\xc3\xa6_, B.C. 2.]\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of B.C. 8 Augustus had been at home. In that year\r\na fresh period of his various powers had been duly renewed by a vote\r\nof the Senate, which had also genie, honoured him by naming the month\r\nSextilis after him as \xe2\x80\x9cAugust,\xe2\x80\x9d and he had had the gratification of\r\nwelcoming Tiberius home from Germany victorious, and witnessing his\r\ntriumph. His young grandson Gaius was designated consul in B.C. 5 for\r\nthe sixth year from that time, and the next year he himself took that\r\noffice after an interval of eighteen years, that he might add dignity\r\nto the ceremony of Gaius taking the _toga virilis_. Though vexed at\r\nTiberius\xe2\x80\x99s retirement to Rhodes, he had good reason to hope that in the\r\ntwo young C\xc3\xa6sars the succession was well provided for. In spite of some\r\nuneasiness on the German frontier and among the Parthians, there was for\r\nthe time profound peace. At the beginning of B.C. 2 he was again consul,\r\nin order to introduce the second grandson to the forum; and to show their\r\nappreciation of his achievements, and their affection for his person, the\r\nSenate at length voted to give him the title of \xe2\x80\x9c_pater patri\xc3\xa6_.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nfirst offered him by a popular deputation in his villa at Antium. He made\r\nsome difficulty about accepting it; but the next time he appeared at the\r\ntheatre or circus he was met by loud shouts, the whole people addressing\r\nhim by that title, and at the following meeting of the Senate on the\r\n5th of February Valerius Messala was put up to address him formally:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith prayers for your person and your house, C\xc3\xa6sar Augustus\xe2\x80\x94for in\r\noffering them we deem ourselves to be praying for the perpetual felicity\r\nof the Republic and the prosperity of this city\xe2\x80\x94we, the Senate, in full\r\naccord with the Roman people, unanimously salute you as _Father of your\r\ncountry_.\xe2\x80\x9d Augustus, rising with tears in his eyes and voice, could just\r\nanswer briefly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest wishes have been fulfilled, Fathers of the\r\nSenate, and what is there left for me to ask of the immortal gods except\r\nthat I may retain this unanimous feeling of yours to the last day of my\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough the title had long been popularly applied to Augustus, this\r\nwas the first official recognition of it. It had very old historical\r\nprecedent, from Romulus to Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar. It was meant to be the highest\r\ncompliment which could be paid, but it conferred no new powers, though\r\nin after-times some of the Emperors regarded it as giving them a kind of\r\npaternal authority. Augustus was evidently highly gratified. The shows\r\ngiven at his expense this year were of unusual magnificence: gladiators,\r\nwild beast hunts, sham sea-fights on the flooded Transtiberine fields,\r\nhad all roused great enthusiasm, and a special festival in his honour\r\nhad been held at Naples\xe2\x80\x94in the Greek fashion\xe2\x80\x94as an expression of thanks\r\nto him for assistance rendered in the distress caused by a recent\r\nearthquake and eruption of Vesuvius. The year thus opened with unusual\r\ncheerfulness, and though now past sixty he might feel encouraged by the\r\npopular enthusiasm to continue his work with unabated energy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Detection of Iulia.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the disgrace that had been gathering round his house was\r\nrevealed to him. We are not told who enlightened him and turned the\r\nsuspicions which he had persistently put away into certainty. Of course\r\nthe natural suggestion is that it was Livia, between whom and Iulia,\r\nas mother of the two young heirs who stood in the way of Livia\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nTiberius, there was no cordial feeling. The contrast in their ways of\r\nlife, and the remarks caused by it, no doubt reported by good-natured\r\nfriends, had not helped to make these relations any more pleasant. But\r\nwhoever was the informant, Augustus was at last thoroughly roused, and\r\nthrown into the greatest state of agitation. Whatever may have been his\r\nown private vices in the past, the decorum of the palace in which Livia\r\npresided was unimpeached and highly valued by him. The pure atmosphere\r\nof the Augustan house\xe2\x80\x94Horace says\xe2\x80\x94and the paternal care of the Emperor\r\nwere mainly the causes of the manly characters of Tiberius and Drusus,\r\nand Horace always echoes what Augustus at any rate wished to be thought\r\ntrue. To have the secrets of the family thus revealed to the multitude,\r\nto the scorn of the hostile and the pity of the well-disposed, was no\r\ndoubt galling. He shunned society for some time and kept away from Rome.\r\nHe had also the additional annoyance of reflecting that the publicity\r\nwas greatly his own fault. In the heat of his anger he wrote to the\r\nSenate and put the affair, more or less, in its hands. In cooler moments\r\nhe repented of this, and exclaimed that \xe2\x80\x9cit would never have happened\r\nif Agrippa and M\xc3\xa6cenas had been alive.\xe2\x80\x9d Several men are said to have\r\nsuffered death on the charge, though we only know of two names, Iulius\r\nAntonius and Sempronius Gracchus, the former of whom committed suicide,\r\nwhile the latter was banished to an island on the African coast. Seneca,\r\nwho generally makes the worst of Augustus, says that he spared their\r\nlives and punished them by banishment. The case of Iulius Antonius was\r\nparticularly bad. He was the son of Antony by Fulvia, had been brought up\r\nby Octavia, married to her daughter Marcella, and by her influence and\r\nthe kindness of Augustus, had been pr\xc3\xa6tor (B.C. 13) and consul (B.C. 10).\r\nHe had therefore been treated as a member of the family, and a highly\r\nfavoured one. Gracchus is said to have begun his intrigue while Iulia\r\nwas the wife of Agrippa, and to have helped to irritate her against her\r\nhusband Tiberius. But however guilty Iulia may have been, she did not\r\nforfeit the popular affections. Again and again Augustus was assailed\r\nby petitions to recall her. He passionately refused, exclaiming at last\r\nto a more than usually persistent meeting, that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould wish them all\r\ndaughters and wives like her.\xe2\x80\x9d The most that he could be persuaded to\r\ngrant was that at the end of five years she should be allowed to exchange\r\nher island (Pandateria) for Rhegium, and to live under less stringent\r\nconditions as to dress and food, and the servants who attended her. Her\r\nmother, Scribonia, accompanied her into exile, and though Tiberius,\r\nacting under the authority of Augustus, sent from Rhodes a message of\r\ndivorce, he made a formal request that she might be allowed to retain\r\nwhatever he had given her. The sincerity of such an intercession was\r\nillustrated by the fact that on the death of Augustus he immediately\r\ndeprived her of all allowances. She, however, only survived her father a\r\nfew weeks. All this severity is perhaps best accounted for if we accept\r\nthe statement of Dio and Pliny, that she was charged not only with\r\nadultery, but with joining in some plot against her father in favour\r\nof her lover, Iulius Antonius.[310] At any rate it is difficult not to\r\nfeel some sympathy with a woman, married and re-married without choice\r\non her part or any question of affection, for nine years the wife of a\r\nman as old as her father, and then transferred to another, whose heart\r\nwas fixed elsewhere, and whom his warmest admirers cannot describe as\r\none likely to be sympathetic or expansive, one in fact who began with a\r\nstrong prejudice against her. She knew also that her own mother, with\r\nwhom she seems to have kept up affectionate relations, had been turned\r\noff immediately after her birth for no assignable reason, just as she had\r\nbeen married for a momentary political object. She could have grown up\r\nwith no very deep reverence for her father\xe2\x80\x99s morality or lofty ideas of\r\nthe marriage relationship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Gaius and Lucius C\xc3\xa6sar, A.D. 2-4.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward family misfortunes seemed to dog the steps of\r\nAugustus for some years to come. The next blow was the death of the\r\ntwo young sons of Iulia, Gaius and Lucius, whom he had adopted, had\r\npersonally educated in their childhood, and was training for their great\r\nfuture. When the elder was only 15 (B.C. 5) he had been designated consul\r\nfor A.D. 1, and the Senate had voted that he and his brother might at\r\nthat age \xe2\x80\x9ctake part in public business,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, might be employed in\r\nany capacity the Emperor might choose directly they assumed the _toga\r\nvirilis_. Accordingly, in B.C. 1, Gaius was sent to the East, with a\r\npretty wide commission to visit the Eastern provinces. He seems to have\r\ntravelled considerable distances, and even entered Arabia. Tiberius,\r\nwho was then at Rhodes, crossed to Samos to greet him. The meeting,\r\nhowever, was not a happy one. M. Lollius, the head of Gaius\xe2\x80\x99s staff,\r\nseems to have influenced the young prince against Tiberius, and induced\r\nhim to send home a report to the Emperor of certain indications that he\r\nwas contemplating some treasonable measures. Augustus candidly informed\r\nTiberius of this, and it was it seems partly from the necessity of\r\nclearing himself, that at the earnest entreaty of his mother, he, two\r\nyears later, sought and obtained the permission of Augustus to return\r\nto Rome. Meanwhile there had been wild talk among the staff of Gaius,\r\none of them expressing his readiness to sail to Rhodes and bring the\r\nhead of \xe2\x80\x9cthe exile\xe2\x80\x9d back. He does not, however, appear to have forfeited\r\nthe confidence or affection of Augustus, who writes to him on the 23rd\r\nSeptember, A.D. 1: \xe2\x80\x9cGood day to you, Gaius, apple of my eye, whom by\r\nheaven I continually miss when away. But it is especially on days such\r\nas this one that my eyes seek for my Gaius; and wherever you have spent\r\nit I hope that you have kept my sixty-fourth birthday in good health\r\nand spirits. For you see I have safely passed the grand climacteric,\r\nwhich for all old men is their 63rd year. Pray heaven that whatever\r\ntime remains for me I may spend with the knowledge that you and your\r\nbrother are safe and sound and the republic supremely prosperous, with\r\nyou playing the man and preparing to take up my work.\xe2\x80\x9d But these hopes\r\nwere doomed to be disappointed, as we have seen, by the treacherous\r\nwound received at Artagera in Armenia in A.D. 4. Two years earlier his\r\nyounger brother, Lucius, had died suddenly and somewhat mysteriously at\r\nMarseilles at the beginning of a progress through the Western provinces,\r\nwhich was to form part of his political education. The fact that his\r\ndeath corresponded nearly with the return of Tiberius from Rhodes gave\r\nrise to suspicions that it had been caused by the machinations of Livia,\r\nanxious to secure the succession for her son. Even the death of Gaius,\r\nthough so far away, was put down to the same malignant influence; for\r\nit was argued that his wound was slight and had not been expected to\r\nend fatally. Tacitus records that the detractors of the imperial family\r\nwere accustomed to remark that \xe2\x80\x9cLivia had been a fatal mother to the\r\nrepublic, a fatal stepdame to the family of the C\xc3\xa6sars.\xe2\x80\x9d There is,\r\nhowever, no scrap of evidence to connect her with either event. It is\r\ndoubtful whether the young men had shewn much promise; but their death\r\nwas treated as a matter for public mourning. At Pis\xc3\xa6, of which colony\r\nthey were \xe2\x80\x9cpatrons,\xe2\x80\x9d there still exist two long and pompous inscriptions\r\n(_Cenotaphia_) recording their death, speaking of the successful campaign\r\nof Gaius in the East, ordering mourning \xe2\x80\x9cin view of the magnitude of so\r\ngreat and unexpected a calamity,\xe2\x80\x9d and decreeing various honours to the\r\nmemory of Lucius \xe2\x80\x9cprinceps iuventutis,\xe2\x80\x9d and of Gaius \xe2\x80\x9cprinceps designate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The succession.]\r\n\r\nThese losses were followed by the adoption of Tiberius by Augustus, and\r\nthat of Germanicus by Tiberius. The former had already several children,\r\nso that the sons and grandsons and great-grandsons\xe2\x80\x94by adoption\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nAugustus in A.D. 7, as recorded on the arch at Pavia, were Tiberius;\r\nGermanicus; Drusus, son of Tiberius; Nero and Drusus, sons of Germanicus,\r\nand Claudius, his brother. All these survived Augustus. But Tiberius and\r\nClaudius alone reigned, Caligula was not born till five years later (A.D.\r\n12).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fresh troubles. The younger Iulia.]\r\n\r\nAugustus thus felt that the succession was well secured; but the last\r\ndecade of his life was destined in some ways to be the most troubled of\r\nall. The German wars began again in A.D. 4, and culminated in the Varian\r\ndisaster of A.D. 9; while the difficulties and alarm were increased by\r\nthe dangerous risings in Pannonia and Dalmatia (A.D. 6-9), during which\r\nAugustus remained for some time at Ariminum, to be within moderate\r\ndistance of the seat of war. A renewed outbreak of piracy also compelled\r\nhim to take over the management of Sardinia from the Senate for three\r\nyears (A.D. 6-9). This was partly the cause, perhaps, of the distress at\r\nRome in B.C. 6 from a rise in the price of corn, intensified by various\r\ndisastrous fires. The unrest thus created led to some more or less\r\ndangerous conspiracies, such as that of Plautius Rufus, who was accused\r\nof abetting disturbances and spreading seditious libels. Others were\r\nconnected with attempts to rescue Iulia at Rhegium and Agrippa Postumus\r\nin Planasia, an island near Elba. We also hear of a plot of one Cornelius\r\nCinna, who however was pardoned and allowed to be consul in A.D. 4.\r\nSeneca asserts that after this act of clemency the life of Augustus was\r\nnever attempted again; and Dio has recorded a conversation between him\r\nand Livia in that year, in which, seeing her husband sleepless and torn\r\nwith continued anxieties, she recommended this policy of leniency. But\r\none last mortification remained for him. In A.D. 9 his granddaughter\r\nIulia was discovered to have followed her mother\xe2\x80\x99s example. She was\r\nmarried to \xc3\x86milius Paulus Lepidus, and had a son and a daughter Lepida,\r\nonce betrothed to the future Emperor Claudius, but never married to him.\r\nHer lover, D. Silanus, was not banished to any definite place, but was\r\nobliged to leave Rome, to which he was not allowed to return till A.D.\r\n20, and then under disabilities for State employment. Iulia herself\r\nwas banished to the island Tremesus (_St. Domenico_), on the coast of\r\nApulia, where she remained till her death in A.D. 27, supported by an\r\nallowance from Livia. We do not know enough of the affair to judge of\r\nher guilt; but in some mysterious way her husband was involved in a\r\ncharge of treason about this time. In the same year the poet Ovid was\r\nbanished to Tomi, forty miles south of the mouth of the Danube, in a\r\ndistrict exposed to constant raids of the Sarmatians and Dacians. It has\r\nalways been supposed that this severity was connected with the affair of\r\nIulia, and that either he was one of her lovers, or was privy to some of\r\nher intrigues, amatory or political. The reason assigned in the edict\r\nappears to have been the licentiousness of his verse, and as Augustus\r\nwas just then engaged in reinforcing his laws against various forms of\r\nimmorality, and trying to encourage marriage as against concubinage,\r\nthis may have been partly the reason. Only as his most licentious poems\r\nhad been published seven years before it seems a little late in the\r\nday. His own account of his misfortune\xe2\x80\x94never outspoken\xe2\x80\x94goes through two\r\nphases. At first he seems to wish to attribute it all to his amatory\r\npoems. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a poet destroyed by his own genius: his verses have been\r\nhis undoing: they deserved punishment, but sure not so heavy a one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut presently he began to own that there was something else: \xe2\x80\x9cNot,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cany political offence, no plot against the Emperor, no plan of\r\nviolence against the state. He had seen something he should not have\r\nseen. He is ruined by his own simplicity and want of prudence, combined\r\nwith treachery on the part of friends and slaves. The exact cause he dare\r\nnot reveal, and yet it is well known at Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d Ovid was now fifty-two and\r\nmarried for a third time to a wife connected distantly with the imperial\r\nfamily. The chances are therefore against an intrigue with Iulia. There\r\nis one other possible explanation; Ovid was at Elba when he got notice of\r\nthe edict, staying with his wife\xe2\x80\x99s connection, Paulus Fabius Maximus, who\r\nafterwards incurred the suspicion of Livia as favouring Agrippa Postumus,\r\nconfined in the neighbouring island of Planasia since B.C. 7. We know\r\nfrom Suetonius that there was at least one plot to remove him, and it may\r\nbe that Ovid knew of it and even saw some of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the other explanation is also possible: that\r\nAugustus meant what he said, and regarded Ovid\xe2\x80\x99s works as unwholesome.\r\nHe was what would be called in our time a \xe2\x80\x9cdecadent\xe2\x80\x9d poet. He represents\r\nthe worst side of Roman society, as it began to be unfavourably affected\r\nby that abstention from practical politics, which came to be the fashion\r\nin the latter half of the reign of Augustus. He had himself refused to\r\ntake any office that would give him a seat in the Senate, and seemed to\r\nthink that to be the natural conduct of a man of taste and literature. He\r\nwas the mouthpiece of the gilded youth who sought in amorous intrigue,\r\nand a fastidious dalliance with the Muses, a more congenial employment\r\nthan the performance of those duties to the state which no longer held\r\nout promises of unlimited wealth or power. He was only cleverer than the\r\nruck of such men, and Augustus may possibly have selected him as the\r\nrepresentative of a tendency at which he was alarmed. Ovid was precisely\r\nthe sort of man to create the tone of society which had been the ruin of\r\nhis daughter and granddaughter. It is quite possible that being intimate\r\nwith such circles the poet may have known, or been supposed to know,\r\nsomething inconvenient about the last scandal, and, at any rate, he would\r\nbe on the side of Iulia as against her grandfather. At the time of his\r\nexile he was engaged, at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion or request, on the\r\ncomposition of the poetical Calendar or Fasti, which was incidentally to\r\ncelebrate the chief events of Roman history, and it has been suggested\r\nthat the story of Claudia\xe2\x80\x99s vindication of her chastity (_Fast._ iv. 305\r\n_sqq._) was intended as a veiled defence of the elder or younger Iulia.\r\nWhatever the offence given, neither Augustus nor Tiberius could ever be\r\ninduced to allow his recall.\r\n\r\nThe poet\xe2\x80\x99s abject language in praying to be allowed to return illustrates\r\nincidentally the absolute supremacy of the Emperor, and the attribution\r\nto him of divine honours and powers, the steady progress of which has\r\nbeen noted in a previous chapter. We may also note that what Paris is to\r\nthe Parisians, Rome is to Ovid. Augustus and his ministers or friends had\r\nmade it the home of splendour and luxury. The poet fondly dwells on all\r\nits beauties, pleasures, and conveniences, and, like a true Parisian,\r\ncan hardly conceive of life away from it, its games, its theatres, the\r\nsports on the Campus, the lounge in the forum, or the wit and poetry\r\nheard at the tables of the great. As the spring comes round in his\r\ndreary, treeless dwelling on the Pontus, he thinks of the flowers and\r\nvines of Italy, but, above all, of the pleasures of the city in April,\r\nthe month of festivals: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is holiday with you now, and the wordy war of\r\nthe wrangling forum is giving place to the unbroken round of festivals.\r\nThe horses are in request, and the light foils are in play. The young\r\nathletes, their shoulders glistening with oil, are bathing wearied limbs\r\nin baths supplied by the virgin stream. The stage is in full swing, and\r\nthe audiences are clapping their favourite actors, and the three theatres\r\nare echoing instead of the three forums. Oh four times, oh beyond all\r\ncounting, happy he who may enjoy the city unforbidden!\xe2\x80\x9d It had been the\r\nobject of Augustus to make the city splendid and attractive, and to\r\nkeep the citizens comfortable and contented and proud of their home. He\r\nhad doubtless succeeded; but it was sometimes at the cost of a lowered\r\nstandard of public duty and a growing devotion to personal ease and\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS\r\n\r\n    _Let the sound of those he fought for,_\r\n    _And the feet of those he wrought for,_\r\n    _Echo round his bones for evermore._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The activities of the last years of Augustus, A.D. 8-14.]\r\n\r\nThe public and private troubles mentioned in the last chapter did not\r\nbreak the spirit or paralyse the energies of the aged Emperor, or prevent\r\nhim from taking a strenuous part in the administration of the Empire.\r\nThe last eight years of his life were full of stir and movement, though\r\nour meagre authorities give us few details. He actively supported the\r\ncampaigns of Tiberius and Germanicus; he was introducing reforms in\r\nGaul;[311] he was pushing on improvements in the East, and founding a\r\nseries of colonies in Pisidia as a defence against the predatory mountain\r\ntribes; he was directing a census of the whole Empire; he was emending\r\nhis marriage laws by the farther enactments contained in the _lex Papia\r\nPopp\xc3\xa6a_, which he supported by energetic speeches; he was elaborating a\r\ngreat financial scheme; he was personally attending to the embankment of\r\nthe Tiber; he was reforming the city police and fire brigades; and when\r\nthe Varian disaster occurred we have seen with what energy he acted, how\r\nhe enforced the law of military service and despatched reinforcements to\r\nthe Rhine, while he cleared the city of dangerous elements and provided\r\nagainst possible movements in the provinces. Though now seventy-two\r\nyears old he shewed no sign of senility in heart; and as it was said\r\nthat at every stage of his life he had the beauty appropriate to it, so\r\nin spirit, courage, and prudence he seems always to have answered to any\r\nstrain to which he was submitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial measures of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nTo understand the financial changes of these years it is necessary to\r\nrecall a few broad facts as to the revenue of the Empire. It arose from\r\n(1) Italy, (2) the provinces. In Italy the sources of revenue were the\r\ncustoms (_portoria_), the rent of public land, the _vicesima_ or 5 per\r\ncent. on the value of manumitted slaves. From the time that it became\r\nthe habit to pay the soldiers, a _tributum_ or property tax had been\r\nraised, at first as a temporary measure, or even as a loan, but gradually\r\nas a regular thing. Since the Macedonian wars, however, B.C. 167, this\r\n_tributum_ had not been levied: the additional wealth acquired by the new\r\nconquests being sufficient. It does not appear that the _tributum_ was\r\nabolished by law, and indeed for a short time it was reimposed by the\r\nTriumvirs, though only as an extraordinary tax (_temerarium_). After the\r\nSocial war of B.C. 89 the Italians became full citizens and shared this\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\nThe second and most important source of revenue were the provinces.\r\nThere were royalties on mines, customs, rent of public land, and other\r\nsources of profit to the government; but also every province paid a\r\n_stipendium_\xe2\x80\x94a certain sum of money\xe2\x80\x94to the Roman treasury. The manner\r\nin which it was paid\xe2\x80\x94whether in money or produce, or a mixture of\r\nthe two\xe2\x80\x94differed in different provinces, as also did the mode of its\r\nassessment and collection; but the broad fact was that each province had\r\nto furnish a sum of money, and that owners of property in a province\r\nwere liable to a _tributum_ or tax.[312]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Augustus there was no great change made in the nature or\r\nincidence of this taxation; but the management of the treasury itself was\r\nrevolutionised. In the first place, the _\xc3\xa6rarium_ instead of being under\r\nthe care of the yearly elected qu\xc3\xa6stors, who issued money on the order of\r\nSenate or magistrates, was put under _pr\xc3\xa6fecti_ appointed by the Emperor,\r\nand though the Senate still had a nominal control over it, it was\r\nreally under his power. In the next place, a new _\xc3\xa6rarium_ was formed,\r\nafterwards called the _fiscus_, into which was paid the revenues of the\r\nimperial provinces. This was entirely under the Emperor, and the tendency\r\nwas in time to have every extraordinary revenue, such as confiscations,\r\nlapsed legacies (_caduca_), and the like, paid into it. Besides this\r\nthere was the _patrimonium C\xc3\xa6sarum_, the private property of the Emperor\r\nin virtue of his office. To this belonged the whole revenues of Egypt and\r\nthe Thracian Chersonese, and other large estates. When Augustus talks of\r\nhis having supplemented the treasury or made distributions to the people,\r\nit is often from this fund that he drew, though he had besides large\r\npersonal property (_res familiaris_), which he employed at times for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nOf course from the revenue of the provinces had to be deducted the cost\r\nof their administration and defence. Provinces, therefore, which needed\r\nlarge forces and constant defence from surrounding barbarians did not\r\npay. Cicero, indeed, asserts that in his time none of the provinces\r\nexcept Asia paid for their expenses. This probably is an exaggeration,\r\nbut there is no doubt that the loss on some had to be put against the\r\ngain on others, and that the balance of the yearly budget was not always\r\non the right side, as, at a later date, we know that Vespasian said that\r\nthe treasury wanted four hundred million sesterces (about \xc2\xa33,000,000\r\nsterling) to be solvent. The outbreak of the German wars in A.D. 4, and\r\nthe large forces which it had long been necessary to keep upon the Rhine\r\nhad caused, if not a deficit, at any rate the near prospect of one. It\r\nwas just such a crisis as in old times would have justified the levying\r\nof a _tributum_ as a special war tax. There were, however, two reasons\r\nagainst Augustus doing this. In the first place, such a _tributum_ would\r\nbe temporary, and he wanted a permanency; and, in the second place, the\r\ncitizens had come to view freedom from the _tributum_ as their special\r\nprivilege, differentiating Italy from the subject provinces, and marking\r\nthem out as a governing body. True to his policy of avoiding offensive\r\nnames, while at the same time getting what he wanted, Augustus decided\r\nagainst the _tributum_. What he did was to create a new department, an\r\narmy-pay treasury (_aes militare_), with two pr\xc3\xa6fects of pr\xc3\xa6torian rank.\r\nThe money in this treasury was to be devoted to the pay and pensions\r\nof the soldiers. He started it with a gift in his own name and that of\r\nTiberius of 170,000,000 sesterces (about \xc2\xa31,500,000), and arranged that\r\nthe tax which he had contrived soon after the end of the civil wars, the\r\n1 per cent. on goods sold at auctions or by contract, should be paid\r\ninto it. But this was not sufficient for the purpose, and he had to\r\nlook round for other means of raising revenue. He did therefore what a\r\nlate Chancellor of the Exchequer did for us\xe2\x80\x94he imposed death duties: 5\r\nper cent. on all legacies except those from the nearest relatives. This\r\navoided the offensiveness of depriving the people of Italy of a valued\r\nprivilege, while it in fact brought them financially almost in a line\r\nwith the provinces. For those who paid _tributum_ did not pay _vicesima_,\r\nand _vice vers\xc3\xa2_. Still the tax offended a powerful class and met with\r\nmuch resistance. The practice of leaving large legacies to friends, as\r\nan acknowledgment of services rendered, was common in Italy, and the tax\r\ntherefore fell heavily upon the rich. In A.D. 13 a determined move was\r\nmade in the Senate to obtain its abolition. Augustus sent a written\r\ncommunication to the Senate, pointing out that the money was necessary,\r\nbut asking them to contrive some other method of raising it. The Senators\r\ndeclined to formulate any plan, and only answered that they were ready\r\nto submit to _anything_ else. Thereupon Augustus proposed a _tributum_\r\nor tax on land and houses. Confronted with this alternative the Senate\r\nat once withdrew from opposition. It was a case of financial necessity,\r\nand it must not be supposed that Augustus wished to lower the prestige\r\nof Italy or the value of the citizenship. That was one of the points in\r\nwhich he reversed the policy of Iulius, who had been lavish in bestowing\r\nthe citizenship, and seems to have had visions of a uniform Empire united\r\nin privilege as in government. Augustus, on the other hand, was even\r\nultra-conservative and ultra-Roman in this respect. He made constant\r\ndifficulties about granting the citizenship. In answer to Tiberius, who\r\nbegged it for some favourite Greek, he insisted upon only granting it if\r\nthe man appeared personally and convinced him of the soundness of his\r\nclaim. Even Livia met with a refusal in behalf of some Gaul. The Emperor\r\noffered to grant the man immunity from tribute, saying that he cared less\r\nabout a loss to his treasury than for vulgarising the citizenship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declining health and strength.]\r\n\r\nThough Augustus shewed in this transaction all his old tact and\r\nstatesmanship with no failure either in determination or power of\r\n_finesse_, yet he was growing visibly feebler in body. He gave up\r\nattending social functions; and it was too much for him to appear any\r\nlonger at meetings of the Senate. Accordingly, instead of the half-yearly\r\ncommittee of twenty-five members who used to be appointed to prepare\r\nmeasures for the House, a sort of inner cabinet of twenty members\r\nappointed for a year\xe2\x80\x94with any members of his family whom he chose\xe2\x80\x94met\r\nat his house and often round the couch on which he was reclining, and\r\ntheir decisions were given the force of a _Senatus-consultum_. His\r\ninterest, however, in every detail was as keen as ever. For instance,\r\nwe have a letter from him to Livia, written at the end of A.D. 11,\r\nas to the advisability of allowing Claudius (the future Emperor) to\r\nappear in Rome during the ceremonies connected with the consulship of\r\nhis brother Germanicus. Claudius (now twenty-one) was reported to be\r\ndeformed and half-witted, and his mother Antonia herself described him as\r\nscarcely human (_monstrum hominis_). The letter is worth reading, partly\r\nbecause it is the only complete one (at any rate, of any length) which\r\nwe possess, and partly because it illustrates the care which Augustus\r\ntook to keep up the prestige of the imperial family, to avoid, above all\r\nthings, incurring popular ridicule, and his attention to minute details:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have consulted with Tiberius, as you desired me to do, my dear Livia,\r\nas to what is to be done about your grandson (Claudius) Tiberius. We\r\nentirely agree in thinking that we must settle once for all what line we\r\nare to take in regard to him. For if he is sound and, to use a common\r\nexpression, has all his wits about him, what possible reason can there\r\nbe for our doubting that he ought to be promoted through the same grades\r\nand steps as his brother? But if we find that he is deficient, and so\r\nderanged in mind and body as to be unfit for society, we must not give\r\npeople accustomed to scoff and sneer at such things a handle for casting\r\nridicule both on him and on us. The fact is that we shall always be in\r\na state of agitation if we stop to consider every detail as it occurs,\r\nwithout having made up our minds whether to think him capable of holding\r\noffices or not. On the present occasion, however, in regard to the point\r\non which you consult me, I do not object to his having charge of the\r\ntriclinium of the priests at the games of Mars if he will submit to\r\nreceive instructions from his relative, the son of Silanus, to prevent\r\nhis doing anything to make people stare or laugh. We agree that he is not\r\nto be in the imperial box at the Circus. For he will be in full view of\r\neverybody and be conspicuous. We agree that he is not to go to the Alban\r\nMount or to be in Rome on the days of the Latin festival. For if he is\r\ngood enough to be in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s train to the mountain, why should\r\nhe not be honorary city prefect? Those are the decisions at which we\r\narrived, my dear Livia, and we wish them to be settled once for all to\r\nprevent our wavering between hope and fear. You are at liberty, if you\r\nchoose, to give Antonia this part of my letter to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confidence in Tiberius.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the voice is the voice of Tiberius, but the courtesy and\r\nwell-bred style are all Augustus\xe2\x80\x99s. By this time the influence of\r\nTiberius was well established, and Augustus treats him as a successor who\r\nhas a right to be consulted on all family matters and important State\r\naffairs. Since his return from Rhodes Tiberius had done eminent service\r\nto the State both on the Rhine and in Illyricum. In appointing Varus\r\nto Germany Augustus had made a mistake which he seldom committed. He\r\nhad nearly always picked good men, but P. Quintilius Varus had not only\r\nbeen extortionate in his former province, but was neither energetic nor\r\nprudent; and his experience among the unwarlike inhabitants of Syria was\r\nnot a good preparation for dealing with the brave and warlike Germans.\r\nTiberius knew him well, having been his colleague in the consulship of\r\nB.C. 13, and would certainly not have appointed him. It was to Tiberius\r\nthat the Emperor then turned to retrieve the disaster and confront the\r\nalmost more serious dangers in Illyricum. And if he found him trustworthy\r\nin the field, this letter shows how much confidence he felt in him\r\nat home. It was a common report that Augustus knew and disliked his\r\ncharacter. The lackeys of the palace gave out that he had on one occasion\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy people of Rome who will some day be the victims of\r\nthose slow grinders!\xe2\x80\x9d And in a speech to the Senate some expressions\r\nused by him were taken to convey an apology for his reserved and sullen\r\nmanners, and an acknowledgment, therefore, of his mistrust or dislike.\r\nBut it is abundantly plain that in these last years he not only trusted\r\nhis military abilities, but felt a sincere affection for himself. In\r\nearlier times, before the retreat to Rhodes, the short notes written\r\nto him (parts of which are preserved by Suetonius[313]) are playful\r\nand intimate; and though he was vexed at his retirement and answered a\r\nsuggestion of return by a message bidding him \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss all concern for\r\nhis relatives, whom he had abandoned with such excessive eagerness,\xe2\x80\x9d[314]\r\nyet the fragments preserved of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s letters to him in these\r\nlater times breathe not only admiration, but warm affection. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye,\r\nTiberius, most delightful of men! Success to you in the field, you who\r\nserve the Muses as well as me! Most delightful of men, and, as I hope\r\nto be happy, bravest of heroes and steadiest of generals!\xe2\x80\x9d And again:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow splendidly managed are your summer quarters! I am decidedly of\r\nopinion that, in the face of so many untoward circumstances and such\r\ndemoralisation of the troops, no one could have borne himself with\r\ngreater prudence than you are doing! The officers now at Rome who have\r\nserved with you all confess that the verse might have been written for\r\nyou, \xe2\x80\x98One man by vigilance restored the State.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Once more: \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever\r\nanything occurs that calls for more than usually earnest thought or that\r\nstirs my spleen, what I miss most, by heaven, is my dear Tiberius, and\r\nthat passage of Homer always occurs to me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If he but follow, e\xe2\x80\x99en from burning fire\r\n    We both shall back return, so wise is he!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of his laborious campaign the Emperor writes to him\r\nanxiously: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I hear or read that you are worn out by the protracted\r\nnature of your labours, heaven confound me if I do not shudder in every\r\nlimb; and I beseech you to spare yourself, lest if we hear of your being\r\nill your mother and I should expire and the Roman people run the risk of\r\nlosing their empire. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter a bit whether I am well or not as\r\nlong as you are not well. I pray the gods to preserve you to us and to\r\nsuffer you to be well now and always, unless they abhor the Roman people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese letters seem sufficiently to refute the idle stories of the _g\xc3\xaane_\r\nthat his presence was to Augustus, of his being a wet blanket to cheerful\r\nconversation, and a makeshift with which the Emperor was forced to put\r\nup in default of better heirs. Nor did Tiberius fall short in respect\r\nand loyal service. After his adoption in A.D. 4, he immediately accepted\r\nthe position of a son under the _patria potestas_, abstained from\r\nmanumissions and other acts of a man who was _sui iuris_, and apparently\r\ntransferred his residence to the palace, and seems really to have taken\r\nthe burden from shoulders no longer strong enough to bear it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Augustus at Nola, August 19, A.D. 14.]\r\n\r\nFor now the end was near, portended as the pious or credulous believed\r\nby many omens. There was an eclipse of the sun,[315] and various fiery\r\nmeteors in the sky. On one of his statues the letter C of C\xc3\xa6sar was\r\nmelted by lightning, and the augurs prophesied, or afterwards invented\r\nthe prediction, that he would die within a hundred days and join the\r\ngods\xe2\x80\x94_\xc3\xa6sar_ being good Etruscan for \xe2\x80\x9cdivinities.\xe2\x80\x9d He himself seems to\r\nhave been made somewhat nervous by certain accidents that might be\r\ntwisted into omens. The early part of A.D. 14 was taken up with the\r\nusual legal business, but also with the Census, which he held this year\r\nin virtue of his consular power and with Tiberius as his colleague. The\r\norganisation of the city into _vici_ probably made the actual clerical\r\nwork easy and rapid, but when that was over came the ceremony of \xe2\x80\x9cclosing\r\nthe lustrum\xe2\x80\x9d (_condere lustrum_), and the offering of solemn sacrifice\r\nand prayer. This took place in the Campus Martius, and large crowds\r\nassembled to witness it. But the Emperor, uneasy at something which\r\nhe thought ominous, or perhaps really feeling unwell, would not read\r\nthe solemn vows, which according to custom had been written out and\r\nwere now put into his hands. He said that he should not live to fulfil\r\nthem and handed them over to Tiberius to read. After this ceremony was\r\nover, Augustus was anxious to get away from Rome and take his usual\r\nyachting tour along the Latin and Campanian coast. On this occasion he\r\nhad the farther object of accompanying Tiberius as far as Beneventum\r\non the Appian road, on his way to Brundisium and Illyricum, where some\r\ndifficulties resulting from the recent war required his presence and\r\nauthority. But various legal causes awaiting decision detained the\r\nEmperor in the city. He was restive and impatient at the delay, and\r\npetulantly exclaimed that \xe2\x80\x9cif they let everything stop them he should\r\nnever be at Rome again.\xe2\x80\x9d At length, however, he set out, accompanied\r\nby Livia and Tiberius and a numerous court. They reached the coast at\r\nAstura, in the delta of a river of the same name, which falls into the\r\nsea at the southern point of the bay of Antium. It was a quiet place\r\nthough there were seaside villas near, and there Cicero had spent the\r\nmonths of his mourning for Tullia, finding consolation in the solitude\r\nof the woods which skirt the side of the stream. At Astura the party\r\nembarked, but owing to the state of the wind they did so by night. A\r\nchill then caught brought on diarrh\xc5\x93a, and laid the foundation of his\r\nfatal illness. Nevertheless the voyage along the Campanian coast and the\r\nadjacent islands was continued till they reached Capre\xc3\xa6. It was on this\r\nvoyage that, happening to touch at Puteoli, he was so much delighted and\r\ncheered by the thanks offered him by the crew of an Alexandrian corn-ship\r\nfor his safeguarding of the seas. At Capre\xc3\xa6 he seems to have stayed some\r\ntime, amusing himself by watching the young athletes training for the\r\nGreek games at Naples\xe2\x80\x94the only town in Italy except Rhegium which at this\r\ntime retained any traces of Hellenic customs and life. He gave parties,\r\nalso, at which he asked his Roman guests to dress in Greek fashion and\r\nspeak Greek, and the Greeks to use Roman dress and speak Latin. There\r\nwas the usual distribution of presents, and on one occasion he gave\r\na banquet to the athletes in training, and watched them after dinner\r\npelting each other with apples and other parts of the dessert. It was a\r\ncustom, more honoured in the breach than in the observance, with which he\r\nwas familiar. He once entertained a certain Curtius, who prided himself\r\non his taste in cookery, and who thought a fat thrush that had been put\r\nbefore him was ill-done. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I despatch it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the Emperor. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; upon which he threw it out of the window. On this\r\noccasion the aged Emperor, feeling, we may suppose, somewhat better and\r\nglad to be away from the cares of State, enjoyed this curious horse-play.\r\nHe was also particularly cheerful during these days at Capre\xc3\xa6, pleasing\r\nhimself with inventing Greek verses and then defying one of Tiberius\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfavourite astrologers to name the play from which they came.\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, he crossed to Naples, with his illness still upon\r\nhim, but with alternate rallies and relapses. At Naples he had to sit\r\nthrough some long gymnastic contests that were held every fifth year\r\nin his honour. Such a function in an August day at Naples would have\r\nbeen trying to the most vigorous and healthy, but for a man in his\r\nseventy-sixth year, and suffering from such a complaint, it must have\r\nbeen deadly. He preferred, however, not to disappoint people eager to\r\nshew him honour. He then fulfilled his purpose of accompanying Tiberius\r\nto Beneventum, and having taken leave of him there turned back towards\r\nNaples. But he was never to reach it. At Nola, about eighteen English\r\nmiles short of that town, his illness became so acute that he was obliged\r\nto stop at the villa there in which his father had died seventy-two\r\nyears before. Messengers were hastily sent to recall Tiberius. With\r\nhim the dying man had a long private conversation, in which he seems\r\nto have imparted to him his wishes and counsels as to the government;\r\nand perhaps it was now that he pointed out the three nobles who were\r\npossible candidates for the succession\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMarcus Lepidus, who was fit for\r\nit, but would not care to take it; Asinius Gallus, who would desire it,\r\nbut was unfit; and L. Arruntius, who was not unfit for it and would have\r\nthe courage to seize it if opportunity offered.\xe2\x80\x9d But this conference over\r\nhe busied himself with no other affairs of State. He seemed to acquiesce\r\nin the fact that he had done with the world, its vexations and problems.\r\nOn the last day of his life, the 19th of August (his lucky month!) the\r\nonly question which he continually repeated was whether his situation\r\nwas causing any commotion out of doors. Then he asked for a mirror\r\nand directed his attendants to arrange his hair and close his already\r\nrelaxing jaws, that he might not shock beholders by the ghastliness of\r\nhis appearance. Then his friends were admitted to say goodbye. With a\r\npathetic mixture of playfulness and sadness he asked them whether \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nthought that he had played life\xe2\x80\x99s farce fairly well?\xe2\x80\x9d quoting a common\r\ntag at the end of plays:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf aught of good our sport had, clap your hands,\r\n    And send us, gentles all, with joy away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese being dismissed, he turned to Livia and asked for news of one of\r\nher granddaughters who was ill; but even as he spoke he felt the end was\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLivia, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget our wedded life, goodbye!\xe2\x80\x9d And as he tried to\r\nkiss her lips he fell back dead.\r\n\r\nIt was a rapid and painless end, for which he had so often hoped, an\r\n_euthanasia_ that he used to pray for, for himself and his friends. Up\r\nto the last his mind had been clear, with only the slightest occasional\r\nwandering. And so after long years of work and struggle, of mixed evil\r\nand good, of stern cruelties and beneficent exertion, of desperate\r\ndangers and well-earned honours, the great Emperor as he lay dying looked\r\ninto the eyes which he had loved best in the world.\r\n\r\nThe body was borne to Rome by the municipal magistrates of the several\r\ntowns along the road, the _cort\xc3\xa8ge_ always moving by night because of the\r\nheat, and the bier being deposited in the court-house of each town till\r\nit reached Bovill\xc3\xa6, twelve miles from Rome. There a procession of Roman\r\nknights took it in charge, having obtained that honour from the consuls,\r\nconducted it to Rome, and deposited it in the vestibule of his own house\r\non the Palatine.\r\n\r\nWith not unnatural or unpardonable emotion some extravagant proposals\r\nwere made in the Senate as to funeral honours and general mourning. But\r\nTiberius disliked such excesses, and the funeral though stately was\r\nsimple. The bier was carried on the shoulders of Senators to the Campus.\r\nTwice the _cort\xc3\xa8ge_ stopped, first at the Rostra, where Drusus, the son\r\nof Tiberius, delivered a funeral oration (_laudatio_), and again at the\r\nfront of the temple of Iulius, where Tiberius himself read a panegyric.\r\nDrusus had dwelt chiefly on his private virtues, Tiberius confined\r\nhimself to his public work. He began with a reference to his youthful\r\nservices to the state immediately after the death of C\xc3\xa6sar; his success\r\nin putting an end to the civil wars, and his clemency after them. He\r\nspoke of the skill with which, while splendidly rewarding his ministers,\r\nhe yet prevented them from gaining a power detrimental to the state; of\r\nhis disinterested and constitutional conduct when, having everything in\r\nhis hands, he yet shared the power with the people and Senate; of his\r\nunselfishness in the division of the provinces in taking the difficult\r\nones upon himself; of his equity in leaving Senate and constitution\r\nindependent; of his economy and liberality; of the good order which\r\nhe kept and the wholesome laws which he carried; of his sympathy with\r\nthe tastes and enjoyments of the people; of his hatred of flattery and\r\ntolerance of free speech. The address was read and had been carefully\r\ncomposed. There is not much fervour or eloquence in it, but it skilfully\r\nput the points which Augustus would himself have put, and indeed had put\r\nin that _apologia pro vita sua_ which we know from the inscription at\r\nAncyra.\r\n\r\nThe speeches over, the _cort\xc3\xa8ge_ moved on to the Campus Martius,\r\nwhere the body was burnt on the pyre prepared for it, and the ashes\r\nceremoniously collected by eminent equites, who according to custom wore\r\nonly their tunics, without the toga, ungirdled, and with bare feet.\r\nThe urn was then deposited in the Mausoleum which Augustus had himself\r\nerected in B.C. 28 on the Campus close to the curving river-bank, which\r\nhad already received the ashes of his nephew Marcellus, of his sister\r\nOctavia, of his two grandsons, and of his great friend and minister\r\nAgrippa, but was sternly closed by his will to his erring daughter and\r\ngranddaughter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His will, and other documents left by him.]\r\n\r\nAlways careful and businesslike, he left his testamentary dispositions\r\nand the accounts of his administration in perfect order. His will,\r\nwhich had been deposited with the Vestal Virgins and was now read aloud\r\nby Drusus in the Senate, made Tiberius heir to two-thirds, Livia to\r\none-third of his private property. In case of their predeceasing him it\r\nwas to be divided between Drusus (son of Tiberius), Germanicus, and his\r\nthree sons, as \xe2\x80\x9csecond heirs.\xe2\x80\x9d There were liberal legacies to citizens\r\nand soldiers and to various friends. The property thus disposed of was\r\nthe _res familiaris_: the _Patrimonium C\xc3\xa6sarum_\xe2\x80\x94Egypt, the Thracian\r\nChersonese, and other estates\xe2\x80\x94went to his successor in the principate.\r\nThe will contained an apology for the smallness of the amount thus coming\r\nto his heirs (150,000,000 sesterces or about \xc2\xa31,200,000) on the plea that\r\nhe had devoted to the public service nearly all the vast legacies which\r\nhad fallen to him. By the will Livia was also adopted into the Iulian\r\n_gens_ and was to take his name. She was thenceforth therefore known as\r\nIulia Augusta, and seems to have assumed that thereby she obtained a\r\ncertain share in the imperial prerogatives, a claim which led to much\r\nfriction between herself and her son.\r\n\r\nBesides the will, and a roll containing directions as to his funeral,\r\nthere were two other documents drawn up by Augustus with great care.\r\nOne was a _breviarium totius imperii_, an exact account of the state of\r\nthe Empire, the number of soldiers under colours, the amount of money\r\nin the treasury or the _fiscus_, the arrears due, and the names of\r\nthose freedmen who were to be held responsible. As a kind of appendix\r\nto this were some maxims of state which he wished to impress upon his\r\nsuccessor: such as, not to extend the citizenship too widely, but to\r\nmaintain the distinction between Roman and subject; to select able men\r\nfor administrative duties, but not to allow them to become too powerful\r\nor think themselves indispensable; and not to extend the frontiers of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nA third roll contained a statement of his own services and achievements\r\n(_index rerum a se gestarum_). Meant to be preserved as an inscription,\r\nit is in what we might call the telegraphic style, a series of brief\r\nstatements of facts without note or comment beyond the suggestiveness of\r\na word here and there designedly used. Yet it is essentially a defence\r\nof his life and policy\xe2\x80\x94the oldest extant autobiography. He directed it\r\nto be engraved on bronze columns and set up outside the Mausoleum. This\r\nwas no doubt done, but the bronze columns have long ago disappeared.[316]\r\nFortunately, however, copies of the inscription were engraved elsewhere\r\n(with a Greek translation) in temples of \xe2\x80\x9cRome and Augustus,\xe2\x80\x9d as at\r\nApollonia in Pisidia and Ancyra in Galatia. That at Ancyra (_Angora_)\r\nexists nearly complete to this day, and some portions at Apollonia. No\r\nlife of Augustus could be complete without this document, which is\r\ntherefore given in an English dress at the end of this book.\r\n\r\nThe Senate at once proceeded to decree divine honours to him. A temple\r\nwas to be built at Rome, which was afterwards consecrated by Livia and\r\nTiberius. Others were erected elsewhere, and the house at Nola in which\r\nhe died was consecrated. His image on a gilded couch was placed in the\r\ntemple of Mars, and festivals (_Augustalia_) were established with a\r\ncollege of Augustales to maintain them in all parts of the Empire, as\r\nwell as an annual festival on the Palatine which continued to be held by\r\nsucceeding Emperors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rumours as to the death of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nThe usual foolish rumours followed his death. Some said that Tiberius\r\ndid not reach Nola in time to see him alive; that he had died some\r\ntime before, but that Livia closed the doors and concealed the truth.\r\nOthers even said that his death had been hastened by Livia by means of\r\na poisoned fig; and professed to explain it by a piece of secret court\r\nhistory. Shortly before his death, they said, Augustus had gone attended\r\nonly by Fabius Maximus on a secret visit to Agrippa Postumus in the\r\nisland of Planasia, to which he had been confined since the cancelling\r\nof his adoption in A.D. 5; and that Livia fearing that he would relent\r\ntowards him and name him as successor, determined that he should not live\r\nto do so, Fabius Maximus having meanwhile died suddenly and somewhat\r\nmysteriously. But the authentic accounts of his last illness and death\r\ngive the lie to such an unnecessary crime. Unhappily the jealousy of\r\nthe unfortunate Agrippa Postumus was a fact which helped to spread such\r\nstories, but it was a jealousy roused by the knowledge of some secret\r\nplots to carry him off and set him up as a rival, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe first crime\r\nof the new reign\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his assassination by his guards\xe2\x80\x94must, we fear, lie at\r\nthe door of either Tiberius or Livia. Another report was that the soul of\r\nAugustus flew up to heaven in the shape of an eagle that rose from his\r\npyre. Nor must the ingenious Senator\xe2\x80\x94Numerius Atticus\xe2\x80\x94be omitted, who\r\ndeclared on oath that he had seen the soul of the Emperor ascending, and\r\nwas said to have received a present of 25,000 denarii (about \xc2\xa31,000) from\r\nLivia in acknowledgment of this loyal clearness of vision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The continuous government.]\r\n\r\nThe prudent forethought of Augustus in regard to the succession answered\r\nits purpose. There was practically no break in the government. Tiberius\r\nwas possessed of _tribunicia potestas_, which enabled him to summon and\r\nconsult the Senate. He also, in virtue of his proconsular imperium,\r\ngave the watchword to the pr\xc3\xa6torian guard, and despatched orders to the\r\nlegions in service in the provinces. There was, indeed, some question\r\nas to whether this imperium legally terminated with the death of the\r\n_princeps_, but the matter was settled by all classes taking the oath\r\n(_sacramentum_) to him, and all the powers and honours (except the title\r\nof _pater patri\xc3\xa6_, which he would not accept) were shortly afterwards\r\nvoted to him in the Senate and confirmed by a _lex_. His professed\r\nreluctance to accept the whole burden only brought out more clearly how\r\nthe work of Augustus had made the rule of a single man inevitable: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nask you, sir, which part of the government you wish to have committed\r\nto you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Asinius Gallus. No answer was possible. A man could not\r\ncontrol the provinces without command of the army. But he could not\r\ncontrol the army if another man controlled the exchequer. He could not\r\nkeep order in Rome and Italy, if another had command of all the legions\r\nand fleets abroad, and could at any moment invade the country or starve\r\nit out by stopping the corn-ships. And if a man had the full control of\r\nthe purse and the sword, the rest followed. It was well enough for the\r\nofficials to have the old titles and perform some of the old work, but if\r\nthe central authority were once removed there would be chaos. The Senate\r\nhad attempted to exercise that central authority and failed. It could not\r\nsecure the loyalty of men who, exercising undisturbed power in distant\r\nlands, soon grew impatient of the control of a body of mixed elements\r\nand divergent views, which they often conceived to be under the influence\r\nof cliques inimical to themselves. The provinces too as they became\r\nmore Romanised were certain to claim to be put on a more equal status\r\nwith Italy: they could only be held together by a man who had equal\r\nauthority everywhere, never by a local town council. Augustus, indeed,\r\ndid not realise this development, or rather he feared its advent. In his\r\neyes Rome ought still to rule, but could only do so by all its powers\r\nbeing centred in one man, who could consult the interest and attract the\r\nreverence of all parts of the Empire alike. The success of this plan\r\ndepended, of course, on the character of the man, and perhaps, above all,\r\non his abilities as a financier; but, at any rate, it was impossible\r\nto return to a system of divided functions, and constitutional checks,\r\nwhich were shewn to be inoperative the moment a magistrate drew the sword\r\nand defied them. So far the work of Augustus stood, and admitted of no\r\nreaction. Republican ideals could only be entertained as pious opinions,\r\nnot more practical than some of the republican virtues, on the belief in\r\nwhich they were founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AUGUSTUS, HIS CHARACTER AND AIMS, HIS WORK AND FRIENDS\r\n\r\n    _Hic vir hic est, tibi quem_\r\n    _promitti s\xc3\xa6pius audis._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The early career and change of character.]\r\n\r\nWhen a great piece of work has been done in the world it is not difficult\r\nto find fault with it. A man seldom if ever sees the bearing and ultimate\r\nresults of his own actions, or carries out all that he intended to do.\r\nEven when he seems to have done so, time reveals faults, miscalculations,\r\nfailures. At an age when among us a boy is just leaving school, Augustus\r\nfound himself the heir of a great policy and a great name amidst the\r\nruins of a constitution and the _disjecta membra_ of a great Empire.\r\nA comparatively small city state had conquered the greater part of\r\nthe known world, and proposed to govern it by the machinery which had\r\nsufficed when its territory was insignificant, not extending at any rate\r\nbeyond the shores of Italy. A close corporation, greedy and licentious,\r\nhad divided amongst its members the vast profits from the gradually\r\nextending dominions. The central authority which should have restrained\r\nthe rulers of distant provinces and the collection of their revenues\r\nwas composed to a great extent of those most deeply interested in the\r\ncorruptions which it was their duty to judge and condemn. Loyalty to this\r\ncentral authority grew weaker and weaker, party spirit grew stronger\r\nand less scrupulous. In the desperate struggle for wealth and luxury men\r\nstuck at nothing. Bloodshed bred bloodshed, violence provoked violence,\r\ntill good citizens and honourable men (and there were always such) found\r\nthemselves helpless; and the constitution which had rested on the loyalty\r\nof magistrates and citizens was ready to fall at the first touch of\r\nresolute disobedience. Then a great man appeared. Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar had not\r\nbeen free from the vices or corruption of his contemporaries; but party\r\nconnections at home led him to sympathise with the people, and the ten\r\nyears of war and government in Gaul, during which his enemies at home\r\nwere constantly threatening and thwarting him, had convinced him that\r\nthe existing constitution was doomed. He was resolved to attempt its\r\nreconstruction, even at the risk of civil war. But civil war is a sea\r\nof unknown extent. Conqueror though he was in all its battles, it left\r\nhim only a few months to elaborate reforms. In those he did some great\r\nthings; but his revival of the Sullan Dictatorship was too crude a return\r\nto monarchy, while the exigencies of civil war forced him to employ\r\ninferior agents. The aristocratic clique saw themselves about to lose\r\ntheir cherished privilege of tyranny and extortion, and they killed him.\r\n\r\nWhen Octavian came home to take up his inheritance, he would naturally\r\nhave joined Antony, and taken immediate vengeance on the guilty clique.\r\nBut he found him intent upon the consolidation of his own position,\r\nand not inclined to admit his claim to the inheritance or to any share\r\nof power. He therefore outwardly joined the leaders of the party which\r\nhe detested in order to get rid of Antony and forestall his bid for\r\nautocracy. The vicissitudes of the struggle which followed, ending in\r\nthe triumvirate and the division of the Roman world, infected him with\r\nthe poison of civil strife\xe2\x80\x94the cruelty which treats honourable enemies\r\nas outlaws, and regards personal triumph as the only end of political\r\nexertion. This period in his career and in the development of his\r\ncharacter ends with the victory over Sextus Pompeius, in B.C. 36, and the\r\nadditional security gained by the successes of Agrippa in Gaul during the\r\ntwo preceding years. From that time he began to regard himself as the\r\nchampion of law and order, as the defender of Italy, and the guarantee of\r\npeace in the Western Provinces.\r\n\r\nThen came a great danger\xe2\x80\x94the danger of a separation of East and West.\r\nUnder the influence of his passion for Cleopatra, Antony was building\r\nup a new empire of subordinate kings, it is true, but subordinate to\r\nAlexandria not Rome: and Alexandria was being adorned with the spoils\r\nof Asiatic temples to make it a worthy capital of the Eastern world.\r\nHow far this was really to involve a diminution of the Roman Empire\r\nwas probably not clear to Antony himself. The old provinces were not\r\nformally separated, but they were pared and diminished to round off the\r\nnew kingdoms for his and Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s children. At Rome the danger was\r\nlooked upon as a real one; and once more Augustus felt that if he was to\r\nhave a free hand in the renovation of the Empire which he contemplated,\r\nAntony must disappear. No doubt every artifice was employed to discredit\r\nhis opponent, and to convince the Roman people that their dominion in\r\nthe East was slipping from them. But, however Machiavellian his tactics,\r\nthere was a solid basis of fact beneath them; a real danger or separation\r\nhad existed. The victory of Actium settled that question; and when\r\nthe few severities which followed it were over, we are happily called\r\nthenceforth to contemplate the legislator and reformer, the administrator\r\nof, on the whole, a peaceful Empire. There were no more civil wars, and\r\nno serious conspiracies. With rare exceptions\xe2\x80\x94perhaps only the Arabian\r\nexpedition\xe2\x80\x94the wars in which Augustus was henceforth engaged were the\r\nnecessary consequences of a long frontier. War was often prevented by\r\ndiplomacy, and such wars as were undertaken were always successful,\r\nwith the exception of those with the Germans, and even in their case\r\nimmediate danger was averted.\r\n\r\nThe moral problem presented by the change from ruthless cruelty to wise\r\nand persistent clemency has exercised the minds of philosophers and\r\nhistorians ever since. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not clemency,\xe2\x80\x9d says Seneca, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a surfeit\r\nof cruelty.\xe2\x80\x9d But this explains nothing. If Augustus had ever been cruel\r\nfor cruelty\xe2\x80\x99s sake, the increased opportunities of exercising it would\r\nhave whetted his appetite for blood as it did in some of his successors.\r\nIt was circumstances that had changed, not altogether the man. Still, no\r\ndoubt, success softened (it does not always) Augustus\xe2\x80\x99s character. His\r\nministers were humane men and in favour of milder methods; his wife was\r\na high-minded woman, and always ready to succour distress, as she shewed\r\nduring the proscriptions, and afterwards in her son\xe2\x80\x99s reign. He had among\r\nhis immediate friends philosophers and men of letters, whose influence,\r\nso far as it went, was humanising. And lastly such opposition as still\r\nexisted was no longer of irreconcilables who had known \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d; a\r\nnew generation had grown up which on the whole acquiesced in the peace\r\nand security of a benevolent despotism. It was a new era, and Augustus\r\nbecame a new man. Full of honours and possessed with irresistible powers,\r\nfeeling the responsibility heavily, and often in vain desiring rest, he\r\nhad no farther personal object to gain beyond the credit of having served\r\nhis country and saved the Empire. The apologia of the _index rerum_,\r\nbrief and bald as it is, was intended to shew that he had done this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The value of his work.]\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of his work we are met with this difficulty at\r\nthe very threshold of the inquiry, that his object was to avoid quick and\r\nconspicuous changes. Instead of discussing some heroic measure we have\r\nto examine a multitude of details. In every department of political and\r\nsocial life we trace his hand. Working day and night, he was scheming\r\nto alter what he thought bad, and to introduce what he thought good.\r\nThe reconstruction and embellishment of the city, the restoration of\r\nreligion, the rehabilitation of marriage, measures necessary for the\r\nsecurity of Rome and Italy, for the better government and material\r\nprosperity of the provinces, for the solvency of the exchequer, and for\r\nthe protection of commerce\xe2\x80\x94all these continually occupied his time and\r\nhis thoughts. Of this steady industry this or that result may be open to\r\ncriticism, but, on the whole, it seems certain that it increased the good\r\norder and prosperity of the Empire, and therefore added to the comfort\r\nand happiness of innumerable lives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages and disadvantages of the autocracy.]\r\n\r\nBut of course the upshot of it all was the establishment of a monarchy;\r\nand it still remains to be considered how far its benefits were\r\ncounterbalanced by evils arising from the loss of freedom. It might be\r\nargued that tyrants always appeal to their right use of power however\r\nirregularly obtained, but that the plea is beside the question. Freedom\r\nis the only guarantee of the _continuance_ of good government. The\r\nbeneficent tyrant may any day be succeeded by a bad one. The policy of\r\nAugustus had led the people on step by step to forfeit this freedom,\r\nand lose even the taste for it, lulled to sleep by the charms of safety\r\nand luxury. When the glamour had faded from some eyes, it was too late.\r\nThe generation which had known freedom had disappeared; the experience\r\nnecessary for working the old machinery no longer existed. The few who\r\nstill remembered with regret the old constitution, under which they had\r\nhoped to take an independent share of political activity, had nothing\r\nleft to them but sullen submission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the provinces.]\r\n\r\nIn the provinces, indeed, this consideration did not apply. The despotism\r\nthere added to the sum of happiness and took nothing away. They had lost\r\ntheir independence long ago. They were already under a master, a master\r\nwho was changed at short intervals, whom it was very difficult to bring\r\nto an account if he were oppressive, in whose selection they had had\r\nabsolutely no share, and whose character they had no means of calculating\r\nbeforehand. They might one year be enjoying all the benefits of an able\r\nand disinterested ruler, the next they might find themselves in the power\r\nof a tyrannical extortioner, selfish, cynical, cruel. The old republican\r\nnames and ideals were nothing to them; or rather they suggested organised\r\noppression and a conspiracy to refuse redress. The change to one master,\r\nwho had everything to gain by their prosperity, and was at the same\r\ntime master of their old oppressors, must have seemed in every respect\r\na blessing. If there was any drawback it was that nationality and the\r\ndesire for self-government were killed by kindness. In all difficulties\r\nand disasters they looked to the Emperor for aid and seldom looked in\r\nvain. In the East especially this was probably not wholesome; yet the\r\nimmediate effects in producing prosperity and comfort were marked enough\r\nto put aside for the present all such scruples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Italy.]\r\n\r\nBut for the governing nation itself, while some of the benefits were\r\nno less manifest, the mischievous results were more easy to point out.\r\nMaterial prosperity was much increased. The city was made a pleasant\r\nand attractive place of residence. Italy was partially repeopled with\r\nan industrious class. Commerce was encouraged and protected, literature\r\nand the fine arts were fostered, and the Palace on the whole set a good\r\nexample of simplicity of living. But, on the other hand, the rule of a\r\nsingle person stifled political life. By the system of _cur\xc3\xa6_ or special\r\ncommissions all administrative work was transferred to nominees of the\r\nEmperor, who were often his intimate friends, or even his freedmen,\r\nbound to him by the closest ties of subordination. The old magistracies\r\nbecame unattractive, not only because they no longer led as a matter of\r\ncourse to profitable employment abroad, but because their holders had\r\nlittle of interest to do. The Senate, though treated with respect and\r\nretaining some importance as a high court of justice, was practically no\r\nlonger a governing body. It was wholly at the beck of the Emperor, and\r\nsuch work of consequence as it still performed was often transacted by\r\nsmall committees, the main body merely assenting. In spite, therefore,\r\nof the dignity of the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s position, it ceased to attract the best\r\nmen. The higher classes turned away from a political career, and gave\r\nthemselves up more and more to luxurious idleness. The rise of the\r\nfreedman\xe2\x80\x94practically the rule of favourites\xe2\x80\x94was clearly foreshadowed,\r\nthough owing to the industry of Augustus, and his genius for detail, it\r\ndid not become prominent in his time. As the upper classes were thus to\r\na certain extent demoralised by the Principate, so the city proletariat\r\nwas pampered and made still more effete. The city was made only too\r\nattractive to them, and they were to be kept in good humour by an endless\r\nseries of games and shows. There was a good deal of truth in the retort\r\nof the player Pylades, when reproved by Augustus for his feud with\r\nBathyllus, that it was for the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s advantage that the people should\r\nhave their attention fixed on the playhouse rather than on politics.\r\nBut they soon began not only to regard these amusements as their right:\r\nthey expected also to be fed at the cost of the government, whether by\r\ndirect gifts of money, or by the distribution of cheap or even gratuitous\r\ncorn. Nor can it be said that the amusements provided for them were of\r\nan elevating nature. Augustus boasts in the _Index_ (c. 20), that he\r\ngave seven shows of gladiators in his own name or that of his sons, in\r\nwhich about 10,000 men in all had fought;[317] and besides other games\r\ntwenty-six _venationes_ of \xe2\x80\x9cAfrican beasts,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._, mostly elephants, in\r\nwhich about 3,500 were killed. The mob of Rome needed little brutalising,\r\nbut they got it in abundance.\r\n\r\nWith such drawbacks, however, it still must be owned that the\r\nadministration of Augustus largely increased the sum of human happiness\r\nby the mitigation of oppression in the provinces, and by the suppression\r\nof disorder in Rome and Italy. The finances were placed on a sound\r\nfooting, property was rendered secure, and men felt everywhere that they\r\nmight pursue their business with every chance of enjoying the fruits of\r\ntheir labours. This was something after a century of revolution more or\r\nless acute, and twenty years of downright civil war. It is worth while to\r\nattempt to picture to ourselves the man who was the author of these good\r\nand bad results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The personal appearance and character of Augustus.]\r\n\r\nAugustus was a short man (just under five feet seven inches), but so well\r\nproportioned that the defect in height was not noticed unless he was\r\nstanding by much taller men. He was remarkably handsome at all periods of\r\nhis life, with an expression of calm dignity, whether silent or speaking,\r\nwhich involuntarily inspired respect. His eyes were grey, and so bright\r\nand keen that it was not easy to meet their gaze. If he had a personal\r\nvanity it was in regard to them. He liked to think that they dazzled\r\nthose on whom he looked, and he was pleased at the answer of the Roman\r\neques, who, when asked why he turned away, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I could not\r\nbear the lightning of your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d Vergil gratified this vanity of his\r\npatron when in the description of the battle of Actium (_\xc3\x86n._, viii. 650)\r\nhe pictures him,\r\n\r\n    _Stans celsa in puppi; geminas cui tempora flammas_\r\n    _L\xc3\xa6ta vomunt._\r\n\r\nAnd the Emperor Iulian, in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Banquet of the Emperors,\xe2\x80\x9d laughs not\r\nunkindly at the same weakness when he introduces him, \xe2\x80\x9cchanging colour\r\nlike a chameleon, and wishing that the beams darting from his eyes\r\nshould be like those of the mighty sun.\xe2\x80\x9d The busts, statues, and coins\r\nof Augustus fully confirm this statement as to his beauty; and in the\r\ntriumphal statue found in Livia\xe2\x80\x99s villa at Prima Porta, the artist has\r\nsucceeded in suggesting the brightness and keenness of his eyes. He was\r\nusually clean shaven, but from his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s death to B.C. 38, according\r\nto Dio (48, 34), he grew his beard as a sign of mourning; though coins\r\nshowed him with a slight whisker till about B.C. 36. These portraits\r\nare full of life and character. The clear-cut features, the firm mouth\r\nand chin, the steady eyes, the carelessly ordered hair, the lines on\r\nforehead and cheeks, suggest a man who had suffered and laboured, who was\r\nyet self-controlled, calm, and clear-headed. It is a face not without\r\nsome tenderness, but capable of firing up into hot indignation and even\r\ncruelty. There is an air of suffering but of determined victory over\r\npain; altogether a face of a man who had done a great work and risen\r\nto a high place in the world and knew it; who had confidence, lastly,\r\nin his star. On taking leave of Gaius C\xc3\xa6sar, it is said, he wished him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe integrity of Pompey, the courage of Alexander, and his own good\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d On some of his coins beneath the head crowned with the crown\r\nof twelve rays, is the Iulian star, first observed at the funeral of\r\nIulius C\xc3\xa6sar, and which he adopted as the sign of his own high fortunes:\r\non others the Sphinx, which he at first adopted as his signet\xe2\x80\x94emblem\r\nperhaps of a purpose unbetrayed. Augustus was accomplished in the\r\nsubjects recognised in the education of his time, though he neither wrote\r\nnor spoke Greek with ease. He had studied and practised rhetoric, and\r\nhad a good and correct taste in style, avoiding the use of far-fetched\r\nor obsolete words and expressions, or affected conceits. He ridiculed\r\nAntony for his \xe2\x80\x9cAsiatic\xe2\x80\x9d style of oratory, full of flowers of speech and\r\nflamboyant sentences; and writing to his granddaughter, Agrippina, while\r\npraising her abilities he warns her against pedantic expressions whether\r\nin conversation or writing. Without being an orator, he spoke clearly\r\nand to the point, assisted by a pleasant voice, which he took pains to\r\npreserve and improve. In the Senate, the camp, and private conferences,\r\nhe preferred to read his speeches, though he could also speak well on\r\nthe spur of the moment. In domestic life, though somewhat strict, he\r\nwas generally simple and charming. He lived much with wife and children,\r\nassociating himself with their employments, and even joining in the games\r\nof the latter. He personally superintended the education of his adopted\r\nsons, taught them his own method of shorthand, and interested himself in\r\ntheir reading. He had old-fashioned ideas about the proper employment of\r\nthe women in his family. They were expected to busy themselves in weaving\r\nfor the use of the household, to visit and receive visits only with his\r\napproval, and not to converse on subjects that could not with propriety\r\nbe entered on the day\xe2\x80\x99s journal. Though his daughter and granddaughters\r\nwere well educated, and had a taste for literature, it may well be\r\nthat a home thus conducted was so dull as partly to account for their\r\naberrations in the fuller liberty of married life.\r\n\r\nHis attachments were warm and constant, and he was not illiberal to\r\nhis friends or disinclined to give them his full confidence. But he\r\nwas always his own master. No friend or freedman gained control over\r\nhim or rose to the odious position of \xe2\x80\x9cfavourite.\xe2\x80\x9d He allowed and even\r\nliked freedom of speech, but it was always without loss of dignity. He\r\nwas not a man with whom liberties were taken even by the most intimate.\r\nHe was quick tempered, but knew it, and was ready to admit of caution\r\nand advice, as in the well-known story of M\xc3\xa6cenas, watching him in\r\ncourt about to condemn a number of prisoners (probably in the civil\r\nwar times), and throwing across to him a note with the words, _Surge\r\ntandem carnifex!_ \xe2\x80\x9cTis time to rise, hangman!\xe2\x80\x9d Or when he received with\r\ncomplaisance the advice of Athenodorus (hero of the covered sedan) that\r\nwhen he was angry he should say over the letters of the alphabet before\r\ncoming to a decision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His ultra-Roman views.]\r\n\r\nIn later times he was always looked back upon by his successors as the\r\ntrue founder of the Empire, and the best model for their guidance;\r\nyet it is doubtful how far he had wide and far-reaching views. He was\r\na statesman who dealt with facts as he found them and did the best\r\nhe could. He was deeply impressed with the difficulty of his task.\r\nCommenting on the fact of Alexander the Great having accomplished his\r\nconquests by the age of 32, and then feeling at a loss what to do for the\r\nrest of his life, he remarked that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas surprised that Alexander did\r\nnot regard the right ordering of the empire he possessed a heavier task\r\nthan winning it.\xe2\x80\x9d But in one important respect at least he was wrong in\r\nhis idea of what he had done. He never conceived of an empire filled with\r\ncitizens enjoying equal rights, or in which Rome could possibly occupy a\r\nsecondary place. He was ultra-Roman in his views; and worked and schemed\r\nto maintain the supremacy of the Eternal City. That supremacy may indeed\r\nbe said to have remained to this day in the region of spiritual affairs.\r\nBut it was destined to disappear politically, except in name, before many\r\ngenerations had passed away, and as a logical consequence of much that\r\nhe had himself done. A new Rome and a new Empire\xe2\x80\x94though always resting\r\non the old title and theory\xe2\x80\x94were to arise, in which Italy would be a\r\nprovince like the rest, and old Rome but the shadow of a mighty name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The court circle.]\r\n\r\nAmong those who exercised a permanent influence on Augustus, the first\r\nplace must be given to LIVIA (B.C. 54-A.D. 29). The writers on Augustus\r\ncomment on the romantic revolution of her fortunes. After the affair of\r\nPerusia she fled with her husband, Nero, and her little son, Tiberius,\r\nfrom Augustus, who was to be her husband, and was to be succeeded by her\r\nson. Her divorce and prompt marriage to Augustus, while within a few\r\nmonths of being again a mother, is not only a thing revolting to our\r\nideas, it was strictly against Roman principles and habits, and required\r\nall her new husband\xe2\x80\x99s commanding influence to be admitted as legal. Yet\r\nSuetonius says, and says truly, that he continued \xe2\x80\x9cto love and honour her\r\nexclusively to the end\xe2\x80\x9d (_dilexit et probavit unice et perseveranter_).\r\nThe same writer gives an account of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s intrigues with other\r\nwomen. To our ideas the two statements are contradictory, but Suetonius\r\nwould not have thought so. Conjugal love was not _amor_; the latter was\r\nthought even inconsistent with, or at least undesirable in, conjugal\r\naffection. He means that throughout his life Augustus continued to\r\nregard her with affection, to respect her character, and give weight to\r\nher opinion. For my own part, I believe that something more might be\r\nsaid, and that much of what has come down to us as to the conduct of the\r\nEmperor may be dismissed as malignant gossip. But however that may be,\r\nthe influence of Livia over him seems never to have failed, and it was\r\nexercised on the side of clemency and generosity. She set an excellent\r\nexample of pure and dignified conduct to Roman society, and, though\r\nabstaining from interference generally in political matters, was ready to\r\ngive advice when called upon. She seems usually to have accompanied him,\r\nwhen possible, on his foreign progresses or residences away from Rome.\r\nWhen Herod visited Augustus at Aquileia in B.C. 14, she appears to have\r\nshared her husband\xe2\x80\x99s liking for that strange medley of magnificence and\r\ncruelty, and sent him costly gifts for the festivity which accompanied\r\nthe completion of the new city of C\xc3\xa6sarea Sebaste in B.C. 13. The usual\r\nallegation against her is that she worked for the succession of her\r\nsons, Tiberius and Drusus, as against the Iulian family, represented\r\nby the son of Octavia and the children of Iulia. To secure this object\r\nshe was accused in popular rumour of compassing the deaths successively\r\nof Marcellus, of Gaius and Lucius C\xc3\xa6sar, of Agrippa Postumus, and,\r\nfinally, of having even hastened the end of Augustus himself. This last\r\nis not mentioned by Suetonius, and is only related by Dio as a report,\r\nfor which he gives no evidence, and which he does not appear to have\r\nbelieved. Tacitus records the criticism of her as a _gravis noverca_ to\r\nthe family of the C\xc3\xa6sars, and seems to accept her guilt in regard to\r\nGaius and Iulius (_Ann._ 4, 71). But he is also constrained to admit that\r\nshe exercised a humanising influence over Tiberius, that his victims\r\nconstantly found refuge and protection in her palace, and that she was\r\nbenevolent and charitable to the poor\xe2\x80\x94maintaining a large number of\r\norphan boys and girls by her bounty. The most suspicious case against\r\nher is the execution of Agrippa Postumus immediately after the death\r\nof Augustus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe first crime of the new reign.\xe2\x80\x9d It will never be known\r\nwhether the order for that cruel deed issued from her or her crafty\r\nson. The death of Marcellus was in no way suspicious, as it occurred in\r\na season of exceptional unhealthiness, when large numbers were dying\r\nat Rome of malarial fever. As to the deaths of Gaius and Lucius, no\r\nsuspicion seems to have occurred to Augustus, and he was keenly anxious\r\nfor their survival. The poisoned fig supposed to have been given to\r\nhimself is a familiar feature in the stories of great men\xe2\x80\x99s death of\r\nevery age in Italy. Tacitus in the famous summing up of her character,\r\nwhile acknowledging the purity of her domestic conduct, yet declares that\r\nher social manners were more free than was considered becoming among\r\nwomen of an earlier time; that as a mother she was extravagantly fond, as\r\na wife too complaisant; and that her character was a combination of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s adroitness and her son\xe2\x80\x99s insincerity. He by no means intends to\r\ndraw a pleasing portrait. He seldom does. But what we may take for true\r\nis that she was beautiful, loyal to her husband, open-handed and generous\r\nto the distressed, merciful and kind to the unfortunate. To those who\r\nthink such qualities likely to belong to a poisoner and murderess, her\r\ncondemnation must be left. It is curious that neither Vergil, Horace, nor\r\nPropertius mention or allude to Livia; nor does Ovid do so until after\r\nthe death of Augustus\xe2\x80\x94for the _consolatio ad Liviam_ on the death of\r\nDrusus is not his. On some of the inscriptions of a later period in the\r\nreign her name appears among the imperial family as wife of the Princeps.\r\nThat was itself an innovation, and it seems as if the poets abstained\r\nfrom mentioning her under orders. It was improper for a matron of high\r\nrank to be made public property in this way. Horace, for instance, only\r\nonce alludes to the wife of M\xc3\xa6cenas, and then under a feigned name.\r\n\r\nOf those who influenced the earlier policy of Augustus, and supported\r\nhim in the first twenty years of the Principate, the first place must be\r\ngiven to Agrippa and M\xc3\xa6cenas.\r\n\r\nM. VIPSANIUS AGRIPPA (B.C. 63-13), differed widely from M\xc3\xa6cenas, but\r\nwas like him in constant attachment and fidelity to Augustus. He was\r\nwith him in Apollonia, and on the news of the murder of Iulius advised\r\nan appeal to the army. Even before this he had accompanied him to Spain\r\nwhen he went to join his uncle in B.C. 45, and ever afterwards served him\r\nwith unswerving fidelity and conspicuous success. In the war with Sextus\r\nPompeius, at Perusia, in Gaul, Spain and Illyria, in the organisation of\r\nthe East, and on the Bosporus, it was his energy and ability that decided\r\nthe contest in favour of his master, or secured the settlement that he\r\ndesired. He was the organiser of the Roman navy, and though his great\r\nwork at the Lucrine lake proved to be only temporary, the squadrons that\r\nguarded the seas at Misenum, Ravenna and Forum Iulii were the result\r\nof his activity and foresight. His acts of splendid liberality in Rome\r\nhave been already noticed. He shewed the same magnificence in Gaul and\r\nelsewhere, and seems also to have largely assisted in the great survey\r\nof the empire instituted by Augustus. Not only did he support all the\r\nplans and ideas of his master, he was ready to take any position and make\r\nany personal sacrifice to further his views. After his first marriage\r\nto Pomponia, by whom he was the father of Vipsania, he was married to\r\nMarcella, the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s niece. To support his master\xe2\x80\x99s plans for the\r\nsuccession he submitted to divorce her and marry Iulia, after having\r\npreviously made way for the rise of Marcellus by accepting a command in\r\nthe East. The Emperor shewed his confidence in him on every occasion. In\r\nB.C. 23 when he thought himself dying he placed his seal in his hands,\r\nin B.C. 18 he caused him to be admitted to share his tribunician power\r\nfor five years, which was renewed again in B.C. 13; so that though his\r\ntwo sons were adopted by Augustus, the succession would almost certainly\r\nhave fallen to him had the Emperor died in their minority. This elevation\r\nhowever did not give him rest: the last years of his life were spent\r\nin the East, on the Bosporus and in Pannonia, from which last he only\r\nreturned to die. This faithful service had been rendered in spite of\r\nthe fact that he had advised against the acceptance of the principate.\r\nHe had urged the financial difficulties, the irreconcilable nature of\r\nthe opposition, the impossibility of drawing back, and Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nweak health. But when his master preferred the advice of M\xc3\xa6cenas, he\r\ntook his part in the undertaking without faltering and with splendid\r\nloyalty. Though Augustus owed much of his success to his own cautious\r\nstatesmanship, he owed even more to the man who failed in nothing that he\r\nundertook, and would claim no honour for himself in return. The Emperor\r\ndelivered the funeral oration over this loyal servant, and, deposited his\r\nashes in the Mausoleum which he had built for his own family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M\xc3\x86CENAS.\r\n\r\n_Photographed from the Head in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, by\r\nEdne.

CILNIUS M\xc3\x86CENAS (_circ._ B.C. 65-B.C. 8), was probably a few years\r\nolder than Augustus, but near enough to his age to have been one of\r\nhis companions at Apollonia. His influence was maintained till about\r\nB.C. 16. It is most conspicuous from the time immediately following the\r\nPerusian war. He negotiated the marriage with Scribonia, the peace of\r\nBrundisium with Antony (B.C. 40), and the subsequent reconciliation of\r\nB.C. 38. In the war against Sextus Pompeius (B.C. 38-36), he was partly\r\nwith Augustus, but partly at Rome, with full powers to act for him and\r\neven to alter his despatches and letters as seemed necessary, having\r\nthe triumvir\xe2\x80\x99s private seal entrusted to him for that purpose. This\r\nwas possible from the fact of such letters being written by amanuenses\r\nand being therefore only recognisable by the seal. Thus Cicero often\r\ncommissions Atticus to write formal letters to his friends for him.\r\nThis position\xe2\x80\x94it was no definite office, or perhaps was more like being\r\n_legatus_ to Octavian than anything else\xe2\x80\x94he seems to have retained\r\ntill after the battle of Actium, at which he probably was not present,\r\nthough that has been disputed. He detected the conspiracy of the younger\r\nLepidus, and sent him to Octavian to be judged. In B.C. 29, on Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn from the East, he recommended the establishment of a despotism,\r\nas a republic was no longer possible. The speech preserved by Dio (52,\r\n14-40) may very well be genuine, in view of the habit of the day, and\r\nof Augustus himself, of reading addresses even in comparatively private\r\nconferences on matters of importance.[318] Even if it is not the genuine\r\nspeech, it correctly represents many of the principles on which Augustus\r\ndid act, and as to which he doubtless consulted M\xc3\xa6cenas. It counsels him\r\nto keep in his hands legislation, foreign affairs, elections, executive\r\nappointments and the courts of law, and to hear cases of appeal himself:\r\nexactly what Augustus did under various disguises. It argues that it\r\nwas necessary both for his own safety and that of the state that he\r\nshould remain in power, the glory being well worth the risk. Other\r\nrecommendations are a reform of Senate and equites, the maintenance of\r\nthe old republican magistrates for home service, the establishment of a\r\n_pr\xc3\xa6fectus urbi_, the exercise by himself of censorial functions, the\r\nsubordination of provincial governors to the Emperor, and their payment\r\nby a fixed salary, with the appointment of procurators to superintend\r\nthe finances of the provinces. A system of education for the equites\r\nis also suggested, which does not seem to have been carried out; but\r\nmany of the financial proposals were adopted, as well as the idea of\r\nkeeping the people amused by games and shows. The advice to abolish the\r\n_comitia_ Augustus could not follow consistently with his policy of\r\ncompromise. They remained and were the causes of more than one trouble\r\nand disturbance, but their freedom of election was gradually but surely\r\ndestroyed, and one of the first measures of Tiberius was to abolish them\r\nas no longer a reality. The reform of the Senate was, as we have seen,\r\ncarried out. As for the judicia, the Senate became a high court for cases\r\nof treason (_maiestas_), before which alone Senators could be tried;\r\nthe _decuri\xc3\xa6 iudicum_ were reformed, and Augustus himself performed\r\nthe functions of a court of appeal in various ways, sometimes by his\r\ntribunician power of \xe2\x80\x9cinterceding\xe2\x80\x9d against the sentences of magistrates\r\nor Senate, and sometimes by hearing cases from the provinces of citizens\r\nwho disputed the competence of provincial courts and claimed to be\r\nheard at Rome. M\xc3\xa6cenas holding no office never became a Senator; but he\r\nrepresented the Emperor in his absence, unless Agrippa was appointed to\r\ndo so instead. In this capacity he really exercised a greater power than\r\nany definite office would have given him, and the whole business of the\r\nEmpire passed through his hands.[319]\r\n\r\nBut it was not only as the ostensible representative of the Emperor that\r\nhe worked for his support. In the comparative retirement of his palace on\r\nthe Esquiline he contributed to that object by gathering round him the\r\nbest intellects and first men of letters of the day, whom he induced to\r\ndevote their talents not only to glorify the Emperor personally, but to\r\npopularise his policy and magnify his service to the state. How far this\r\nmay have been effectual by making it the fashion to accept and admire the\r\nprincipate may perhaps be questioned, but that he should have secured\r\nsuch writers as Vergil, Horace, and Propertius on his side says much for\r\nhis insight and literary taste. One of the weaknesses of the position\r\nof Iulius had been that he had the literary class mostly against him.\r\nThe present reputation and future fame of Augustus were to be better\r\nsafeguarded. Personally M\xc3\xa6cenas was luxurious and effeminate, always a\r\nvaletudinarian, and in his later years afflicted with almost constant\r\ninsomnia. This accounts well enough for the retirement from public\r\nbusiness during the last eight years of his life without those other\r\ncauses of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure which have been already discussed.\r\nHis wife was a beauty, much younger than himself, wilful and wayward;\r\nand if it is true that she intrigued with Augustus, it seems also true\r\nthat her husband repaid her in kind. There were frequent quarrels and\r\nreconciliations, so that Seneca says that he married her \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand\r\ntimes;\xe2\x80\x9d and once at any rate the family trouble found its way into the\r\nlaw courts, where, however, the _bona fides_ of the divorce which she\r\nwas alleged to have made was questioned.[320] In spite of some coldness\r\nbetween them in later years, and the physical infirmities which removed\r\nhim from public business, Augustus sincerely mourned his loss, as of a\r\ncounsellor who never betrayed his confidence or spoke idle words. He had\r\nno real successor. From the time of his death the Emperor seems more and\r\nmore to have become his own prime minister, or to have looked to his own\r\nfamily for assistance as well as for a successor. Tacitus (_Ann._ 3, 30)\r\nsays that his place was taken by Sallustius Crispus, great-nephew of\r\nthe historian; but Augustus does not seem to have thought highly of his\r\nability, and the part he took in affairs was not prominent enough to have\r\nsecured mention by either Suetonius or Dio. M\xc3\xa6cenas wrote himself both\r\nin prose and verse, but in an affected and obscure style, which Augustus\r\nplayfully ridiculed. The stoic Seneca is particularly severe on a poem\r\nin which he declares that he clings to life in spite of all physical\r\nsufferings however painful:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThough racked with gout in hand and foot,\r\n    Though cancer deep should strike its root,\r\n    Though palsy shake my feeble thighs,\r\n    Though hideous hump on shoulders rise,\r\n    From flaccid gum teeth drop away;\r\n    Yet all is well if life but stay.\r\n    Give me but life, and e\xe2\x80\x99en the pain\r\n    Of sharpest cross shall count as gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Augustus and the poets.]\r\n\r\nThe chief writers of the M\xc3\xa6cenas circle, who either became intimate\r\nwith Augustus himself, or were induced by M\xc3\xa6cenas to join in the chorus\r\nof praise, were Vergil, Varius, Horace, Propertius. Of the epics of L.\r\nVarius Rufus (_circ._ B.C. 64-14) on Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar and Augustus, we have\r\nonly a few fragments. The historian, Livy, (B.C. 59-A.D. 16) was also on\r\nfriendly terms with Augustus, and seems to have had some hand in teaching\r\nClaudius, son of Drusus, the future emperor. But his great work\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nthe foundation of Rome to the death of Drusus (B.C. 9) was afterwards\r\nregarded as being too republican, and even Augustus used laughingly to\r\ncall him the Pompeian. It was the poets who made Augustus and his policy\r\nthe subject of their praises, and who employed their genius to support\r\nhis views.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vergil.]\r\n\r\nThe first to do this was P. Vergilius Maro (B.C. 70-17). The earliest\r\nof his writings, the _Eclogues_, composed between B.C. 42-37, do not\r\nshow any close connection with Augustus. The first indeed celebrates the\r\nrestoration of his farm after a personal interview with Octavian, on the\r\nsuggestion of Pollio and M\xc3\xa6cenas, and the poet declares that never will\r\nthere fade from his heart the gracious look of the young prince. But the\r\nchief object of praise in the _Eclogues_, so far as there is one, is\r\nPollio, who had been left in charge of the distribution of lands by the\r\nTriumvirs in B.C. 42. In the _Georgics_, however, finished after B.C. 30,\r\nwe find that he has fallen in with the new _r\xc3\xa9gime_. They are dedicated\r\nto the minister M\xc3\xa6cenas, they celebrate Augustus\xe2\x80\x99s triple triumph of\r\nB.C. 29, and they were composed partly, at any rate, at the wish of\r\nM\xc3\xa6cenas, who with Augustus was anxious to make country life and pursuits\r\nseem desirable. No doubt the theme itself was congenial to Vergil, who\r\npreferred a country life at Nola, or near Tarentum, to the bustle of\r\nRome; but it also happened to chime in with the views of Augustus, who\r\nall his life believed in the influence of literature and wished to have\r\nthe poets on his side. Accordingly, soon after his return from the East\r\nin B.C. 29 he seems to have suggested to Vergil to compose a poem that\r\nwould inspire men with a feeling of national pride and an enthusiasm\r\nfor the greatness of Rome\xe2\x80\x99s mission. The plan and form were no doubt\r\nwholly Vergil\xe2\x80\x99s, but the spirit and purpose, like those of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\npatriotic odes of about the same time, were those which the Emperor\r\ndesired. He was not satisfied with mere suggestion, he was eager for\r\nthe appearance of the poem. While in Gaul and Spain from B.C. 27-24 he\r\nfrequently wrote to the poet urging the completion of the work. A part of\r\none of Vergil\xe2\x80\x99s answers has been preserved:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to my \xc3\x86neas, upon my honour if I had anything written worth your\r\nlistening to, I would gladly send it. But the subject thus begun is so\r\nvast, that I almost think I must have been beside myself when I undertook\r\na work of this magnitude; especially considering that\xe2\x80\x94as you are aware\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam also devoting part of my time to different and much more important\r\nstudies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe _\xc3\x86neid_ was thus undertaken at the solicitation of Augustus. The\r\nlegend on which it turns\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a late one\xe2\x80\x94of the landing of \xc3\x86neas\r\nin Italy and the foundation of Rome by his descendant, is with great\r\nskill interwoven with a fanciful descent of the _gens Iulia_ from his\r\nson Iulus, to magnify Rome and her divine mission, and at the same\r\ntime to point to Augustus as the man of destiny, and as representing\r\nin his own person and career the majesty of the Roman people. In such\r\na poem detailed allusions cannot be expected as in the occasional odes\r\nof Horace. Yet, besides the fine passage in the eighth book describing\r\nthe victory of Actium and the discomfiture of Cleopatra, and that in\r\nthe sixth announcing the victorious career of Augustus, we have, more\r\nor less, direct references to the restoration of religious worship in\r\nthe _vici_, to the return of the standards by the Parthians, and the\r\ndeath of the young Marcellus. In form, the _\xc3\x86neid_ follows the model of\r\nHomer, the supreme epic. But in substance it is original, in that it\r\ndoes not take for its theme one of the old myths\xe2\x80\x94as the Alexandrine poets\r\nalways did\xe2\x80\x94but while teeming with all kinds of mythological allusions it\r\nfinds its chief inspiration in the greatness of Rome, measured by the\r\nelemental strife preceding the accomplishment of the divine purpose:\r\n_tant\xc3\xa6 molis erat Romanam condere gentem_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSo vast the task to found the\r\nRoman race,\xe2\x80\x9d is the keynote of the whole. It is original as the epic of\r\nMilton was original who, with details borrowed from every quarter, took\r\nfor his theme the foundation of a world and the strife in heaven that\r\npreceded it. Vergil\xe2\x80\x99s epic is Roman history on the highest plane, and has\r\ncrystallised for ever a view of that history which has done more than\r\narms and laws to commend it to the imagination of mankind. Augustus had a\r\ntrue intuition when he forbade the poet\xe2\x80\x99s executors to obey his will and\r\nburn the rolls containing this great national epic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Horace.]\r\n\r\nQ. HORATIUS FLACCUS (B.C. 65-B.C. 8) is not perhaps so great a poet as\r\nVergil, but he possessed the charm which keeps such work as his alive.\r\nHis connection with Augustus is a remarkable phenomenon in literary\r\nhistory. Having fought on the side of his enemies at Philippi, and having\r\nshared in the amnesty granted to the bulk of the troops, he returned home\r\nto find his paternal property confiscated. Poverty drove him to poetry,\r\npoetry gained him the friendship of Varius and Vergil, who introduced\r\nhim to M\xc3\xa6cenas, who saw his merit, relieved him from the uncongenial\r\nemployment of a clerk, and eventually introduced him to Augustus. The\r\nEmperor, in his turn, was not long in recognising his charm. He writes to\r\nM\xc3\xa6cenas:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn old times I was vigorous enough to write my friends\xe2\x80\x99 letters for\r\nthem. Nowadays being overwhelmed with business and weak in health, I am\r\nvery anxious to entice Horace away from you. He shall therefore quit your\r\ntable of parasites and come to my table of kings and assist me in writing\r\nletters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe refusal of Horace\xe2\x80\x94prudent no doubt in view of his tastes and\r\nhabits\xe2\x80\x94did not lose him the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s favour. He twice received\r\nsubstantial marks of it, and some extracts or letters to him from\r\nAugustus have been preserved which exhibit the latter in his most\r\ngracious mood:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider yourself a privileged person in my house, as though an habitual\r\nguest at my table. You will be quite within your rights and will always\r\nbe sure of a welcome; for it is my wish that our intimacy should be on\r\nthat footing if your state or health permits it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a warm recollection I retain of you, you will be able to learn from\r\nSeptimius among others, as I happened to be talking about you in his\r\npresence the other day. For you need not suppose, because you were so\r\nhigh and mighty as to reject my friendship, that I am on the high horse\r\ntoo to pay you back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAugustus, in fact, had a great opinion of Horace, and predicted his\r\nimmortality. He selected him to write the ode for the secular games,\r\npressed him later in life to immortalise the achievements of Tiberius and\r\nDrusus, and was desirous of his own name appearing as the recipient of\r\none of his Satires or Epistles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite angry, let me tell you, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t give me the preference\r\nas a person to address in your writings of that kind. Are you afraid\r\nthat an appearance of intimacy with me will damage your reputation with\r\nposterity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHorace made the Emperor a return in full for such condescension. How far\r\nthe genius of a poet is warmed or chilled by patronage it is not easy to\r\ndecide. So far as he is tempted away from his natural bent, or confined\r\nin the free expression of thought, he suffers: so far as he is saved\r\nfrom sordid cares, he is a gainer. Horace, in early youth, sympathised\r\nwith the republican party in whose ranks he had served, and probably in\r\nlater life still felt a theoretical preference for it, and could speak\r\nof the _nobile letum_ and _atrox animus_ of Cato with a true note of\r\nadmiration, But he was a man of his time. The policy of Octavian had made\r\nthe supremacy of Augustus inevitable, and it at least secured peace and\r\nsafety. The patronage and liberality of M\xc3\xa6cenas assuredly helped to turn\r\nthe scale, but I see no reason to doubt that the poet was convinced,\r\nthough, perhaps, without enthusiasm, that the new _r\xc3\xa9gime_ was one to\r\nbe supported by reasonable men. The kindness of the Emperor naturally\r\nenhanced the effect of his commanding personality, but it would be\r\ndifficult for a poet so placed to write with greater dignity and less\r\nfulsomeness than Horace does in the first epistle of the second book,\r\naddressed to Augustus at his own request. But it is in the _Odes_ that we\r\nmust trace the unbroken sympathy with the career and policy of Augustus.\r\nIf they are closely examined, with an eye to chronological arrangement,\r\nthe ingenuity with which these imitations of Greek models are framed to\r\nsupport and recommend the purposes or celebrate the successes of the\r\nEmperor, will stand revealed in a striking manner. The _Epodes_ and the\r\nfirst three books of the _Odes_ were apparently written between B.C. 35\r\nand B.C. 25. Dropped in among a number of poems of fancy, or passion, or\r\nmere literary _tours de force_, are compositions that follow not only the\r\nactual achievements of Augustus, but his ideals, his intentions, and his\r\naspirations, from the years just before Actium to his return from Spain\r\nin B.C. 25. We begin with the Second Epode, which refers with regret to\r\nthe abandoned intention of invading Britain in B.C. 35, and expresses\r\nhis alarm at the prospect of a renewed civil war. In the Sixteenth Epode\r\nthis terror has become a reality; the civil war has begun, and the poet,\r\nforeseeing the downfall of the state, turns longing eyes to the peace and\r\ncalm of the fabled islands of the West. From Italy and all its horrors\r\nthey must at any rate depart. In the Ninth Epode the relief has come; the\r\nshameful servitude of a Roman imperator and Roman soldiers to a foreign\r\nqueen is over; Antony and Cleopatra are in full flight (B.C. 31). In\r\nanother year it is known that Antony has fallen by his own hand, and that\r\nCleopatra has saved herself the indignity of the triumphal procession by\r\nthe adder\xe2\x80\x99s aid (_Od._ i. 39). The discharge of the legions follows, and\r\ntheir settlement in Italian and Sicilian lands (2 _Sat._, 6, 54). In the\r\nother odes of the first book the devotion to Augustus proceeds apace.\r\nThe Iulian star is in the ascendant (1, 2, 20); Augustus is _pater_\r\nand _princeps_, anticipating the future titles (1, 2, 20); he is again\r\ncontemplating the invasion of Britain (1, 35, 29); the Arabian expedition\r\nis being planned with all its futile hopes of wealth (1, 29; 1, 35). In\r\nthe second book of the _Odes_, beginning with reflections on the evils\r\nof civil war (2, 1), the poet notices one after the other the triumphs\r\nof Augustus or his generals in B.C. 27-24. The Cantabrian war (2, 6, 2;\r\n2, 11, 1); the triumphal arch at Susa (2, 9, 19); the success of his\r\ndiplomacy in Scythia, Armenia, and Parthia (_ib._) In the third book the\r\nembassy of British chiefs is treated as though the island were annexed\r\n(3, 5, 2); the Cantabrians are regarded as conquered after the expedition\r\nof Augustus (3, 8, 22; 3, 14). Then succeeds a period of statesmanship\r\nand reform. The Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s Roman policy, and his determination to keep\r\nRome the centre of government, are warmly supported (3, 3); the moral\r\nevils, the extravagance and debauchery of the age must be cured, and\r\nHorace proceeds to support the abortive legislation of B.C. 27, and to\r\nforeshadow the censorial acts, and the legislation of B.C. 18. There\r\nis a protest against the magnificence and extent of country houses (2,\r\n15); against the effeminacy of youth (iii. 2); against the immorality\r\nof women and the licentiousness that led to civil strife (3, 24). The\r\n_Carmen s\xc3\xa6culare_ speaks of the legislation as effected, and foretells\r\nits success (20); while in the fourth book he asserts that, at any rate\r\nwhile Augustus is with them, that success has been secured (4, 5), and\r\nthat he has not only given them peace, but a great moral reform (4, 15).\r\nThe policy of the Emperor in regard to the bugbear of the East, the\r\nParthian power, is also followed step by step. They are the dangerous\r\nenemy whose subjection will make Augustus divine (3, 5, 1-4), and whose\r\nthreatened invasions keep his ministers in constant anxiety (3, 29, 27).\r\nThis is before B.C. 20; but in B.C. 19 they have made submission and\r\nrestored the standards and prisoners (_Epist._ i. 18, 56), and this is\r\none of the triumphs of Augustus that requires a master hand to record\r\n(_Epist._ ii. 1, 255); it is the glory of the Augustan age (_Od._ 4,\r\n15, 6), and as long as Augustus is safe, no one will fear them more (4,\r\n5, 25). Finally, at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s request, he celebrated the victories\r\nof Drusus and Tiberius over the Vindelici and Rh\xc3\xa6ti (4, 4 and 14), and\r\nespecially the defeat of the Sugambri who had routed Lollius (4, 2, 34;\r\n4, 14, 51), with a compliment to Augustus himself for having gone to\r\nGaul to support Tiberius and Drusus with reinforcements and advice (4,\r\n14, 33), and for having at length closed the door of Ianus (4, 15, 9).\r\nThe lyrical career of Horace, therefore, corresponds remarkably with the\r\nactivities of Augustus. His genius presented those activities to his\r\nfellow citizens (and Horace\xe2\x80\x99s verses were soon read in schools) exactly\r\nin the light in which the Emperor wished them to be viewed. If we lay\r\naside some expressions of overstrained compliment, which favoured the\r\ngrowing fashion of paying the Emperor divine honours, it cannot be said\r\nthat the language is fulsome or degrading to the poet. The \xe2\x80\x9cparasitic\r\ntable\xe2\x80\x9d of M\xc3\xa6cenas may, as M. Beul\xc3\xa9 asserts, have been a misfortune to\r\nthe poets, and attenuated their vein of inspiration: but a man must have\r\nsomething in practical life on which to pin his faith; and Horace might\r\nhave done worse than devote his genius to promote loyalty to the great\r\nstatesman who had saved Roman society and given peace and prosperity to\r\nan empire. Just as Vergil, if he had followed his own impulse, might have\r\nperhaps produced a fine poem on the Epicurean cosmogony, but not one that\r\nlives and breathes with the noble glow of patriotism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Propertius.]\r\n\r\nSextus Propertius (_circ._ B.C. 45-_circ._ B.C. 15) was another of the\r\nM\xc3\xa6cenas circle of poets who did something to glorify Augustus. He is\r\nnot (but that is a personal opinion) on anything like the same level as\r\neither Vergil or Horace as an artist. He is said to have died young,\r\nperhaps at thirty years of age, and there is no evidence of personal\r\nintimacy with Augustus, but there is some indication of his having been\r\non bad terms with Horace. His elegies also are nearly all poems of\r\npassion. Politics and emperors are mere episodes, and were introduced\r\nin deference to M\xc3\xa6cenas. Still many points in the career of Augustus\r\nare referred to in the same spirit as that of Horace. The siege of\r\nPerusia\xe2\x80\x94described in tones of horror, which would scarcely have been\r\nacceptable\xe2\x80\x94precedes his conversion (1, 21), and the failure of the\r\nmarriage law of B.C. 27 is only referred to with relief (2, 7, 1). In\r\nmore complimentary terms he speaks of the victory of Actium (3, 7, 44),\r\nand of the downfall of Antony and Cleopatra (4, 8, 56; 4, 10, 32, _sqq._;\r\n4, 7, 56); and the end of the civil wars is attributed to Augustus (_illa\r\nqua vicit condidit arma manu_, 3, 8, 41). Then came the intended invasion\r\nof Britain (3, 23, 5); the Arabian expedition and the Indian envoys (3,\r\n1, 15; 4, 3 1); the opening and description of the Palatine Library\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbest extant (3, 29); the raids of the Sugambri and their suppression (5,\r\n6, 77); while he has the Parthians frequently on his lips, though rather\r\nas predicting what is to be done with them than as recording the return\r\nof the standards.[321] In the fifth book there are signs of a beginning\r\nof a _Fasti_ like that of Ovid as a record of events in Roman history;\r\nand it is possible that this was in obedience to a wish of Augustus,\r\nwho, on his death, transferred the task to Ovid. Thus his voice also was\r\nsecured, in part at least, in support of the imperial _r\xc3\xa9gime_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ovid.]\r\n\r\nPublius Ovidius Naso (B.C. 43-A.D. 18) belongs to the last part of the\r\nreign. He had only seen Vergil, and though he had heard Horace recite,\r\nhe does not profess to have known him. He was quite young when Augustus\r\nwas winning his position and reforming the constitution, and there\r\nare no signs of his coming forward as a court poet till M\xc3\xa6cenas and\r\nhis circle had disappeared, and if he had attracted the attention of\r\nAugustus at all, it was probably not altogether in a favourable manner.\r\nHis earliest poems\xe2\x80\x94the _Amores_ and _Heroidum Epistul\xc3\xa6_\xe2\x80\x94do not touch\r\non public affairs; they are poems of passion\xe2\x80\x94the former personal, the\r\nlatter dramatic. In the _Ars Amatoria_ (about B.C. 2-A.D. 2) for the\r\nfirst time we detect the court poet from a complimentary allusion to the\r\napproaching mission of Gaius C\xc3\xa6sar to Syria and Armenia, with his title\r\nof _princeps iuventutis_ and that of Augustus as _pater patri\xc3\xa6_, as also\r\nto the _naumachia_ or representation of the battle of Salamis given by\r\nAugustus in the flooded _nemus C\xc3\xa6sarum_ in B.C. 2 (_A. A._, 1, 171-2).\r\nThe _Metamorphoses_ had been composed before his exile in A.D. 9, but\r\nafter the death of Augustus he apparently introduced the Epilogue (xv.\r\n745 _sq._) containing an eulogy on Tiberius, and on the now finished\r\ncareer of Augustus. It is the _Fasti_\xe2\x80\x94the Calendar of events in Roman\r\nhistory\xe2\x80\x94that probably was undertaken in obedience to a wish of the\r\nEmperor, and in which accordingly we find points in his career touched\r\nupon. It was dedicated to Germanicus, and contains an allusion to his\r\nown exile, and was therefore, partly at least, composed between B.C.\r\n2 and A.D. 10. His allusions to Augustus are not those of an intimate\r\nacquaintance, but of an admiring subject\xe2\x80\x94real or feigned. He mentions the\r\nbattle of Mutina (iv. 627); the bestowal of the title Augustus (i. 589);\r\nthe recovery of the standards from the Parthians as a triumph of the\r\nEmperor (vi. 467). He alludes to Augustus becoming Pontifex Maximus (iii.\r\n415); to the laurels on his palace front (iv. 957); to the demolition of\r\nthe house of Vedius Pollio as connected with the reforms and the laws\r\nof B.C. 18 (vi. 637); to the division of the city into _vici_, and the\r\nworship of the Lares Augusti (v. 145); to the Forum Augusti and the\r\ntemple of Mars dedicated in B.C. 2. (v. 551, _sqq._). Ovid afterwards\r\nprotested that his books had been read with pleasure by Augustus, and\r\nassumed to have some knowledge of the private chambers of the palace\r\n(Trist., 1, 5, 2; 2, 520), but there is nothing in the allusions to\r\nmatters which he knew that Augustus wished to have recorded that has the\r\nair of close or intimate relations. They are the conventional expressions\r\nof the outside, and perhaps humble, panegyrist, not those of a friend\r\nand supporter, like Horace. The abject expressions in the Tristia and\r\nthe letters from Pontus need not be taken into account. They are merely\r\nbids for a recall, and they often express in the crudest form the growing\r\nfashion of worshipping the Emperor or his genius. Perhaps the most\r\nsubtle of these appeals is that in which he explains why he had spent\r\nhis youth in writing frivolous poetry instead of celebrating the glories\r\nof the Emperor\xe2\x80\x94he was not a good enough poet, and would have dishonoured\r\na subject above his reach (Tr., ii. 335-340). This was using a weapon\r\nforged by the Emperor himself, who had always let it be known that he\r\ndisliked being the subject of inferior artists. The melancholy and\r\nfeebleness of these later poems of Ovid seem to bear a sort of analogy\r\nwith the cloud that descended on the later years of Augustus. Vergil and\r\nHorace have the freshness of the morning or the vigour of noon, Ovid the\r\ngathering sadness of the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS\xe2\x80\x99S ACCOUNT OF HIS REIGN (FROM THE INSCRIPTION IN THE TEMPLE OF\r\nROME AND AUGUSTUS AT ANGORA)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When I was nineteen I collected an army on my own account and at my\r\nown expense, by the help of which I restored the republic to liberty,\r\nwhich had been enslaved by the tyranny of a faction; for which services\r\nthe Senate, in complimentary decrees, added my name to the roll of\r\ntheir House in the consulship of Gaius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius [B.C.\r\n43], giving me at the same time consular precedence in voting; and gave\r\nme imperium. It ordered me as propr\xc3\xa6tor \xe2\x80\x9cto see along with the consuls\r\nthat the republic suffered no damage.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, in the same year, both\r\nconsuls having fallen, the people elected me consul and a triumvir for\r\nrevising the constitution.\r\n\r\n2. Those who killed my father I drove into exile, after a legal trial,\r\nin punishment of their crime, and afterwards when these same men rose in\r\narms against the republic I conquered them twice in a pitched battle.\r\n\r\n3. I had to undertake wars by land and sea, civil and foreign, all over\r\nthe world, and when victorious I spared surviving citizens. Those foreign\r\nnations, who could safely be pardoned, I preferred to preserve rather\r\nthan exterminate. About 500,000 Roman citizens took the military oath to\r\nme. Of these I settled out in colonies or sent back to their own towns,\r\nafter their terms of service were over, considerably more than 300,000;\r\nand to them all I assigned lands purchased by myself or money in lieu\r\nof lands. I captured 600 ships, not counting those below the rating of\r\ntriremes.\r\n\r\n4. I twice celebrated an ovation, three times curule triumphs, and was\r\ntwenty-one times greeted as imperator. Though the Senate afterwards voted\r\nme several triumphs I declined them. I frequently also deposited laurels\r\nin the Capitol after performing the vows which I had taken in each war.\r\nFor successful operations performed by myself or by my legates under\r\nmy auspices by land and sea, the Senate fifty-three times decreed a\r\nsupplication to the immortal gods. The number of days during which, in\r\naccordance with a decree of the Senate, supplication was offered amounted\r\nto 890. In my triumphs there were led before my chariot nine kings or\r\nsons of kings. I had been consul thirteen times at the writing of this,\r\nand am in the course of the thirty-seventh year of my tribunician power\r\n[A.D. 13-14].\r\n\r\n5. The Dictatorship offered me in my presence and absence by the\r\nSenate and people in the consulship of Marcus Marcellus and Lucius\r\nArruntius [B.C. 22] I declined to accept. I did not refuse at a time\r\nof very great scarcity of corn the commissionership of corn supply,\r\nwhich I administered in such a way that within a few days I freed the\r\nwhole people from fear and danger. The consulship\xe2\x80\x94either yearly or for\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94then offered to me I declined to accept.\r\n\r\n6. In the consulship of M. Vinicius and Q. Lucretius [B.C. 19], of P. and\r\nCn. Lentulus [B.C. 18], and of Paullus Fabius Maximus and Q. Tubero [B.C.\r\n11], when the Senate and people of Rome unanimously agreed that I should\r\nbe elected overseer of the laws and morals, with unlimited powers and\r\nwithout a colleague, I refused every office offered me which was contrary\r\nto the customs of our ancestors. But what the Senate at that time wished\r\nme to manage, I carried out in virtue of my tribunician power, and in\r\nthis office I five times received at my own request a colleague from the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n7. I was one of the triumvirate for the re-establishment of the\r\nconstitution for ten consecutive years. I have been _princeps senatus_ up\r\nto the day on which I write this for forty years. I am Pontifex Maximus,\r\nAugur, one of the fifteen commissioners for religion, one of the seven\r\nfor sacred feasts, an Arval brother, a _sodalis Titius_, a fetial.\r\n\r\n8. In my fifth consulship [B.C. 29] I increased the number of the\r\npatricians by order of people and Senate. I three times made up the roll\r\nof the Senate, and in my sixth consulship [B.C. 28] I took a census of\r\nthe people with M. Agrippa as my colleague. I performed the _lustrum_\r\nafter an interval of forty-one years; in which the number of Roman\r\ncitizens entered on the census roll was 4,063,000. A second time with\r\nconsular imperium I took the census by myself in the consulship of Gaius\r\nCensorinus and Gaius Asinius [B.C. 8], in which the number of Roman\r\ncitizens entered on the roll was 4,223,000. I took a third census with\r\nconsular imperium, my son Tiberius C\xc3\xa6sar acting as my colleague, in the\r\nconsulship of Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Appuleius [A.D. 14], in which\r\nthe number of Roman citizens entered on the census roll was 4,937,000. By\r\nnew laws passed I recalled numerous customs of our ancestors that were\r\nfalling into desuetude in our time, and myself set precedents in many\r\nparticulars for the imitation of posterity.\r\n\r\n9. The Senate decreed that vows should be offered for my health by\r\nconsuls and priests every fifth year. In fulfilment of these vows the\r\nfour chief colleges of priests or the consuls often gave games in my\r\nlifetime. Also individually and by townships the people at large always\r\noffered sacrifices at all the temples for my health.\r\n\r\n10. By a decree of the Senate my name was included in the ritual of the\r\nSalii; and it was ordained by a law that my person should be sacred and\r\nthat I should have the tribunician power for the term of my natural life.\r\nI refused to become Pontifex Maximus in succession to my colleague during\r\nhis life, though the people offered me that sacred office formerly held\r\nby my father. Some years later I accepted that sacred office on the death\r\nof the man who had availed himself of the civil disturbance to secure\r\nit; such a multitude flocking to my election from all parts of Italy as\r\nis never recorded to have come to Rome before, in the consulship of P.\r\nSulpicius and C. Valgius [6 March, B.C. 12].\r\n\r\n11. The Senate consecrated an altar to Fortuna Redux, near the temple\r\nof Honour and Virtue, by the Porta Capena, for my return, on which it\r\nordered the Vestal Virgins to offer a yearly sacrifice on the day on\r\nwhich in the consulship of Q. Lucretius and M. Vinicius [B.C. 19] I\r\nreturned to the city from Syria, and gave that day the name _Augustalia_\r\nfrom my cognomen [15 Dec.].\r\n\r\n12. By a decree of the Senate at the same time part of the pr\xc3\xa6tors and\r\ntribunes of the plebs, along with the consul Q. Lucretius and leading\r\nnobles, were despatched into Campania to meet me\xe2\x80\x94an honour that up to\r\nthis time has been decreed to no one else. When I returned to Rome from\r\nSpain and Gaul after successful operations in those provinces, in the\r\nconsulship of Tiberius Nero and Publius Quintilius [B.C. 13], the Senate\r\nvoted that an altar to Pax Augusta should be consecrated for my return on\r\nthe Campus Martius, upon which it ordered the magistrates and priests and\r\nVestal Virgins to offer an annual sacrifice [30 Jan.].\r\n\r\n13. Whereas the Ianus Quirinus, which our ancestors ordered to be closed\r\nwhen peace throughout the whole dominions of the Roman people by land and\r\nsea had been obtained by victories, is recorded to have been only twice\r\nshut before my birth since the foundation of the city, the Senate three\r\ntimes voted its closure during my principate.\r\n\r\n14. My sons Gaius and Lucius C\xc3\xa6sar, whom fortune snatched from me in\r\ntheir early manhood, in compliment to me, the Senate and Roman people\r\ndesignated consuls in their fifteenth year with a proviso that they\r\nshould enter on that office after an interval of five years. From the day\r\nof their assuming the _toga virilis_ the Senate decreed that they should\r\ntake part in public business. Moreover, the Roman equites in a body gave\r\neach of them the title of _Princeps Iuventutis_, and presented them with\r\nsilver shields and spears.\r\n\r\n15. To the Roman plebs I paid 300 sesterces per head in virtue of\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s will; and in my own name I gave 400 apiece in my fifth\r\nconsulship [B.C. 29] from the sale of spoils of war; and a second time\r\nin my tenth consulship [B.C. 24] out of my own private property I paid\r\na bounty of 400 sesterces per man, and in my eleventh consulship [B.C.\r\n23] I measured out twelve distributions of corn, having purchased the\r\ngrain from my own resources. In the twelfth year of my tribunician power\r\n[B.C. 11], I for the third time gave a bounty of 400 sesterces a head.\r\nThese largesses of mine affected never less than 50,200 persons. In\r\nthe eighteenth year of my tribunician power and my twelfth consulship\r\n[B.C. 5] I gave 320,000 of the urban plebs sixty denarii a head. In the\r\ncolonies of my soldiers, in my fifth consulship [B.C. 29] I gave from the\r\nsale of spoils of war 1,000 sesterces a head; and among such settlers\r\nthe number who received that triumphal largess amounted to about 120,000\r\nmen. In my thirteenth consulship [B.C. 2] I gave 60 denarii apiece to the\r\nplebeians then in receipt of public corn; they amounted to somewhat more\r\nthan 200,000 persons.\r\n\r\n16. The money for the lands, which in my fourth consulship [B.C. 30], and\r\nafterwards in the consulship of M. Crassus and Cn. Lentulus the augur\r\n[B.C. 14], I assigned to the soldiers, I paid to the municipal towns. The\r\namount was about 600,000,000 sesterces, which I paid for lands in Italy,\r\nand about 260,000,000 which I disbursed for lands in the provinces.\r\n\r\nI was the first and only one within the memory of my own generation to\r\ndo this of all who settled colonies in Italy and the provinces. And\r\nafterwards in the consulship of Tib. Nero and Cn. Piso [B.C. 7], and\r\nagain in the consulship of C. Antistius and D. L\xc3\xa6lius [B.C. 6], and of C.\r\nCalvisius and L. Pasienus [B.C. 4], and of L. Lentulus and M. Messalla\r\n[B.C. 3], and of L. Caninius and Q. Fabricius [B.C. 2], to the soldiers,\r\nwhom after their terms of service I sent back to their own towns, I paid\r\ngood service allowances in ready money; on which I expended 400,000,000\r\nsesterces as an act of grace.\r\n\r\n17. I four times subsidised the _\xc3\xa6rarium_ from my own money, the sums\r\nwhich I thus paid over to the commissioners of the treasury amounting\r\nto 150,000,000 sesterces. And in the consulship of M. Lepidus and L.\r\nArruntius [A.D. 6], to the military treasury, which was established on\r\nmy initiative for the payment of their good service allowance, to the\r\nsoldiers who had served twenty years or more, I contributed from my own\r\npatrimony 170,000,000 sesterces.[322]\r\n\r\n18. From and after the year of the consulship of Gn\xc3\xa6us and Publius\r\nLentulus [B.C. 18], whenever the payment of the revenues were in arrear,\r\nI paid into the treasury from my own patrimony the taxes, whether due in\r\ncorn or money, sometimes of 100,000 persons, sometimes of more.\r\n\r\n19. I built the curia and Chalcidicum adjoining it, and the temples of\r\nApollo on the Palatine with its colonnades, the temple of the divine\r\nIulius, the Lupercal, the colonnade at the Flaminian circus, which I\r\nallowed to be called Octavia, from the name of the builder of the earlier\r\none on the same site, the state box at the Circus Maximus, the temples\r\nof Jupiter Feretrius and of Jupiter Tonans on the Capitol, the temple of\r\nQuirinus, the temples of Minerva and of Juno the Queen, and of Jupiter\r\nLiberalis on the Aventine, the temple of the Lares at the head of the\r\n_via Sacra_, the temple of the divine Penates in the Velia, the temple of\r\nYouth, the temple of the Mater Magna on the Palatine.\r\n\r\n20. The Capitolium and the Pompeian theatre\xe2\x80\x94both very costly works\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nrestored without any inscription of my own name. Water-conduits in many\r\nplaces that were decaying from age I repaired; and I doubled the aqueduct\r\ncalled the Aqua Marcia, by turning a new spring into its channel.\r\n\r\nThe Forum Iulium and the basilica, which was between the temple of Castor\r\nand the temple of Saturn, works begun and far advanced by my father, I\r\ncompleted; and when the same basilica was destroyed by fire, I began its\r\nreconstruction on an extended plan, to be inscribed with the names of my\r\nsons, and in case I do not live to complete it I have ordered it to be\r\ncompleted by my heirs.\r\n\r\nIn my sixth consulship [B.C. 28], I repaired eighty-two temples of\r\nthe gods in the city in accordance with a decree of the Senate, none\r\nbeing omitted which at that time stood in need of repair. In my seventh\r\nconsulship [B.C. 27] I constructed the Flaminian road from the city to\r\nAriminum, and all the bridges except the Mulvian and Minucian.\r\n\r\n21. On ground belonging to myself I built a temple to Mars Ultor and\r\nthe Forum Augustum, with money arising from sale of war spoils. I built\r\na theatre adjoining the temple of Apollo, on ground for the most part\r\npurchased from private owners, to be under the name of my son-in-law\r\nMarcus Marcellus. Offerings from money raised by sale of war-spoil I\r\nconsecrated in the temple of Apollo, and in the temple of Vesta, and in\r\nthe temple of Mars Ultor, which cost me about 100,000,000 sesterces.\r\nThirty-five thousand pounds of gold,[323] crown money contributed by\r\nthe municipia and colonies of Italy for my triumphs, I refunded in my\r\nfifth consulship [B.C. 29], and subsequently, as often as I was greeted\r\nImperator, I refused to receive crown money, though the municipia and\r\ncolonies had decreed it with as much warmth as before.\r\n\r\n22. I three times gave a show of gladiators in my own name, and five\r\ntimes in the name of my sons and grandsons; in which shows about 10,000\r\nmen contended. I twice gave the people a show of athletes collected from\r\nall parts of the world in my own name, and a third time in the name of my\r\ngrandson. I gave games in my own name four times, as representing other\r\nmagistrates twenty-three times. In behalf of the quindecimviri, and as\r\nmaster of the college, with M. Agrippa as colleague, I gave the Secular\r\ngames in the consulship of C. Furnius and C. Silanus [B.C. 17]. In my\r\nthirteenth consulship [B.C. 2], I gave for the first time the games of\r\nMars which, since that time, the consuls have given in successive years.\r\nI gave the people wild-beast hunts, of African animals, in my own name\r\nand that of my sons and grandsons, in the circus and forum, and the\r\namphitheatres twenty-six times, in which about 3,500 animals were killed.\r\n\r\n23. I gave the people the spectacle of a naval battle on the other side\r\nof the Tiber, in the spot where now is the grove of the C\xc3\xa6sars, the\r\nground having been hollowed out to a length of 1,800 feet, and a breadth\r\nof 1,200 feet, in which thirty beaked ships, triremes or biremes, and\r\na still larger number of smaller vessels contended. In these fleets,\r\nbesides the rowers, there fought about three thousand men.\r\n\r\n24. In the temples of all the states of the province of Asia, I replaced\r\nthe ornaments after my victory, which he with whom I had fought had taken\r\ninto his private possession from the spoliation of the temples. There\r\nwere about eighty silver statues of me, some on foot, some equestrian,\r\nsome in chariots, in various parts of the city. These I removed, and from\r\nthe money thus obtained I placed golden offerings in the temple of Apollo\r\nin my own name and in that of those who had honoured me by the statues.\r\n\r\n25. I cleared the sea of pirates. In that war I captured about 30,000\r\nslaves, who had run away from their masters, and had borne arms against\r\nthe republic, and handed them back to their owners to be punished. The\r\nwhole of Italy took the oath to me spontaneously, and demanded that I\r\nshould be the leader in the war in which I won the victory off Actium.\r\nThe provinces of the Gauls, the Spains, Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, took\r\nthe same oath. Among those who fought under my standards were more than\r\nseven hundred Senators, eighty-three of whom had been, or have since\r\nbeen, consuls up to the time of my writing this, 170 members of the\r\nsacred colleges.\r\n\r\n26. I extended the frontiers of all the provinces of the Roman people,\r\nwhich were bordered by tribes that had not submitted to our Empire. The\r\nprovinces of the Gauls, and Spains and Germany, bounded by the Ocean from\r\nGades to the mouth of the river Elbe, I reduced to a peaceful state. The\r\nAlps, from the district near the Adriatic to the Tuscan sea, I forced to\r\nremain peaceful without waging unprovoked war with any tribe. My fleet\r\nsailed through the Ocean from the mouth of the Rhine towards the rising\r\nsun, up to the territories of the Cimbri, to which point no Roman had\r\npenetrated, up to that time, either by land or sea. The Cimbri, and\r\nCharydes, and Semnones and other peoples of the Germans, belonging to\r\nthe same tract of country, sent ambassadors to ask for the friendship\r\nof myself and the Roman people. By my command and under my auspices,\r\ntwo armies were marched into \xc3\x86thiopia and Arabia, called Felix, nearly\r\nsimultaneously, and large hostile forces of both these nations were cut\r\nto pieces in battle, and a large number of towns were captured. \xc3\x86thiopia\r\nwas penetrated as far as the town Nabata, next to Meroe. Into Arabia the\r\narmy advanced into the territories of the Sab\xc3\xa6i as far as the town Mariba.\r\n\r\n27. I added Egypt to the Empire of the Roman people. When I might have\r\nmade the Greater Armenia a province after the assassination of its king\r\nArtaxes, I preferred, on the precedent of our ancestors, to hand over\r\nthat kingdom to Tigranes, son of King Artavasdes, grandson of King\r\nTigranes, by the hands of Tiberius Nero, who was then my stepson. The\r\nsame nation being afterwards in a state of revolt and rebellion, I handed\r\nover to the government of King Ariobarzanes, son of Artabazus, king of\r\nthe Medes, after it had been reduced by my son Gaius; and after his death\r\nto his son Artavasdes, upon whose assassination I sent Tigranes, a member\r\nof the royal family of the Armenians, into that kingdom. I recovered all\r\nthe provinces on the other side of the Adriatic towards the East and\r\nCyren\xc3\xa6, which were by this time for the most part held by various kings,\r\nand before them Sicily and Sardinia which had been overrun by an army of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n28. I settled colonies of soldiers in Africa, Sicily, Macedonia, both\r\nthe Spains, Achaia, Asia, Syria, Gallia Narbonensis, Pisidia. Italy has\r\ntwenty-eight colonies established under my auspices, which have in my\r\nlifetime become very densely inhabited and places of great resort.\r\n\r\n29. A large number of military standards, which had been lost under other\r\ncommanders, I recovered, after defeating the enemy, from Spain and Gaul\r\nand the Dalmatians. I compelled the Parthians to restore the spoils and\r\nstandards of three Roman armies, and to seek as suppliants the friendship\r\nof the Roman people. These standards I laid up in the inner shrine\r\nbelonging to the temple of Mars Ultor.\r\n\r\n30. The tribes of the Pannonii, which before I was _princeps_ an army of\r\nthe Roman people never reached, having been subdued by Tiberius Nero,\r\nwho was then my stepson and legate [B.C. 11], I added to the Empire of\r\nthe Roman people, and I extended the frontier of Illyricum to the bank\r\nof the river Danube. And when an army of the Daci crossed to the south\r\nof that river it was conquered and put to flight under my auspices; and\r\nsubsequently my army, being led across the Danube, forced the tribes of\r\nthe Daci to submit to the orders of the Roman people.\r\n\r\n31. To me there were often sent embassies of kings from India, who had\r\nnever before been seen in the camp of any Roman general. By embassadors\r\nthe Bastarn\xc3\xa6 and the Scythians and the kings of the Sarmatians, who live\r\non both sides of the river Don, and the king of the Albani and of the\r\nHiberi and of the Medes, sought our friendship.\r\n\r\n32. Kings of the Parthians\xe2\x80\x94Tiridates, and afterwards Phrates, son of\r\nKing Phrates\xe2\x80\x94fled to me for refuge; of the Medes Artavasdes; of the\r\nAdiabeni Artaxares; of the Britons Dumnobellaunus and Tim ...;[324] of\r\nthe Marcomanni and Suebi....[324] Phrates, king of the Parthians, son of\r\nOrodes, sent all his sons and grandsons to me in Italy, not because he\r\nhad been overcome in war, but seeking our friendship by means of his own\r\nsons as pledges. And a very large number of other nations experienced the\r\ngood faith of the Roman people while I was _princeps_, with whom before\r\nthat time there had been no diplomatic or friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\n33. The nations of the Parthians and the chief men of the Medes by means\r\nof embassies sought and accepted from me kings of those peoples\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nParthians Vonones, son of King Phrates, grandson of King Orodes; the\r\nMedes Ariobarzanes, son of King Artavasdes, grandson of King Ariobarzanes.\r\n\r\n34. In my sixth and seventh consulships [B.C. 28, 27], when I had\r\nextinguished the flames of civil war, having by universal consent become\r\npossessed of the sole direction of affairs, I transferred the republic\r\nfrom my power to the will of the Senate and people of Rome. For which\r\ngood service on my part I was by decree of the Senate called by the name\r\nof Augustus, and the door-posts of my house were covered with laurels\r\nin the name of the state, and a civic crown was fixed up over my door,\r\nand a golden shield was placed in the Curia Iulia, which it was declared\r\nby its inscription the Senate and people of Rome gave me in recognition\r\nof valour, clemency, justice, piety. After that time I took precedence\r\nof all in rank, but of power I had nothing more than those who were my\r\ncolleagues in the several magistracies.\r\n\r\n35. While I was administering my thirteenth consulship [B.C. 2], the\r\nSenate and equestrian order and the Roman people with one consent greeted\r\nme as FATHER OF MY COUNTRY, and decreed that it should be inscribed in\r\nthe vestibule of my house, and in the Senate house, and in the Forum\r\nAugustum, and under the chariot which was there placed in my honour in\r\naccordance with a senatorial decree.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote this I was in my seventy-sixth year [A.D. 13-14].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Ad capita bubula._ Lanciani (_Remains of Ancient Rome_, p. 139) says\r\nthat this was the name of a lane at the eastern corner of the Palatine.\r\nOthers have thought it to be the name of the house, as the _ad malum\r\nPunicum_ in which Domitian was born (Suet., _Dom._ 1). So later we hear\r\nof a house at Rome _qu\xc3\xa6 est ad Palmam_ (_Codex Theod._, p. 3). The house\r\nmay have had its name from a frieze with ox-heads on it, like the tomb of\r\nMetella, which came to be called _Capo-di-bove_. It seems less easy to\r\naccount for a lane being so called. See also p. 205.\r\n\r\n[2] C. I. L., vol. i. p. 279.\r\n\r\n[3] Cicero, _ad Q. Fr._ 1, 1, 21; 1, 2, 7. Velleius Pat., 2, 59; Sueton.,\r\n_Aug._ 3.\r\n\r\n[4] The plebeian Atii Balbi do not seem to have been important. M. Atius\r\nBalbus was pr\xc3\xa6tor in B.C. 62 (with C\xc3\xa6sar), governor of Sardinia B.C.\r\n61-60, and in B.C. 59 was one of the XX viri under the Julian land law\r\n(Cic., _ad Att._ ii. 4).\r\n\r\n[5] These and other stories will be found in Sueton., _Aug._ 94, and Dio,\r\n45, 2. Vergil makes skilful use of them in _\xc3\x86n._, vi. 797, _sqq._\r\n\r\n[6] Antony, when he wished to depreciate Augustus, asserted that his\r\ngreat-grandfather had a rope-walk at Thurii; and some such connection of\r\nhis ancestors with that place may account for the cognomen, which would\r\nnaturally be dropped afterwards (Suet., _Aug._ 7).\r\n\r\n[7] The marriage could not have taken place earlier than the middle of\r\nB.C. 57, for when Atia\xe2\x80\x99s first husband died Philippus was in Syria. He\r\nwas succeeded by Gabinius in B.C. 57, and reached Italy in time to stand\r\nfor the consulship, the elections that year being at the ordinary time,\r\n_i.e._, July (Cic., _ad Att._ 4, 2).\r\n\r\n[8] L. Marcius Philippus was the son of the famous orator, and was a warm\r\nsupporter of Cicero. With his colleague as consul-designate he proposed\r\nthe prosecution of Clodius (Cic., _ad Q. Fr._ ii. 1). When the civil\r\nwar was beginning he was allowed by C\xc3\xa6sar to remain neutral (Cic., _ad\r\nAtt._ ix. 15; x. 4). But Cicero found him tiresome company, for he was\r\ngarrulous and prosy (_ad Att._ xii. 9, 16, 18); and in the troublous\r\ntimes following the assassination of C\xc3\xa6sar he set little store by his\r\nopinion (_ad Att._ xvi. 14; _ad Brut._ i. 17).\r\n\r\n[9] The law of B.C. 52 allowed C\xc3\xa6sar to be \xe2\x80\x9celected in his absence\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(_absentis rationem haberi_), but said nothing of his being in possession\r\nof a province. By long prescription the Senate had the right of deciding\r\nwhen a provincial governor should be \xe2\x80\x9csucceeded.\xe2\x80\x9d But then C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s term\r\nof provincial government had been fixed by a _lex_, which was superior\r\nto a _Senatus-consultum_; and he might also argue that if it was\r\nunconstitutional for a man to be elected consul while holding a province,\r\nthe Senate had violated the constitution in allowing Pompey to be consul\r\nin B.C. 52.\r\n\r\n[10] The Senate did not insist on the _professio_, from which C\xc3\xa6sar had\r\nbeen exempted by name in Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s law. But its contention was that it\r\nstill retained the right of naming the date at which a man was to leave\r\nhis province, and of deciding in regard to an election whether a man was\r\na legal candidate, which might depend on other things besides the making\r\nor not making a _professio_.\r\n\r\n[11] The difficulty was that both consuls were absent. There was no\r\none therefore capable of holding a consular election. But as the other\r\ncurule magistrates still existed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe _auspicia_ had not returned to\r\nthe Fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d who could not therefore name an interrex. The Pr\xc3\xa6tor\r\nLepidus\xe2\x80\x94though willing\xe2\x80\x94could not \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d a _maius imperium_. The only\r\nway out of it was to name a Dictator (_com. hab. causa_); but one of\r\nthe consuls, according to tradition, could alone do that. Eventually\r\nLepidus, by a special vote of the people was authorised to name C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nas Dictator\xe2\x80\x94which had precedents in the cases of Fabius Maximus and\r\nSulla\xe2\x80\x94and C\xc3\xa6sar, as Dictator, held the consular elections. C\xc3\xa6s., b. c.\r\nii, 21; Dio, 41, 36.\r\n\r\n[12] Nicolas (ch. 4) says that he took the _toga virilis_ about fourteen\r\n(\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xe1\xbc\x94\xcf\x84\xce\xb7 \xce\xbc\xce\xac\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb1 \xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xbc\xcf\x82 \xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xcf\x83\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xaf\xce\xb4\xce\xb5\xce\xba\xce\xb1). But Suetonius (_Aug._ 8) says\r\nthat he spoke the _laudatio_ of his grandmother in his twelfth year, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfour years afterwards\xe2\x80\x9d took the _toga virilis_.\r\n\r\n[13] Octavius was _sui iuris_, his father being dead; his adoption\r\ntherefore required the formal passing of a _lex curiata_. Now the\r\nopposition, supported by Antony, against this formality being carried out\r\nwas one of the grounds of Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel with him in B.C. 44-3, and\r\nthe completion of it was one of the first things secured by Octavian on\r\nhis entrance into Rome in August, B.C. 43 [Appian, b. c. iii. 94; Dio,\r\n45, 5]. This seems conclusive against the theory that Iulius adopted\r\nhim in his lifetime. Moreover all authorities speak of the adoption as\r\nmade by _Will_. Livy, _Ep._ 116, _testamento in nomen adoptatus est_;\r\nVelleius, ii. 59, _testamentum apertum est, quo C. Octavium nepotem\r\nsororis su\xc3\xa6 Iuli\xc3\xa6 adoptabat_. See also Appian, b. c. iii. 11; Dio, 45, 3;\r\nPlutarch, _Brut._ 22. It is true that Nicolas\xe2\x80\x94speaking of the triumph of\r\nB.C. 46\xe2\x80\x94(\xc2\xa7 8) says \xcf\x85\xe1\xbc\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb8\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\xa4\xce\xb4\xce\xb7 \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xb7\xce\xbc\xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xcf\x82.

In making the Octavii patricians,\r\nthe initiative was taken by the Senate; in later times, however, the\r\npower of creating _patricii_ was conferred on the imperator. Iulius seems\r\nalso to have done it on his own authority. (Dio, 43, 47; Suet., _Aug._ 2.)\r\n\r\n[16] He took with him Apollodorus of Pergamus, a well-known author of a\r\nsystem of rhetoric (Suet., _Aug._ 89; Strabo, 13, 4, 3; Quinct., 3, 1,\r\n17). Other teachers of his, whether at Apollonia or elsewhere, are Areius\r\nof Alexandria, Alexander of Pergamus, Athenodorus of Tarsus (Suet. _l.\r\nc._; Dio, 51, 4; Plutarch, _Ant._ 11; Nicol.

He had taken it out of the hands of the _qu\xc3\xa6stors_ and\r\nappointed two _pr\xc3\xa6fecti_ to manage it: but it does not seem that they had\r\nanything to do with the money in the temple of Ops, as to which there was\r\nsome doubt as to its being \xe2\x80\x9cpublic money\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense.\r\n\r\n[83] Cicero, _1 Phil._ \xc2\xa7 17; _2 Phil._ \xc2\xa7 93.\r\n\r\n[84] Cicero, in _2 Phil._ \xc2\xa7 93, seems to assume that Antony had taken the\r\nmoney all at once. But from Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s own letters it would seem that the\r\nprocess of despoiling the temple of Ops was a gradual one, and that the\r\nuse made of the money by Antony was more or less a matter of conjecture.\r\nOn the 27th of April he writes: \xe2\x80\x9cYou mention plundering going on at the\r\ntemple of Ops. I, too, was a witness to that at the time\xe2\x80\x9d (_ad Att._\r\nxiv. 14). On the 7th of May he says that Dolabella had a great share\r\nof it (_ad Att._ xiv. 18). In November he says that his nephew Quintus\r\nknew all about it, and meant to reveal it to the public (_ad Att._ xvi.\r\n14). Appian (b. c. iii. 20) makes Antony say to Octavian: \xe2\x80\x9cThe money\r\ntransferred to my house was not so large a sum as you conjecture, nor is\r\nany part of it in my custody now.

He refused to accept a mere money\r\ncompensation. Eventually, when the Senate had broken with Antony, it made\r\nterms with Sextus, appointing him commander of the naval forces of the\r\nRepublic.

This was a general order,\r\nneither Antony nor any particular _hostis_ being named.\r\n\r\n[118] Octavian first assumed the _fasces_ (symbol of imperium) on the 7th\r\nof January (C. I. L. x. 8375.)\r\n\r\n[119] Cicero, _8 Phil._ \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 25-28.\r\n\r\n[120] The letter is preserved in the 13th Philippic, with Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbitter comments. It dwells on the favours and honours voted to the chief\r\nassassins, as well as the abolition of many of C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s _acta_. Antony\r\nalso asserts that Lepidus and Plancus are on his side and warns Octavian\r\nthat Cicero is playing him false.\r\n\r\n[121] The country is very flat, but was intersected by drains and\r\nwatercourses, making military evolutions difficult, if not impossible, in\r\nthe rainy season. (App., b. c. 3, 65.)\r\n\r\n[122] Such as the cavalry engagement between Pontius Aquila and Tib.\r\nMunatius Plancus at Pollentia (Dio, 46, 38). Octavian also suffered some\r\nloss by the desertion of some Gallic cavalry (_ib._ 37).\r\n\r\n[123] Cic., _ad Brutum_, ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[124] In enrolling legions Bassus was probably justified by the _SCtum\r\nultimum_, which included the pr\xc3\xa6tors. He was known to be a supporter of\r\nAntony, and might be thought capable of occupying Rome in his interest.\r\nWe shall see afterwards that he joined him in Cisalpine Gaul. Some rumour\r\nof his being likely to act in this way had been rife before January 1st,\r\nwhen he was only pr\xc3\xa6tor-designate. (See Cic., _ad Att._ xvi. 1; _ad\r\nBrut._ i. 3.)\r\n\r\n[125] Cicero says of Octavian that he _secundum proelium fecit_ because\r\nhe _castra multarum legionum paucis cohortibus tutatus est_ (_14 Phil._ \xc2\xa7\r\n28). The attack on the camp is not mentioned elsewhere (_ib._ \xc2\xa7 37). For\r\nhis being greeted as Imperator see C. I. L. ix. 8375.\r\n\r\n[126] Cic., _ad Brut._ 1, 3, 5.\r\n\r\n[127] Suet., _Aug._ 11; Cic., _ad Brut._ i. 6.\r\n\r\n[128] Cic., _ad Fam._ xi. 21.\r\n\r\n[129] Dio, 46, 41; Livy, _Ep._ 118.\r\n\r\n[130] Cic., _ad Brut._ i. 15.\r\n\r\n[131] _Id._, _ad Fam._ xi. 20, 21, see _ante_ p. 52.\r\n\r\n[132] _Id._, _ad Brut._ i. 4; App., b. c. iii. 82; Dio, 46, 42; Plut.,\r\n_Cic._ 46. There was evidently some rumour of Cicero intending to be\r\nconsul, though he speaks with rather affected indignation of Octavian\r\nwishing to be elected also (_ad Brut._ i. 10).\r\n\r\n[133] Cic., _ad Brut._ 1, 3.\r\n\r\n[134] _Id._ \xc2\xa7 4.\r\n\r\n[135] Cic., _ad Fam._ xi. 10.\r\n\r\n[136] He was perhaps deceived by the report that Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s legions had\r\ntaken an oath not to fight against any that had served under Iulius\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar. This applied to some men at present with Antony. But Dio implies\r\nthat the oath was at the secret instigation of Octavian himself (Dio, 46,\r\n42).\r\n\r\n[137] Cic., _ad Fam._ xi. 13.\r\n\r\n[138] _Id._ xi. 19.\r\n\r\n[139] _Id._ xi. 20.\r\n\r\n[140] _Id._ xi. 14.\r\n\r\n[141] Cic., _ad Fam._ x. 23.\r\n\r\n[142] _Id._ x. 24.\r\n\r\n[143] _Id._ xi. 12 and 14.\r\n\r\n[144] Cic., _ad Fam._ x. 16.\r\n\r\n[145] _Id._ x. 35; xii. 35.\r\n\r\n[146] _Id._ xi. 26, _cp._ xi. 13.\r\n\r\n[147] _Id._, _ad. Brut._ i. 10.\r\n\r\n[148] A similar technical difficulty had occurred in B.C. 49 (both\r\nconsuls being absent, and unwilling, of course, to name a dictator), and\r\nhad been got over by the nomination of a dictator by the pr\xc3\xa6tor under a\r\nspecial law. See p. 8; Cic., _ad Fam._ x. 26; _ad M. Brut._ i. 5.\r\n\r\n[149] Plancus (Cic., _ad Fam._ x. 29) expresses surprise that C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nwished to give up the glory of defeating Antony for the sake of \xe2\x80\x9ca two\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 consulship.\xe2\x80\x9d But this only shows that Plancus did not understand\r\nOctavian\xe2\x80\x99s object or policy.\r\n\r\n[150] Suet., _Aug._ 26; Dio, 46, 43; Plut., _Pomp._ 58. Appian (b. c. 3,\r\n82), without alluding to this scene, regards the application itself as\r\nthe result of a secret intrigue with Cicero, and Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation, if\r\nmade, may have been intended as encouraging and not sarcastic.\r\n\r\n[151] The number given by Appian (b. c. iii. 88). Octavian had five\r\nlegions when he went to Gaul: two raised in Campania of veterans, one of\r\n_tirones_, the Martia and Quarta (App., b. c. iii. 47). The other three\r\nmust have been made up from the armies of Pansa and Hirtius. None of\r\nthe veteran legions in these two armies would consent to follow Decimus\r\nBrutus (Cic., _ad Fam._ xi. 19).\r\n\r\n[152] Cic., _ad Brut._ 1, 18.\r\n\r\n[153] _Ib._ and App., b. c. iii. 90.\r\n\r\n[154] The panic had been increased by some damage done by his soldier on\r\nthe march to properties of known anti-C\xc3\xa6sareans.\r\n\r\n[155] Confiscation of property and the forbidding of \xe2\x80\x9cfire and water\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfollowed as a matter of course. One of the assassins\xe2\x80\x94P. Servilius\r\nCasca\xe2\x80\x94was tribune, and as such could not legally be condemned, but he\r\nvacated his tribuneship by flying from Rome and was condemned with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n[156] The Senate had nothing to do with this _qu\xc3\xa6stio_, which was\r\nestablished by a _lex_, but its attitude to Octavian amounted to a\r\ncondonation if not an active approval.\r\n\r\n[157] According to Appian (b. c. iii. 97), Pollio for some time declined\r\nto join Antony and Lepidus. He seems to have done so when their outlawry\r\nwas removed.\r\n\r\n[158] Decimus Brutus first tried to reach Ravenna, hoping to sail\r\nto Macedonia and join M. Brutus. Headed back by C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s advance, he\r\nrecrossed the Alps (being gradually deserted by his men) and trusted\r\nhimself to a Gaul, who had received favours from him of old. But his host\r\ncommunicated with Antony, and by his orders put him to death. There were\r\nother versions of his death. Perhaps neither Antony nor C\xc3\xa6sar cared to\r\nask questions so long as he was dead. (App., b. c. iii. 97-98; Dio, 46,\r\n53; Velleius Pat., ii. 64; Livy, _Ep._ 120.)\r\n\r\n[159] Plancus did not accompany Antony into Italy; he stayed in Gaul,\r\nbusying himself with the foundation of Lugdunum, and apparently\r\nsuppressing some movements in the Eastern Alps, for at the end of the\r\nyear coming home to enter on his consulship, he celebrated a triumph _ex\r\nRh\xc3\xa6tis_ [Inscrip. Neap., 4089; Fast. Capitol. 29 Dec. A. V. 711.] Pollio,\r\nwho had presently to assent to the proscription of his father-in-law, L.\r\nQuintius, was left in charge of Transpadane Gaul, to arrange for lands\r\nfor the veterans. It was in this business that he came across Vergil and\r\nhis farm.\r\n\r\n[160] Daughter of Fulvia by her first husband, P. Clodius.\r\n\r\n[161] Plut., _Ant._ 19; App., b. c. iv. 6; Dio, 46, 44.\r\n\r\n[162] The usual interval (_tres nundin\xc3\xa6_) for _promulgatio_ was dispensed\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n[163] Appian, b. c. iv. 5; Livy, _Ep._ 120. Of the 69 names given by\r\nAppian, he records the escape of 31. This tallies roughly with the\r\ndiscrepancy between his and Livy\xe2\x80\x99s reckoning.\r\n\r\n[164] Appian, b. c. iv. 36.\r\n\r\n[165] Suet., _Aug._ 27.\r\n\r\n[166] Dio, 47, 14.\r\n\r\n[167] _Id._ 47, 16-17.\r\n\r\n[168] App., b. c. 4, 34.\r\n\r\n[169] _Lassam crudelitatem_, Sen. _de Clem._ 1, 9, 2. The other opinions\r\nreferred to are Velleius, ii. 66; App., b. c. iv. 42, 45; Plut., _Ant._\r\n21; Dio, 47, 7; Sueton., _Aug._ 27. For Toranius, see Nic. Dam. 2.\r\n\r\n[170] Sueton., _Aug._ 61; Dio, 47, 17; [Tacit.] _de orat._ 29.\r\n\r\n[171] Cicero, _13 Phil._ \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8-12, 50; Velleius, ii. 73. The decree was\r\npassed on the 20th of March, B.C. 43.\r\n\r\n[172] Dio, 48, 17 _sq._; Livy, _Ep._ 123.\r\n\r\n[173] App., b. c. iv. 85; Dio, 47, 36; Livy, _Ep._ 123.\r\n\r\n[174] Dio, 51, 2; Suet., _Aug._ 13.\r\n\r\n[175] At any rate the head never reached Rome, but was lost at sea. App.,\r\nb. c. iv. 135; Dio, 47, 49; Plut., _Ant._, 22; _Brut._ 53; Sueton.,\r\n_Aug._ 13.\r\n\r\n[176] Ulpian (dig. 48, 24) quotes this lost autobiography; see _Mon.\r\nAncyr._ \xc2\xa7 3.\r\n\r\n[177] The first meeting of Antony and Cleopatra, when the queen was rowed\r\nup the Cydnus in her barge, dressed as Venus with attendant cupids, seems\r\nto have been in the autumn of B.C. 42 (Plut., _Anton._ 25-6.). He had\r\nseen her once before in B.C. 56 when he accompanied Gabinius to restore\r\nher father. But she must have been a mere child then.\r\n\r\n[178] These legions had behaved badly at Placentia, demanding a sum of\r\nmoney from the inhabitants. Calenus and Ventidius may have justified\r\ntheir action on this score (Dio, 48, 10).\r\n\r\n[179] From _caliga_, \xe2\x80\x9ca soldier\xe2\x80\x99s boot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[180] Dio, 48, 12.\r\n\r\n[181] Appian, b. c. 4, 30; Dio, 48, 31. Livy, however (_Ep._ 121), says\r\n_M. Lepido fuso_, as though he had resisted and had been beaten.\r\n\r\n[182] Livy, _Ep._ 126; Velleius, ii. 74; App., b. c. v. 48-49; Dio, 48,\r\n14; Seneca, _de Clem._ 1, 11, 1. The uncertainty of historical testimony\r\nis illustrated by the fact that both Dio and Appian name C. Canutius (Tr.\r\nPl. B.C. 44) among the victims at Perusia, while Velleius (ii. 64) says\r\nthat he was the first to suffer under the proscription in B.C. 43.\r\n\r\n[183] C. I. L., i. 697.\r\n\r\n[184] This was to safeguard Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus. There is some\r\ndoubt, however, as to his having been an assassin. Cocceius denied it\r\n(App., b. c. v. 62). Suetonius (Nero 3) does the same. But Cicero (_2\r\nPhil._ \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 27, 30) says that he was; and Appian himself does the same (b.\r\nc. v. 59). Dio thrice speaks of him as a \xcf\x83\xcf\x86\xce\xb1\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xcf\x8d\xcf\x82 (48, 7, 29, 54). At\r\nany rate he was condemned by the _lex Pedia_, as though he had been an\r\nassassin. He may have been one of those who joined the assassins on the\r\nCapitol _after_ the murder.\r\n\r\n[185] Appian, b. c. v. 65. It has been doubted whether this or the\r\nmeeting of B.C. 37 was the one to which Horace accompanied his patron\r\nM\xc3\xa6cenas. In favour of this one is the mention of Cocceius Nerva by Horace\r\n(_Sat._ 1 v. 28, 50), against it is the way in which he is mentioned\r\nwith M\xc3\xa6cenas as aversos _soliti_ componere amicos, as if he had been so\r\nengaged before. But though in the second meeting he is not mentioned by\r\nAppian, he may have been there. Something has been made of the mention\r\nof the croaking frogs (l. 14), as this meeting could hardly have been\r\nearlier than July, when the Italian frogs are said to be silent. For the\r\nOvations see C. I. L., i. p. 461.\r\n\r\n[186] This was one of the chief grievances. Hor., _Ep._ ix. 9, _minatus\r\nurbi vincla, que detraxerat servis amicus perfidis_.\r\n\r\n[187] Hor., _Od._ ii. 1, 15-16; Dio, 48, 41; C. I. L., i. p. 461. Pollio\r\nafter this withdrew from active political life and devoted himself to\r\nliterature. He seems to have taken no part in the subsequent quarrels\r\nbetween Antony and Augustus.\r\n\r\n[188] Dio, 48, 19, 48; Hor., _Epod._ 9, 17.\r\n\r\n[189] The first period ended on the last day of B.C. 38; but neither\r\nAntony nor C\xc3\xa6sar had laid down their imperium of office. They now assumed\r\nthat it went on from the first day of B.C. 37, the want of legal sanction\r\nduring the intervening months being ignored. There is no certain trace of\r\nthis second triumvirate having been confirmed by a _lex_; yet one would\r\nthink that they would have taken care to have that formality observed.\r\nSee p. 143.\r\n\r\n[190] Cicero, _ad Fam._ xi. 9; Cicero himself calls him _levissimus_, _ad\r\nBrut._ 1, 15, \xc2\xa7 9.\r\n\r\n[191] In B.C. 52 Cicero had wished to give his daughter Tullia in\r\nmarriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero (Cic., _Att._ 6, 6.).\r\n\r\n[192] He was qu\xc3\xa6stor in B.C. 48, and therefore was not born later than\r\nB.C. 78. Livia was born B.C. 58.\r\n\r\n[193] Even Suetonius, not much inclined to speak good of Augustus, admits\r\nthat he _dilexit et probavit unice ac perseveranter_.\r\n\r\n[194] Suetonius (c. 22) says that he had two ovations\xe2\x80\x94after Philippi and\r\nafter the bellum Siculum. But if an ovation was decreed after Philippi,\r\nit was not celebrated till B.C. 40, upon the reconciliation with Antony.\r\nThe second was this. Another had been voted in B.C. 43 after Mutina, but\r\nnot celebrated (C. I. L. i. p. 461). See also p. 100.\r\n\r\n[195] Appian (b. c. v. 132) says that they elected him perpetual tribune\r\n(\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8\xce\xbd ... \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\x95\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xbf \xce\xb4\xce\xae\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xaf). Dio (49, 15) only says that they\r\ngave him the personal sacredness of the tribunes and the right of sitting\r\non their bench. Orosius (6, 18, 34) says that the Senate voted _ut in\r\nperpetuum tribunici\xc3\xa6 potestatis esset_. We shall have to discuss this\r\nlater on, but it must be said at once that Augustus was never tribune,\r\nand that it seems doubtful whether the _tribunicia potestas_ was given in\r\nits full sense at this time.\r\n\r\n[196] Dio, 49, 14; Strabo, x. 4, 9.\r\n\r\n[197] Dio, 49, 34.\r\n\r\n[198] App., b. c. v. 132; Suet., _Aug._ 32.\r\n\r\n[199] Or, as they were also called Vetus, and Nova Africa.

After Actium, when C\xc3\xa6sar\r\nlanded (the time and place are charmingly vague), a man offered a\r\n_cornix_ which had been taught to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAve, C\xc3\xa6sar, imperator et victor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe bought the bird at a large price, whereat the man\xe2\x80\x99s partner, being\r\njealous, urged that he should be forced to bring another bird, which\r\nwhen brought repeated as it had been taught, \xe2\x80\x9c_Ave, Antoni, imperator et\r\nvictor_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[207] Dio, 50, 5; but Suetonius, _Aug._ 17, says that he was declared a\r\n_hostis_.\r\n\r\n[208] Dio, 50, 5.

Livy (as we have him) says\r\nnothing either way except that she died by suicide (_Ep._ 133).

Into the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s _fisc_\r\nwent the revenues of the imperial provinces; but the balance in the case\r\nof most was not large. Cicero indeed (_pro lege Manil_, \xc2\xa7 14) says that\r\nnone of the provinces except Asia did much more than pay its expenses.\r\nThis was probably an exaggeration, but not a very great one.\r\n\r\n[215] This, it should be remembered, was exclusive of the legions\r\nregularly raised for certain provinces and stationed in them.\r\n\r\n[216] _Mon.

Still more exaggerated language was used afterwards on the\r\nrestoration of the standards (B.C. 20).\r\n\r\n[222] A good deal of confusion in our authorities has arisen by a\r\nfailure to distinguish between a _censoria potestas_ granted like the\r\n_tribunicia_ by special vote and the _censoria potestas_ inherent in\r\nthe consulship, from which it had been devolved in B.C. 444. In the\r\n_Monumentum_, ch. 8, Augustus himself says nothing about the _censoria\r\npotestas_, but in the Venusian fasti (C. I. L. ix. 422) we find _imp.\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar vi. M. Agrippa II. Cos. idem censoria potestate lustrum fecerunt_.\r\nSuetonius (c. 27) knew that he was not Censor, but supposed him to have\r\nacted under a decree granting him _morum legumque regimen perpetuum_, an\r\noffice, however, which Augustus expressly says that he declined (_Mon._,\r\nch. 6). Dio (52, 42) describes him as \xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb7\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x8d\xcf\x83\xce\xb1\xcf\x82 \xcf\x83\xe1\xbd\xba\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\xb7 \xe1\xbc\x88\xce\xb3\xcf\x81\xce\xaf\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xe1\xbe\xb3, a direct\r\nconfusion between the censorial power possessed by a Consul and that\r\nbestowed independently. He, however, apparently did receive _censoria\r\npotestas_ (never the censorship) in B.C. 19 for five years.\r\n\r\n[223] _Rex sacrorum_, the greater _flamens_, the Salii had still to be\r\npatricians. An _interrex_ also must be a patrician, but that office was\r\nnow practically at an end. The last case of an _interrex_ was in B.C. 52.\r\n\r\n[224] A jest that was reproduced in London when country peers came up to\r\nvote against the Home Rule Bill and were said by gossips to be obliged to\r\nask their way to the House of Lords. A popular ballad also was sung about\r\nthe streets\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cC\xc3\xa6sar leads the Gauls in triumph and guides them to the Senate house;\r\n    Gauls have doffed their native brogues and donned the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      laticlave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSueton., _C\xc3\xa6s._ 72, 80.

Ventidius Bassus, brought a prisoner from Asculum to adorn\r\nthe triumph of Pompey after the Social war, then a mule contractor to\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, and afterwards going through all the offices to the consulship in\r\nB.C. 43.\r\n\r\n[225] On the analogy of slaves enfranchised by will. Suet., _Aug._ 35;\r\nPlutarch, _Ant._ 15.\r\n\r\n[226] Cicero calls such a man a _voluntarius Senator_, 13 _Phil._ \xc2\xa7 28.\r\n\r\n[227] Dio, 48, 34.\r\n\r\n[228] Suet., _Aug._ 35; Dio, 52, 42. In the _Monumentum_ (c. 25) he\r\nreckons the number of Senators who had served under him as \xe2\x80\x9cmore than\r\n700.\xe2\x80\x9d To them must be added those who had not taken active service and\r\nthose who were with Antony.\r\n\r\n[229] Dio, 52, 42. The regulation had always existed because every\r\nSenator was bound to attend if called upon, and therefore must be within\r\nreach, unless he was one of those _qui reipublic\xc3\xa6 causa abessent_. (Livy,\r\n43, 11.) Thus Cicero, defending the Senators who crossed over to join\r\nPompey in Epirus, says to Atticus (viii. 15) that there was hardly one\r\nwho had not a legal right to cross, either as having imperium, or being\r\nlegatus to an imperator. The usual means of evading this was to obtain\r\na _libera legatio_ for a fixed time. Occasionally a man got himself\r\nnamed an ordinary legatus to a provincial governor, but was allowed to\r\ngo elsewhere with some colourable commission. But this was an abuse. See\r\nCicero, _ad Fam._ xii. 21; _ad Q. Frat._ ii. 9; _ad Att._ xv. 11. Sicily\r\nand Gallia Narbonensis were excepted as being practically Italy, or, as\r\nCicero says, \xe2\x80\x9csuburban provinces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[230] Sueton., _Aug._ 36; Dio, 3, 19; Tacitus, _Ann._ 5, 4.\r\n\r\n[231] \xe1\xbd\x85\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb4\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x95\xce\xba\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xce\xbd \xe1\xbd\x91\xcf\x80\xce\xac\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xce\xbd \xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\x91\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6 \xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x83\xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xce\xaf\xcf\x82. Dio, 53, 2. See Tacitus,\r\n_Ann._ iii. 28.\r\n\r\n[232] The doubt was an old one. Appian in one place affirms and in\r\nanother denies that there was a _lex_ for the second period of the\r\ntriumvirs (_Illyr._ 28; b. c. v. 95). No other authority mentions one,\r\nand it certainly was not passed in the early months of B.C. 37, that is,\r\ntill after the triumvirs had already continued their office without legal\r\nconfirmation for some time. Willems (_le S\xc3\xa9nat_, ii. 761) holds that\r\nthere was a plebiscitum; Mommsen that there was not.\r\n\r\n[233] _Mon. Ancyr._ ch. 34.\r\n\r\n[234] In B.C. 28 he took care to transfer the consular fasces to his\r\ncolleague Agrippa in alternative months, and when with soldiers to give\r\nthe watchword jointly with him. (Dio, 53, 1.)\r\n\r\n[235] I do not myself see any good reason to doubt that Dio has given at\r\nany rate the substance of these documents. It is not perhaps natural to\r\nus to suppose two men like M\xc3\xa6cenas and Agrippa solemnly reading speeches\r\nto the Emperor; but it was no unusual thing at Rome. Augustus himself is\r\nsaid to have done it, even to his wife, Livia, and frequently with others\r\n(Sueton., _Aug._ 84). Tacitus says it was the fashion of the time (_Ann._\r\n4, 37), as it seems to have been still earlier, for Cicero complains that\r\nhis nephew, Quintus, had written an elaborate diatribe against him which\r\nhe meant to deliver to Iulius C\xc3\xa6sar in Alexandria. (_Ad Att._ xi. 10.)\r\nFor similar documents see Dio, 52, 1-40; 53, 3; 55, 15-21.\r\n\r\n[236] Dio, 52, 15.\r\n\r\n[237] The IMPERIAL provinces were: Hispania Tarraconensis, and Lusitania,\r\nthe Galli\xc3\xa6 (beyond the Alps), including the districts afterwards called\r\nGermania, superior and inferior, C\xc5\x93le-Syria, Ph\xc5\x93nicia, Cilicia, Cyprus,\r\n\xc3\x86gypt.\r\n\r\nThe SENATORIAL were: Sicilia, Hispania B\xc3\xa6tica, Sardinia, Africa, Numidia,\r\nDalmatia, Greece and Epirus, Macedonia, Asia, Crete and Cyrene, Bithynia\r\nand Pontus.\r\n\r\nCisalpine Gaul ceased to be a province, and was included in Italy.\r\n\r\nSubsequent changes were:\r\n\r\n    B.C. 24. Cyprus and Gallia Narbonensis were transferred to the\r\n    Senate.\r\n\r\n    B.C. 21. Dalmatia was transferred to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    B.C. 6. Sardinia was transferred to the Emperor for nine years.\r\n\r\nThe provinces added during the lifetime of Augustus: Galatia, Lycaonia,\r\nM\xc5\x93sia, and the minor Alpine provinces were imperial.\r\n\r\nAll provinces added afterwards were imperial.\r\n\r\n[238] Ovid (F. 1, 587-616) says the Ides of January; the Calendarium\r\nPr\xc3\xa6nestinum gives the 16th. Possibly the one is the date of the SCtum,\r\nthe other of the plebiscitum.\r\n\r\n[239] Augustus himself uses it in the _Monumentum_ (chs. 30, 32), \xe2\x80\x9cme\r\nprincipe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cante me principem.\xe2\x80\x9d Horace (_Od._ 1, 21, 13; 2, 30; _Ep._ 2,\r\n1, 256), Propertius (v. 6, 46), both employ it when speaking of Augustus.\r\nIt occurs in inscriptions referring to Tiberius, and is the common term\r\nused by Tacitus. If, therefore, it was not formally bestowed (as seems\r\nprobable), it soon grew into use as a title in ordinary language. Nor\r\nwas it altogether a new idea; Cicero had used it as a possible title of\r\nhonour, with which Pompey or C\xc3\xa6sar, had they been moderate, might have\r\nbeen content. (Cic., _ad Fam._ vi. 6). Again, though it is not a mere\r\nextension of _princeps senatus_, yet it is clearly connected with it.\r\nAs the Senatus is the first _ordo_ in the state, the _princeps senatus_\r\nis also _princeps civitatis_. The two titles were soon confounded. Thus\r\nPliny (_N.H._ xxxvi. \xc2\xa7 116) speaks of M. \xc3\x86milius Scaurus as _totius\r\nprinceps civitatis_, when he means that he had been several times entered\r\nby the Censors on the roll as _princeps senatus_. But a new connotation\r\nbecame attached to the word from the political powers of the _princeps_.\r\n\r\n[240] Horace, _Epode_, vii. 7; _Odes_, i. 21, 15; iii. 5, 2; Propert.,\r\niii. 23, 5.\r\n\r\n[241] Vergil, _Georg._ iii. 25; Horace, _Odes_ iii. 4, 33.\r\n\r\n[242] Strabo, ii. 5, 8; iv. 6, 4.\r\n\r\n[243] Strabo, _l. c._ In the _Monument_. (ch. 32) Augustus records the\r\nvisit of two British princes, Dumnobellaunus and another, of whose name\r\nonly the letters _Tinn_ remain (perhaps \xe2\x80\x9cTincommius,\xe2\x80\x9d a king of what is\r\nnow Sussex).\r\n\r\n[244] The triumph of M. Crassus is dated by the Tab. Triumph. C. I. L. 1,\r\n416; but the defeat of the \xe2\x80\x9cDacian Cotiso\xe2\x80\x9d is classed with the Cantabrian\r\nwar by Horace (_Od._ 3, 8, 18-24), and Livy, _Ep._ 135, mentions a second\r\nwar of M. Crassus \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the Thracians,\xe2\x80\x9d as contemporary with the\r\nSpanish war.\r\n\r\n[245] The Salassi, who had for the last 100 years given much trouble, had\r\ntwice in recent years been in arms: in B.C. 35 they defeated C. Antistius\r\nVetus, and, in B.C. 34, had, with great difficulty, been partly subdued\r\nby Valerius Messalla. Their command of the principal Alpine pass made it\r\nimportant that they should be kept in check.\r\n\r\n[246] Hor., _Od._ 2, 6, 2, _Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre nostra_.\r\n\r\n[247] _Odes_ iii. 8, 21, _servit Hispan\xc3\xa6 vetus hostis or\xc3\xa6 Cantaber sera\r\ndomitus catena_; iii. 14, 3, _C\xc3\xa6sar Hispana repetit Penates Victor ab\r\nora_.\r\n\r\n[248] Perhaps that of which remains exist at Aosta, and cannot now be\r\ndated. That at Turbia was built B.C. 6 (Pliny, _N. H._ 3 \xc2\xa7 136). That\r\nat Susa in B.C. 8 [C. I. L. v. 7,231]. Horace may refer to it among the\r\n_Nova Augusti trop\xc3\xa6a_ (_Od._ 2, 9, 19).\r\n\r\n[249] Horace, _Odes_ i. 29, 1; ii. 12, 24; iii. 24, 1; i. 35, 32-40.\r\n\r\n[250] Propert., 3, 1, 11.\r\n\r\n[251] Middleton (_Remains of Ancient Rome_, vol. ii. pp. 126-128) seems\r\nto have given good reasons against its connection with the Therm\xc3\xa6 of\r\nAgrippa. Lanciani (_Ruins and Excavations_, pp. 476-488) asserts that the\r\nstructure as it now stands is of the age of Hadrian (about A.D. 129),\r\nand doubts Agrippa\xe2\x80\x99s original building being of the same shape. Even\r\nthe portico with its inscription\xe2\x80\x94M. AGRIPPA L. F. COS. TERT. FECIT\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nthinks was taken to pieces and put up again by Hadrian. The history of\r\nthe building, however, cannot be regarded as thoroughly ascertained.\r\nAgrippa\xe2\x80\x99s third consulship was in B.C. 27, whereas Dio places the\r\ncompletion of the Pantheon under B.C. 25 (53, 27). It may well have been\r\nthat the external building was finished and dedicated in B.C. 27, and\r\nthat the inside occupied two more years.\r\n\r\n[252] A. Licinius Mur\xc3\xa6na was called A. Terentius Varro Mur\xc3\xa6na from\r\nbeing adopted by Terentius Varro. See Dio, 54, 3; Suet., _Aug._ 19;\r\nHor., _Odes_ 2, 10; Velleius Paterc. 2, 91. Of Fannius C\xc3\xa6pio nothing\r\npractically is known, he was prosecuted by Tiberius for _maiestas_ and\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\n[253] In the _cenotaphia Pisana_ Gaius is described after his death as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ciam _designatum_ iustissimum ac simillimum parentis sui virtutibus\r\n_principem_.\xe2\x80\x9d But this is probably not an official title.\r\n\r\n[254] There seems little doubt that the character of Agrippa Postumus\r\ngave some ground for this measure; but Augustus seems to have regretted\r\nand at times to have contemplated recalling him. His murder immediately\r\nafter the death of Augustus is called by Tacitus \xe2\x80\x9cthe first crime of the\r\nnew reign.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether Tiberius or Livia was responsible for it cannot be\r\ndiscussed here.\r\n\r\n[255] So Dio (55, 5) says. Suetonius (_Tib._ 16) says five years. There\r\nmay have been a renewal after five years.\r\n\r\n[256] _Monum. Ancyr._ 27; C.I.L. vi. 701.\r\n\r\n[257] This is what Augustus means by saying \xe2\x80\x9cthat he extended the\r\nfrontiers of all the provinces bordering on tribes that had not\r\nsubmitted\xe2\x80\x9d (_Mon. Anc._ 26).\r\n\r\n[258] The exact position of Nabata is uncertain. It is described in the\r\n_Mon. Ancyr._ 26 as \xe2\x80\x9cclose to Meroe.\xe2\x80\x9d Augustus takes the responsibility\r\nof both these campaigns as being _meo iussu et auspicio_.\r\n\r\n[259] As, for instance, Agrippa. Hor., _Ep._ 1, 12, 1. The seven colonies\r\nmentioned are Syracuse, Tauromenium, Catana, Therm\xc3\xa6, Tyndaris, Lilyb\xc3\xa6um,\r\nPanormus.\r\n\r\n[260] Dio, 54, 8; Horace, _Od._ 3, 5; this ode was written several years\r\nbefore the restoration of the standards, but the fact of the _milites\r\nCrassi_ having settled in Parthia was naturally known.\r\n\r\n[261] Verg., _\xc3\x86n._ vii. 604-606.\r\n\r\n[262] Horace, _Ep._ i. 18, 56; _Odes_ iv. 15, 6.\r\n\r\n[263] Propert., 3, 10, 13; 4; 4, 16; 4, 5, 48; 4, 12, 3; 5, 6, 79.\r\n\r\n[264] Ovid, _F._ v. 567-594. According to Mommsen there were two temples\r\nof Mars Ultor, one on the Capitol (Dio, 54, 8), the other in the Forum\r\nAugustum, vowed at Philippi, but not dedicated till B.C. 2. The _signa_\r\nseem to have been deposited first in the former and then transferred to\r\nthe latter. Ovid evidently speaks of them as in the temple in the Forum\r\nAugustum.\r\n\r\n[265] Such as the Brenni and Genauni of Hor., _Od._ iv. 14, 10; cp. iv.\r\n4, 18.\r\n\r\n[266] _Mon.

Hell._, B.C. 14.\r\nThe tenth tribunician year is from June 27th, B.C. 14, to 26th June, B.C.\r\n13. The _ara pacis_ was founded in this year (4th July), dedicated 30th\r\nJanuary, B.C. 9.\r\n\r\n[267] But he does not seem to have had any fighting this year, and in\r\nfact the Senate voted to close the Ianus Quirinus, though that was\r\nprevented by an inroad of the Daci into Pannonia, with which Tiberius was\r\nsent to deal. Dio, 54, 36.\r\n\r\n[268] Especially in camps, in which there seem to have been a regular\r\nservice of _tabellarii castrenses_. (Wilmann\xe2\x80\x99s _Exempla_ 1357.)\r\n\r\n[269] The armed provinces were those on the frontier. Towards the end\r\nof the life of Augustus, the preponderance of the military force on\r\nthe Rhine and Danube is the noteworthy fact. The Gauls and \xe2\x80\x9cGermany\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhad eight legions, Spain three, Africa two, Egypt two, Syria four,\r\nPannonia two, M\xc5\x93sia two, Dalmatia two.
