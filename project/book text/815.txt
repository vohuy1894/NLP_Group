I readily discovered the prodigious influence\r\nwhich this primary fact exercises on the whole course of society, by\r\ngiving a certain direction to public opinion, and a certain tenor to\r\nthe laws; by imparting new maxims to the governing powers, and peculiar\r\nhabits to the governed. I speedily perceived that the influence of this\r\nfact extends far beyond the political character and the laws of the\r\ncountry, and that it has no less empire over civil society than over\r\nthe Government; it creates opinions, engenders sentiments, suggests the\r\nordinary practices of life, and modifies whatever it does not produce.\r\nThe more I advanced in the study of American society, the more I\r\nperceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from\r\nwhich all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all\r\nmy observations constantly terminated.\r\n\r\nI then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where I imagined that\r\nI discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the New World\r\npresented to me. I observed that the equality of conditions is daily\r\nprogressing towards those extreme limits which it seems to have reached\r\nin the United States, and that the democracy which governs the American\r\ncommunities appears to be rapidly rising into power in Europe. I hence\r\nconceived the idea of the book which is now before the reader.\r\n\r\nIt is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is going\r\non amongst us; but there are two opinions as to its nature and\r\nconsequences. To some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such\r\nmay still be checked; to others it seems irresistible, because it is\r\nthe most uniform, the most ancient, and the most permanent tendency\r\nwhich is to be found in history. Let us recollect the situation of\r\nFrance seven hundred years ago, when the territory was divided amongst\r\na small number of families, who were the owners of the soil and the\r\nrulers of the inhabitants; the right of governing descended with the\r\nfamily inheritance from generation to generation; force was the only\r\nmeans by which man could act on man, and landed property was the sole\r\nsource of power. Soon, however, the political power of the clergy was\r\nfounded, and began to exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all\r\nclasses, to the poor and the rich, the villein and the lord; equality\r\npenetrated into the Government through the Church, and the being who as\r\na serf must have vegetated in perpetual bondage took his place as a\r\npriest in the midst of nobles, and not infrequently above the heads of\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nThe different relations of men became more complicated and more\r\nnumerous as society gradually became more stable and more civilized.\r\nThence the want of civil laws was felt; and the order of legal\r\nfunctionaries soon rose from the obscurity of the tribunals and their\r\ndusty chambers, to appear at the court of the monarch, by the side of\r\nthe feudal barons in their ermine and their mail. Whilst the kings were\r\nruining themselves by their great enterprises, and the nobles\r\nexhausting their resources by private wars, the lower orders were\r\nenriching themselves by commerce. The influence of money began to be\r\nperceptible in State affairs. The transactions of business opened a new\r\nroad to power, and the financier rose to a station of political\r\ninfluence in which he was at once flattered and despised. Gradually the\r\nspread of mental acquirements, and the increasing taste for literature\r\nand art, opened chances of success to talent; science became a means of\r\ngovernment, intelligence led to social power, and the man of letters\r\ntook a part in the affairs of the State. The value attached to the\r\nprivileges of birth decreased in the exact proportion in which new\r\npaths were struck out to advancement. In the eleventh century nobility\r\nwas beyond all price; in the thirteenth it might be purchased; it was\r\nconferred for the first time in 1270; and equality was thus introduced\r\ninto the Government by the aristocracy itself.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these seven hundred years it sometimes happened that\r\nin order to resist the authority of the Crown, or to diminish the power\r\nof their rivals, the nobles granted a certain share of political rights\r\nto the people. Or, more frequently, the king permitted the lower orders\r\nto enjoy a degree of power, with the intention of repressing the\r\naristocracy. In France the kings have always been the most active and\r\nthe most constant of levellers. When they were strong and ambitious\r\nthey spared no pains to raise the people to the level of the nobles;\r\nwhen they were temperate or weak they allowed the people to rise above\r\nthemselves. Some assisted the democracy by their talents, others by\r\ntheir vices. Louis XI and Louis XIV reduced every rank beneath the\r\nthrone to the same subjection; Louis XV descended, himself and all his\r\nCourt, into the dust.\r\n\r\nAs soon as land was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and\r\npersonal property began in its turn to confer influence and power,\r\nevery improvement which was introduced in commerce or manufacture was a\r\nfresh element of the equality of conditions. Henceforward every new\r\ndiscovery, every new want which it engendered, and every new desire\r\nwhich craved satisfaction, was a step towards the universal level. The\r\ntaste for luxury, the love of war, the sway of fashion, and the most\r\nsuperficial as well as the deepest passions of the human heart,\r\nco-operated to enrich the poor and to impoverish the rich.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the exercise of the intellect became the source of\r\nstrength and of wealth, it is impossible not to consider every addition\r\nto science, every fresh truth, and every new idea as a germ of power\r\nplaced within the reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory,\r\nthe grace of wit, the glow of imagination, the depth of thought, and\r\nall the gifts which are bestowed by Providence with an equal hand,\r\nturned to the advantage of the democracy; and even when they were in\r\nthe possession of its adversaries they still served its cause by\r\nthrowing into relief the natural greatness of man; its conquests\r\nspread, therefore, with those of civilization and knowledge, and\r\nliterature became an arsenal where the poorest and the weakest could\r\nalways find weapons to their hand.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the pages of our history, we shall scarcely meet with a\r\nsingle great event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not\r\nturned to the advantage of equality. The Crusades and the wars of the\r\nEnglish decimated the nobles and divided their possessions; the\r\nerection of communities introduced an element of democratic liberty\r\ninto the bosom of feudal monarchy; the invention of fire-arms equalized\r\nthe villein and the noble on the field of battle; printing opened the\r\nsame resources to the minds of all classes; the post was organized so\r\nas to bring the same information to the door of the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s cottage\r\nand to the gate of the palace; and Protestantism proclaimed that all\r\nmen are alike able to find the road to heaven. The discovery of America\r\noffered a thousand new paths to fortune, and placed riches and power\r\nwithin the reach of the adventurous and the obscure. If we examine what\r\nhas happened in France at intervals of fifty years, beginning with the\r\neleventh century, we shall invariably perceive that a twofold\r\nrevolution has taken place in the state of society. The noble has gone\r\ndown on the social ladder, and the roturier has gone up; the one\r\ndescends as the other rises. Every half century brings them nearer to\r\neach other, and they will very shortly meet.\r\n\r\nNor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France. Whithersoever we turn\r\nour eyes we shall witness the same continual revolution throughout the\r\nwhole of Christendom. The various occurrences of national existence\r\nhave everywhere turned to the advantage of democracy; all men have\r\naided it by their exertions: those who have intentionally labored in\r\nits cause, and those who have served it unwittingly; those who have\r\nfought for it and those who have declared themselves its opponents,\r\nhave all been driven along in the same track, have all labored to one\r\nend, some ignorantly and some unwillingly; all have been blind\r\ninstruments in the hands of God.\r\n\r\nThe gradual development of the equality of conditions is therefore a\r\nprovidential fact, and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine\r\ndecree: it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human\r\ninterference, and all events as well as all men contribute to its\r\nprogress. Would it, then, be wise to imagine that a social impulse\r\nwhich dates from so far back can be checked by the efforts of a\r\ngeneration? Is it credible that the democracy which has annihilated the\r\nfeudal system and vanquished kings will respect the citizen and the\r\ncapitalist? Will it stop now that it has grown so strong and its\r\nadversaries so weak? None can say which way we are going, for all terms\r\nof comparison are wanting: the equality of conditions is more complete\r\nin the Christian countries of the present day than it has been at any\r\ntime or in any part of the world; so that the extent of what already\r\nexists prevents us from foreseeing what may be yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe whole book which is here offered to the public has been written\r\nunder the impression of a kind of religious dread produced in the\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s mind by the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution,\r\nwhich has advanced for centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles,\r\nand which is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made. It\r\nis not necessary that God himself should speak in order to disclose to\r\nus the unquestionable signs of His will; we can discern them in the\r\nhabitual course of nature, and in the invariable tendency of events: I\r\nknow, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the orbits\r\ntraced by the Creator\xe2\x80\x99s finger. If the men of our time were led by\r\nattentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the\r\ngradual and progressive development of social equality is at once the\r\npast and future of their history, this solitary truth would confer the\r\nsacred character of a Divine decree upon the change. To attempt to\r\ncheck democracy would be in that case to resist the will of God; and\r\nthe nations would then be constrained to make the best of the social\r\nlot awarded to them by Providence.\r\n\r\nThe Christian nations of our age seem to me to present a most alarming\r\nspectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so strong that it\r\ncannot be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided:\r\ntheir fate is in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no\r\nlonger. The first duty which is at this time imposed upon those who\r\ndirect our affairs is to educate the democracy; to warm its faith, if\r\nthat be possible; to purify its morals; to direct its energies; to\r\nsubstitute a knowledge of business for its inexperience, and an\r\nacquaintance with its true interests for its blind propensities; to\r\nadapt its government to time and place, and to modify it in compliance\r\nwith the occurrences and the actors of the age. A new science of\r\npolitics is indispensable to a new world. This, however, is what we\r\nthink of least; launched in the middle of a rapid stream, we\r\nobstinately fix our eyes on the ruins which may still be described upon\r\nthe shore we have left, whilst the current sweeps us along, and drives\r\nus backwards towards the gulf.\r\n\r\nIn no country in Europe has the great social revolution which I have\r\nbeen describing made such rapid progress as in France; but it has\r\nalways been borne on by chance. The heads of the State have never had\r\nany forethought for its exigencies, and its victories have been\r\nobtained without their consent or without their knowledge. The most\r\npowerful, the most intelligent, and the most moral classes of the\r\nnation have never attempted to connect themselves with it in order to\r\nguide it. The people has consequently been abandoned to its wild\r\npropensities, and it has grown up like those outcasts who receive their\r\neducation in the public streets, and who are unacquainted with aught\r\nbut the vices and wretchedness of society. The existence of a democracy\r\nwas seemingly unknown, when on a sudden it took possession of the\r\nsupreme power. Everything was then submitted to its caprices; it was\r\nworshipped as the idol of strength; until, when it was enfeebled by its\r\nown excesses, the legislator conceived the rash project of annihilating\r\nits power, instead of instructing it and correcting its vices; no\r\nattempt was made to fit it to govern, but all were bent on excluding it\r\nfrom the government.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this has been that the democratic revolution has\r\nbeen effected only in the material parts of society, without that\r\nconcomitant change in laws, ideas, customs, and manners which was\r\nnecessary to render such a revolution beneficial. We have gotten a\r\ndemocracy, but without the conditions which lessen its vices and render\r\nits natural advantages more prominent; and although we already perceive\r\nthe evils it brings, we are ignorant of the benefits it may confer.\r\n\r\nWhile the power of the Crown, supported by the aristocracy, peaceably\r\ngoverned the nations of Europe, society possessed, in the midst of its\r\nwretchedness, several different advantages which can now scarcely be\r\nappreciated or conceived. The power of a part of his subjects was an\r\ninsurmountable barrier to the tyranny of the prince; and the monarch,\r\nwho felt the almost divine character which he enjoyed in the eyes of\r\nthe multitude, derived a motive for the just use of his power from the\r\nrespect which he inspired. High as they were placed above the people,\r\nthe nobles could not but take that calm and benevolent interest in its\r\nfate which the shepherd feels towards his flock; and without\r\nacknowledging the poor as their equals, they watched over the destiny\r\nof those whose welfare Providence had entrusted to their care. The\r\npeople never having conceived the idea of a social condition different\r\nfrom its own, and entertaining no expectation of ever ranking with its\r\nchiefs, received benefits from them without discussing their rights. It\r\ngrew attached to them when they were clement and just, and it submitted\r\nwithout resistance or servility to their exactions, as to the\r\ninevitable visitations of the arm of God. Custom, and the manners of\r\nthe time, had moreover created a species of law in the midst of\r\nviolence, and established certain limits to oppression. As the noble\r\nnever suspected that anyone would attempt to deprive him of the\r\nprivileges which he believed to be legitimate, and as the serf looked\r\nupon his own inferiority as a consequence of the immutable order of\r\nnature, it is easy to imagine that a mutual exchange of good-will took\r\nplace between two classes so differently gifted by fate. Inequality and\r\nwretchedness were then to be found in society; but the souls of neither\r\nrank of men were degraded. Men are not corrupted by the exercise of\r\npower or debased by the habit of obedience, but by the exercise of a\r\npower which they believe to be illegal and by obedience to a rule which\r\nthey consider to be usurped and oppressive. On one side was wealth,\r\nstrength, and leisure, accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the\r\nelegance of taste, the pleasures of wit, and the religion of art. On\r\nthe other was labor and a rude ignorance; but in the midst of this\r\ncoarse and ignorant multitude it was not uncommon to meet with\r\nenergetic passions, generous sentiments, profound religious\r\nconvictions, and independent virtues. The body of a State thus\r\norganized might boast of its stability, its power, and, above all, of\r\nits glory.\r\n\r\nBut the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the\r\ndivisions which once severed mankind are lowered, property is divided,\r\npower is held in common, the light of intelligence spreads, and the\r\ncapacities of all classes are equally cultivated; the State becomes\r\ndemocratic, and the empire of democracy is slowly and peaceably\r\nintroduced into the institutions and the manners of the nation. I can\r\nconceive a society in which all men would profess an equal attachment\r\nand respect for the laws of which they are the common authors; in which\r\nthe authority of the State would be respected as necessary, though not\r\nas divine; and the loyalty of the subject to its chief magistrate would\r\nnot be a passion, but a quiet and rational persuasion. Every individual\r\nbeing in the possession of rights which he is sure to retain, a kind of\r\nmanly reliance and reciprocal courtesy would arise between all classes,\r\nalike removed from pride and meanness. The people, well acquainted with\r\nits true interests, would allow that in order to profit by the\r\nadvantages of society it is necessary to satisfy its demands. In this\r\nstate of things the voluntary association of the citizens might supply\r\nthe individual exertions of the nobles, and the community would be\r\nalike protected from anarchy and from oppression.\r\n\r\nI admit that, in a democratic State thus constituted, society will not\r\nbe stationary; but the impulses of the social body may be regulated and\r\ndirected forwards; if there be less splendor than in the halls of an\r\naristocracy, the contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the\r\npleasures of enjoyment may be less excessive, but those of comfort will\r\nbe more general; the sciences may be less perfectly cultivated, but\r\nignorance will be less common; the impetuosity of the feelings will be\r\nrepressed, and the habits of the nation softened; there will be more\r\nvices and fewer crimes. In the absence of enthusiasm and of an ardent\r\nfaith, great sacrifices may be obtained from the members of a\r\ncommonwealth by an appeal to their understandings and their experience;\r\neach individual will feel the same necessity for uniting with his\r\nfellow-citizens to protect his own weakness; and as he knows that if\r\nthey are to assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that\r\nhis personal interest is identified with the interest of the community.\r\nThe nation, taken as a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious,\r\nand perhaps less strong; but the majority of the citizens will enjoy a\r\ngreater degree of prosperity, and the people will remain quiet, not\r\nbecause it despairs of amelioration, but because it is conscious of the\r\nadvantages of its condition. If all the consequences of this state of\r\nthings were not good or useful, society would at least have\r\nappropriated all such as were useful and good; and having once and for\r\never renounced the social advantages of aristocracy, mankind would\r\nenter into possession of all the benefits which democracy can afford.\r\n\r\nBut here it may be asked what we have adopted in the place of those\r\ninstitutions, those ideas, and those customs of our forefathers which\r\nwe have abandoned. The spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been\r\nsucceeded by the majesty of the laws; the people has learned to despise\r\nall authority, but fear now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than\r\nthat which was formerly paid by reverence and by love.\r\n\r\nI perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were\r\nable to cope with tyranny single-handed; but it is the Government that\r\nhas inherited the privileges of which families, corporations, and\r\nindividuals have been deprived; the weakness of the whole community has\r\ntherefore succeeded that influence of a small body of citizens, which,\r\nif it was sometimes oppressive, was often conservative. The division of\r\nproperty has lessened the distance which separated the rich from the\r\npoor; but it would seem that the nearer they draw to each other, the\r\ngreater is their mutual hatred, and the more vehement the envy and the\r\ndread with which they resist each other\xe2\x80\x99s claims to power; the notion\r\nof Right is alike insensible to both classes, and Force affords to both\r\nthe only argument for the present, and the only guarantee for the\r\nfuture. The poor man retains the prejudices of his forefathers without\r\ntheir faith, and their ignorance without their virtues; he has adopted\r\nthe doctrine of self-interest as the rule of his actions, without\r\nunderstanding the science which controls it, and his egotism is no less\r\nblind than his devotedness was formerly. If society is tranquil, it is\r\nnot because it relies upon its strength and its well-being, but because\r\nit knows its weakness and its infirmities; a single effort may cost it\r\nits life; everybody feels the evil, but no one has courage or energy\r\nenough to seek the cure; the desires, the regret, the sorrows, and the\r\njoys of the time produce nothing that is visible or permanent, like the\r\npassions of old men which terminate in impotence.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old state of things\r\nafforded, without receiving any compensation from our present\r\ncondition; we have destroyed an aristocracy, and we seem inclined to\r\nsurvey its ruins with complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which the intellectual world presents are not less\r\ndeplorable. The democracy of France, checked in its course or abandoned\r\nto its lawless passions, has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and\r\nhas shaken all that it has not destroyed. Its empire on society has not\r\nbeen gradually introduced or peaceably established, but it has\r\nconstantly advanced in the midst of disorder and the agitation of a\r\nconflict. In the heat of the struggle each partisan is hurried beyond\r\nthe limits of his opinions by the opinions and the excesses of his\r\nopponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds\r\na language which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts.\r\nHence arises the strange confusion which we are witnessing. I cannot\r\nrecall to my mind a passage in history more worthy of sorrow and of\r\npity than the scenes which are happening under our eyes; it is as if\r\nthe natural bond which unites the opinions of man to his tastes and his\r\nactions to his principles was now broken; the sympathy which has always\r\nbeen acknowledged between the feelings and the ideas of mankind appears\r\nto be dissolved, and all the laws of moral analogy to be abolished.\r\n\r\nZealous Christians may be found amongst us whose minds are nurtured in\r\nthe love and knowledge of a future life, and who readily espouse the\r\ncause of human liberty as the source of all moral greatness.\r\nChristianity, which has declared that all men are equal in the sight of\r\nGod, will not refuse to acknowledge that all citizens are equal in the\r\neye of the law. But, by a singular concourse of events, religion is\r\nentangled in those institutions which democracy assails, and it is not\r\nunfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves, and to curse that\r\ncause of liberty as a foe which it might hallow by its alliance.\r\n\r\nBy the side of these religious men I discern others whose looks are\r\nturned to the earth more than to Heaven; they are the partisans of\r\nliberty, not only as the source of the noblest virtues, but more\r\nespecially as the root of all solid advantages; and they sincerely\r\ndesire to extend its sway, and to impart its blessings to mankind. It\r\nis natural that they should hasten to invoke the assistance of\r\nreligion, for they must know that liberty cannot be established without\r\nmorality, nor morality without faith; but they have seen religion in\r\nthe ranks of their adversaries, and they inquire no further; some of\r\nthem attack it openly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.\r\n\r\nIn former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal and\r\nslavish-minded, whilst the independent and the warm-hearted were\r\nstruggling without hope to save the liberties of mankind. But men of\r\nhigh and generous characters are now to be met with, whose opinions are\r\nat variance with their inclinations, and who praise that servility\r\nwhich they have themselves never known. Others, on the contrary, speak\r\nin the name of liberty, as if they were able to feel its sanctity and\r\nits majesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights which they have\r\nalways disowned. There are virtuous and peaceful individuals whose pure\r\nmorality, quiet habits, affluence, and talents fit them to be the\r\nleaders of the surrounding population; their love of their country is\r\nsincere, and they are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its\r\nwelfare, but they confound the abuses of civilization with its\r\nbenefits, and the idea of evil is inseparable in their minds from that\r\nof novelty.\r\n\r\nNot far from this class is another party, whose object is to\r\nmaterialize mankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what\r\nis just, to acquire knowledge without faith, and prosperity apart from\r\nvirtue; assuming the title of the champions of modern civilization, and\r\nplacing themselves in a station which they usurp with insolence, and\r\nfrom which they are driven by their own unworthiness. Where are we\r\nthen? The religionists are the enemies of liberty, and the friends of\r\nliberty attack religion; the high-minded and the noble advocate\r\nsubjection, and the meanest and most servile minds preach independence;\r\nhonest and enlightened citizens are opposed to all progress, whilst men\r\nwithout patriotism and without principles are the apostles of\r\ncivilization and of intelligence. Has such been the fate of the\r\ncenturies which have preceded our own? and has man always inhabited a\r\nworld like the present, where nothing is linked together, where virtue\r\nis without genius, and genius without honor; where the love of order is\r\nconfounded with a taste for oppression, and the holy rites of freedom\r\nwith a contempt of law; where the light thrown by conscience on human\r\nactions is dim, and where nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or\r\nallowed, honorable or shameful, false or true? I cannot, however,\r\nbelieve that the Creator made man to leave him in an endless struggle\r\nwith the intellectual miseries which surround us: God destines a calmer\r\nand a more certain future to the communities of Europe; I am\r\nunacquainted with His designs, but I shall not cease to believe in them\r\nbecause I cannot fathom them, and I had rather mistrust my own capacity\r\nthan His justice.\r\n\r\nThere is a country in the world where the great revolution which I am\r\nspeaking of seems nearly to have reached its natural limits; it has\r\nbeen effected with ease and simplicity, say rather that this country\r\nhas attained the consequences of the democratic revolution which we are\r\nundergoing without having experienced the revolution itself. The\r\nemigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of America in the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century severed the democratic principle\r\nfrom all the principles which repressed it in the old communities of\r\nEurope, and transplanted it unalloyed to the New World. It has there\r\nbeen allowed to spread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its\r\nconsequences in the laws by influencing the manners of the country.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me beyond a doubt that sooner or later we shall arrive,\r\nlike the Americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. But I\r\ndo not conclude from this that we shall ever be necessarily led to draw\r\nthe same political consequences which the Americans have derived from a\r\nsimilar social organization. I am far from supposing that they have\r\nchosen the only form of government which a democracy may adopt; but the\r\nidentity of the efficient cause of laws and manners in the two\r\ncountries is sufficient to account for the immense interest we have in\r\nbecoming acquainted with its effects in each of them.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that I have\r\nexamined America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may\r\nourselves profit. Whoever should imagine that I have intended to write\r\na panegyric will perceive that such was not my design; nor has it been\r\nmy object to advocate any form of government in particular, for I am of\r\nopinion that absolute excellence is rarely to be found in any\r\nlegislation; I have not even affected to discuss whether the social\r\nrevolution, which I believe to be irresistible, is advantageous or\r\nprejudicial to mankind; I have acknowledged this revolution as a fact\r\nalready accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment; and I have\r\nselected the nation, from amongst those which have undergone it, in\r\nwhich its development has been the most peaceful and the most complete,\r\nin order to discern its natural consequences, and, if it be possible,\r\nto distinguish the means by which it may be rendered profitable. I\r\nconfess that in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of\r\ndemocracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices,\r\nand its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or to hope\r\nfrom its progress.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this work I have attempted to show the tendency\r\ngiven to the laws by the democracy of America, which is abandoned\r\nalmost without restraint to its instinctive propensities, and to\r\nexhibit the course it prescribes to the Government and the influence it\r\nexercises on affairs. I have sought to discover the evils and the\r\nadvantages which it produces. I have examined the precautions used by\r\nthe Americans to direct it, as well as those which they have not\r\nadopted, and I have undertaken to point out the causes which enable it\r\nto govern society. I do not know whether I have succeeded in making\r\nknown what I saw in America, but I am certain that such has been my\r\nsincere desire, and that I have never, knowingly, moulded facts to\r\nideas, instead of ideas to facts.\r\n\r\nWhenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents,\r\nI have had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and\r\napproved works. I have cited my authorities in the notes, and anyone\r\nmay refer to them. Whenever an opinion, a political custom, or a remark\r\non the manners of the country was concerned, I endeavored to consult\r\nthe most enlightened men I met with. If the point in question was\r\nimportant or doubtful, I was not satisfied with one testimony, but I\r\nformed my opinion on the evidence of several witnesses. Here the reader\r\nmust necessarily believe me upon my word. I could frequently have\r\nquoted names which are either known to him, or which deserve to be so,\r\nin proof of what I advance; but I have carefully abstained from this\r\npractice. A stranger frequently hears important truths at the fire-side\r\nof his host, which the latter would perhaps conceal from the ear of\r\nfriendship; he consoles himself with his guest for the silence to which\r\nhe is restricted, and the shortness of the traveller\xe2\x80\x99s stay takes away\r\nall fear of his indiscretion. I carefully noted every conversation of\r\nthis nature as soon as it occurred, but these notes will never leave my\r\nwriting-case; I had rather injure the success of my statements than add\r\nmy name to the list of those strangers who repay the generous\r\nhospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and annoyance.\r\n\r\nI am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be easier than\r\nto criticise this book, if anyone ever chooses to criticise it. Those\r\nreaders who may examine it closely will discover the fundamental idea\r\nwhich connects the several parts together. But the diversity of the\r\nsubjects I have had to treat is exceedingly great, and it will not be\r\ndifficult to oppose an isolated fact to the body of facts which I\r\nquote, or an isolated idea to the body of ideas I put forth. I hope to\r\nbe read in the spirit which has guided my labors, and that my book may\r\nbe judged by the general impression it leaves, as I have formed my own\r\njudgment not on any single reason, but upon the mass of evidence. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that the author who wishes to be understood is\r\nobliged to push all his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences,\r\nand often to the verge of what is false or impracticable; for if it be\r\nnecessary sometimes to quit the rules of logic in active life, such is\r\nnot the case in discourse, and a man finds that almost as many\r\ndifficulties spring from inconsistency of language as usually arise\r\nfrom inconsistency of conduct.\r\n\r\nI conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider the\r\nprincipal defect of the work. This book is written to favor no\r\nparticular views, and in composing it I have entertained no designs of\r\nserving or attacking any party; I have undertaken not to see\r\ndifferently, but to look further than parties, and whilst they are\r\nbusied for the morrow I have turned my thoughts to the Future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter I: Exterior Form Of North America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth America divided into two vast regions, one inclining towards the\r\nPole, the other towards the Equator\xe2\x80\x94Valley of the Mississippi\xe2\x80\x94Traces of\r\nthe Revolutions of the Globe\xe2\x80\x94Shore of the Atlantic Ocean where the\r\nEnglish Colonies were founded\xe2\x80\x94Difference in the appearance of North and\r\nof South America at the time of their Discovery\xe2\x80\x94Forests of North\r\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x94Prairies\xe2\x80\x94Wandering Tribes of Natives\xe2\x80\x94Their outward appearance,\r\nmanners, and language\xe2\x80\x94Traces of an unknown people.\r\n\r\nExterior Form Of North America\r\n\r\nNorth America presents in its external form certain general features\r\nwhich it is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A sort of\r\nmethodical order seems to have regulated the separation of land and\r\nwater, mountains and valleys. A simple, but grand, arrangement is\r\ndiscoverable amidst the confusion of objects and the prodigious variety\r\nof scenes. This continent is divided, almost equally, into two vast\r\nregions, one of which is bounded on the north by the Arctic Pole, and\r\nby the two great oceans on the east and west. It stretches towards the\r\nsouth, forming a triangle whose irregular sides meet at length below\r\nthe great lakes of Canada. The second region begins where the other\r\nterminates, and includes all the remainder of the continent. The one\r\nslopes gently towards the Pole, the other towards the Equator.\r\n\r\nThe territory comprehended in the first region descends towards the\r\nnorth with so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form\r\na level plain. Within the bounds of this immense tract of country there\r\nare neither high mountains nor deep valleys. Streams meander through it\r\nirregularly: great rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again,\r\ndisperse and form vast marshes, losing all trace of their channels in\r\nthe labyrinth of waters they have themselves created; and thus, at\r\nlength, after innumerable windings, fall into the Polar Seas. The great\r\nlakes which bound this first region are not walled in, like most of\r\nthose in the Old World, between hills and rocks. Their banks are flat,\r\nand rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each of them\r\nthus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in\r\nthe structure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either\r\ntowards the Pole or to the tropical sea.\r\n\r\nThe second region is more varied on its surface, and better suited for\r\nthe habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains divide it from one\r\nextreme to the other; the Alleghany ridge takes the form of the shores\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean; the other is parallel with the Pacific. The\r\nspace which lies between these two chains of mountains contains\r\n1,341,649 square miles. *a Its surface is therefore about six times as\r\ngreat as that of France. This vast territory, however, forms a single\r\nvalley, one side of which descends gradually from the rounded summits\r\nof the Alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted course\r\ntowards the tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of the valley\r\nflows an immense river, into which the various streams issuing from the\r\nmountains fall from all parts. In memory of their native land, the\r\nFrench formerly called this river the St. Louis. The Indians, in their\r\npompous language, have named it the Father of Waters, or the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ Darby\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cView of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two great\r\nregions of which I have spoken, not far from the highest point of the\r\ntable-land where they unite. Near the same spot rises another river, *b\r\nwhich empties itself into the Polar seas. The course of the Mississippi\r\nis at first dubious: it winds several times towards the north, from\r\nwhence it rose; and at length, after having been delayed in lakes and\r\nmarshes, it flows slowly onwards to the south. Sometimes quietly\r\ngliding along the argillaceous bed which nature has assigned to it,\r\nsometimes swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500 miles in its\r\ncourse. *c At the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this river\r\nattains an average depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated by\r\nvessels of 300 tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles.\r\nFifty-seven large navigable rivers contribute to swell the waters of\r\nthe Mississippi; amongst others, the Missouri, which traverses a space\r\nof 2,500 miles; the Arkansas of 1,300 miles, the Red River 1,000 miles,\r\nfour whose course is from 800 to 1,000 miles in length, viz., the\r\nIllinois, the St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, the St. Francis, and the Moingona; besides a\r\ncountless multitude of rivulets which unite from all parts their\r\ntributary streams.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ The Red River.]\r\n\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ Warden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDescription of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems formed to be the\r\nbed of this mighty river, which, like a god of antiquity, dispenses\r\nboth good and evil in its course. On the shores of the stream nature\r\ndisplays an inexhaustible fertility; in proportion as you recede from\r\nits banks, the powers of vegetation languish, the soil becomes poor,\r\nand the plants that survive have a sickly growth. Nowhere have the\r\ngreat convulsions of the globe left more evident traces than in the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi; the whole aspect of the country shows the\r\npowerful effects of water, both by its fertility and by its barrenness.\r\nThe waters of the primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of vegetable\r\nmould in the valley, which they levelled as they retired. Upon the\r\nright shore of the river are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the\r\nhusbandman had passed over them with his roller. As you approach the\r\nmountains the soil becomes more and more unequal and sterile; the\r\nground is, as it were, pierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks,\r\nwhich appear like the bones of a skeleton whose flesh is partly\r\nconsumed. The surface of the earth is covered with a granite sand and\r\nhuge irregular masses of stone, among which a few plants force their\r\ngrowth, and give the appearance of a green field covered with the ruins\r\nof a vast edifice. These stones and this sand discover, on examination,\r\na perfect analogy with those which compose the arid and broken summits\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. The flood of waters which washed the soil to\r\nthe bottom of the valley afterwards carried away portions of the rocks\r\nthemselves; and these, dashed and bruised against the neighboring\r\ncliffs, were left scattered like wrecks at their feet. *d The valley of\r\nthe Mississippi is, upon the whole, the most magnificent dwelling-place\r\nprepared by God for man\xe2\x80\x99s abode; and yet it may be said that at present\r\nit is but a mighty desert.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ See Appendix, A.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the Alleghanies, between the base of these\r\nmountains and the Atlantic Ocean, there lies a long ridge of rocks and\r\nsand, which the sea appears to have left behind as it retired. The mean\r\nbreadth of this territory does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is\r\nabout nine hundred miles in length. This part of the American continent\r\nhas a soil which offers every obstacle to the husbandman, and its\r\nvegetation is scanty and unvaried.\r\n\r\nUpon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of human industry\r\nwere made. The tongue of arid land was the cradle of those English\r\ncolonies which were destined one day to become the United States of\r\nAmerica. The centre of power still remains here; whilst in the\r\nbackwoods the true elements of the great people to whom the future\r\ncontrol of the continent belongs are gathering almost in secrecy\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWhen the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West Indies, and\r\nafterwards on the coast of South America, they thought themselves\r\ntransported into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. The\r\nsea sparkled with phosphoric light, and the extraordinary transparency\r\nof its waters discovered to the view of the navigator all that had\r\nhitherto been hidden in the deep abyss. *e Here and there appeared\r\nlittle islands perfumed with odoriferous plants, and resembling baskets\r\nof flowers floating on the tranquil surface of the ocean. Every object\r\nwhich met the sight, in this enchanting region, seemed prepared to\r\nsatisfy the wants or contribute to the pleasures of man. Almost all the\r\ntrees were loaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless\r\nas food delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their\r\ncolors. In groves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering\r\nmyrtles, acacias, and oleanders, which were hung with festoons of\r\nvarious climbing plants, covered with flowers, a multitude of birds\r\nunknown in Europe displayed their bright plumage, glittering with\r\npurple and azure, and mingled their warbling with the harmony of a\r\nworld teeming with life and motion. *f Underneath this brilliant\r\nexterior death was concealed. But the air of these climates had so\r\nenervating an influence that man, absorbed by present enjoyment, was\r\nrendered regardless of the future.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ Malte Brun tells us (vol. v. p. 726) that the water of the Caribbean\r\nSea is so transparent that corals and fish are discernible at a depth\r\nof sixty fathoms. The ship seemed to float in air, the navigator became\r\ngiddy as his eye penetrated through the crystal flood, and beheld\r\nsubmarine gardens, or beds of shells, or gilded fishes gliding among\r\ntufts and thickets of seaweed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ See Appendix, B.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth America appeared under a very different aspect; there everything\r\nwas grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created to be the domain of\r\nintelligence, as the South was that of sensual delight. A turbulent and\r\nfoggy ocean washed its shores. It was girt round by a belt of granite\r\nrocks, or by wide tracts of sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and\r\ngloomy, for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild\r\nolive-trees, and laurels. Beyond this outer belt lay the thick shades\r\nof the central forest, where the largest trees which are produced in\r\nthe two hemispheres grow side by side. The plane, the catalpa, the\r\nsugar-maple, and the Virginian poplar mingled their branches with those\r\nof the oak, the beech, and the lime. In these, as in the forests of the\r\nOld World, destruction was perpetually going on. The ruins of\r\nvegetation were heaped upon each other; but there was no laboring hand\r\nto remove them, and their decay was not rapid enough to make room for\r\nthe continual work of reproduction. Climbing plants, grasses, and other\r\nherbs forced their way through the mass of dying trees; they crept\r\nalong their bending trunks, found nourishment in their dusty cavities,\r\nand a passage beneath the lifeless bark. Thus decay gave its assistance\r\nto life, and their respective productions were mingled together. The\r\ndepths of these forests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand\r\nrivulets, undirected in their course by human industry, preserved in\r\nthem a constant moisture. It was rare to meet with flowers, wild\r\nfruits, or birds beneath their shades. The fall of a tree overthrown by\r\nage, the rushing torrent of a cataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and\r\nthe howling of the wind were the only sounds which broke the silence of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the great river, the woods almost disappeared; in their\r\nstead were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether Nature in her\r\ninfinite variety had denied the germs of trees to these fertile plains,\r\nor whether they had once been covered with forests, subsequently\r\ndestroyed by the hand of man, is a question which neither tradition nor\r\nscientific research has been able to resolve.\r\n\r\nThese immense deserts were not, however, devoid of human inhabitants.\r\nSome wandering tribes had been for ages scattered among the forest\r\nshades or the green pastures of the prairie. From the mouth of the St.\r\nLawrence to the delta of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific Ocean, these savages possessed certain points of resemblance\r\nwhich bore witness of their common origin; but at the same time they\r\ndiffered from all other known races of men: *g they were neither white\r\nlike the Europeans, nor yellow like most of the Asiatics, nor black\r\nlike the negroes. Their skin was reddish brown, their hair long and\r\nshining, their lips thin, and their cheekbones very prominent. The\r\nlanguages spoken by the North American tribes are various as far as\r\nregarded their words, but they were subject to the same grammatical\r\nrules. These rules differed in several points from such as had been\r\nobserved to govern the origin of language. The idiom of the Americans\r\nseemed to be the product of new combinations, and bespoke an effort of\r\nthe understanding of which the Indians of our days would be incapable.\r\n*h\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ With the progress of discovery some resemblance has been found to\r\nexist between the physical conformation, the language, and the habits\r\nof the Indians of North America, and those of the Tongous, Mantchous,\r\nMongols, Tartars, and other wandering tribes of Asia. The land occupied\r\nby these tribes is not very distant from Behring\xe2\x80\x99s Strait, which allows\r\nof the supposition, that at a remote period they gave inhabitants to\r\nthe desert continent of America. But this is a point which has not yet\r\nbeen clearly elucidated by science. See Malte Brun, vol. v.; the works\r\nof Humboldt; Fischer, \xe2\x80\x9cConjecture sur l\xe2\x80\x99Origine des Americains\xe2\x80\x9d; Adair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory of the American Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ See Appendix, C.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe social state of these tribes differed also in many respects from\r\nall that was seen in the Old World. They seemed to have multiplied\r\nfreely in the midst of their deserts without coming in contact with\r\nother races more civilized than their own. Accordingly, they exhibited\r\nnone of those indistinct, incoherent notions of right and wrong, none\r\nof that deep corruption of manners, which is usually joined with\r\nignorance and rudeness among nations which, after advancing to\r\ncivilization, have relapsed into a state of barbarism. The Indian was\r\nindebted to no one but himself; his virtues, his vices, and his\r\nprejudices were his own work; he had grown up in the wild independence\r\nof his nature.\r\n\r\nIf, in polished countries, the lowest of the people are rude and\r\nuncivil, it is not merely because they are poor and ignorant, but that,\r\nbeing so, they are in daily contact with rich and enlightened men. The\r\nsight of their own hard lot and of their weakness, which is daily\r\ncontrasted with the happiness and power of some of their\r\nfellow-creatures, excites in their hearts at the same time the\r\nsentiments of anger and of fear: the consciousness of their inferiority\r\nand of their dependence irritates while it humiliates them. This state\r\nof mind displays itself in their manners and language; they are at once\r\ninsolent and servile. The truth of this is easily proved by\r\nobservation; the people are more rude in aristocratic countries than\r\nelsewhere, in opulent cities than in rural districts. In those places\r\nwhere the rich and powerful are assembled together the weak and the\r\nindigent feel themselves oppressed by their inferior condition. Unable\r\nto perceive a single chance of regaining their equality, they give up\r\nto despair, and allow themselves to fall below the dignity of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is not\r\nobservable in savage life: the Indians, although they are ignorant and\r\npoor, are equal and free. At the period when Europeans first came among\r\nthem the natives of North America were ignorant of the value of riches,\r\nand indifferent to the enjoyments which civilized man procures to\r\nhimself by their means. Nevertheless there was nothing coarse in their\r\ndemeanor; they practised an habitual reserve and a kind of aristocratic\r\npoliteness. Mild and hospitable when at peace, though merciless in war\r\nbeyond any known degree of human ferocity, the Indian would expose\r\nhimself to die of hunger in order to succor the stranger who asked\r\nadmittance by night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in pieces\r\nwith his hands the still quivering limbs of his prisoner. The famous\r\nrepublics of antiquity never gave examples of more unshaken courage,\r\nmore haughty spirits, or more intractable love of independence than\r\nwere hidden in former times among the wild forests of the New World. *i\r\nThe Europeans produced no great impression when they landed upon the\r\nshores of North America; their presence engendered neither envy nor\r\nfear. What influence could they possess over such men as we have\r\ndescribed? The Indian could live without wants, suffer without\r\ncomplaint, and pour out his death-song at the stake. *j Like all the\r\nother members of the great human family, these savages believed in the\r\nexistence of a better world, and adored under different names, God, the\r\ncreator of the universe. Their notions on the great intellectual truths\r\nwere in general simple and philosophical. *k\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ We learn from President Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNotes upon Virginia,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 148,\r\nthat among the Iroquois, when attacked by a superior force, aged men\r\nrefused to fly or to survive the destruction of their country; and they\r\nbraved death like the ancient Romans when their capital was sacked by\r\nthe Gauls. Further on, p. 150, he tells us that there is no example of\r\nan Indian who, having fallen into the hands of his enemies, begged for\r\nhis life; on the contrary, the captive sought to obtain death at the\r\nhands of his conquerors by the use of insult and provocation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cHistoire de la Louisiane,\xe2\x80\x9d by Lepage Dupratz; Charlevoix,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistoire de la Nouvelle France\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cLettres du Rev.

What is said by Jefferson is of\r\nespecial weight, on account of the personal merit of the writer, of his\r\npeculiar position, and of the matter-of-fact age in which he lived.]\r\n\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ See Appendix, D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have here traced the character of a primitive people, yet\r\nit cannot be doubted that another people, more civilized and more\r\nadvanced in all respects, had preceded it in the same regions.\r\n\r\nAn obscure tradition which prevailed among the Indians to the north of\r\nthe Atlantic informs us that these very tribes formerly dwelt on the\r\nwest side of the Mississippi. Along the banks of the Ohio, and\r\nthroughout the central valley, there are frequently found, at this day,\r\ntumuli raised by the hands of men. On exploring these heaps of earth to\r\ntheir centre, it is usual to meet with human bones, strange\r\ninstruments, arms and utensils of all kinds, made of metal, or destined\r\nfor purposes unknown to the present race. The Indians of our time are\r\nunable to give any information relative to the history of this unknown\r\npeople. Neither did those who lived three hundred years ago, when\r\nAmerica was first discovered, leave any accounts from which even an\r\nhypothesis could be formed. Tradition\xe2\x80\x94that perishable, yet ever renewed\r\nmonument of the pristine world\xe2\x80\x94throws no light upon the subject. It is\r\nan undoubted fact, however, that in this part of the globe thousands of\r\nour fellow-beings had lived. When they came hither, what was their\r\norigin, their destiny, their history, and how they perished, no one can\r\ntell. How strange does it appear that nations have existed, and\r\nafterwards so completely disappeared from the earth that the\r\nremembrance of their very names is effaced; their languages are lost;\r\ntheir glory is vanished like a sound without an echo; though perhaps\r\nthere is not one which has not left behind it some tomb in memory of\r\nits passage! The most durable monument of human labor is that which\r\nrecalls the wretchedness and nothingness of man.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vast country which we have been describing was inhabited\r\nby many indigenous tribes, it may justly be said at the time of its\r\ndiscovery by Europeans to have formed one great desert. The Indians\r\noccupied without possessing it. It is by agricultural labor that man\r\nappropriates the soil, and the early inhabitants of North America lived\r\nby the produce of the chase. Their implacable prejudices, their\r\nuncontrolled passions, their vices, and still more perhaps their savage\r\nvirtues, consigned them to inevitable destruction. The ruin of these\r\nnations began from the day when Europeans landed on their shores; it\r\nhas proceeded ever since, and we are now witnessing the completion of\r\nit. They seem to have been placed by Providence amidst the riches of\r\nthe New World to enjoy them for a season, and then surrender them.\r\nThose coasts, so admirably adapted for commerce and industry; those\r\nwide and deep rivers; that inexhaustible valley of the Mississippi; the\r\nwhole continent, in short, seemed prepared to be the abode of a great\r\nnation, yet unborn.\r\n\r\nIn that land the great experiment was to be made, by civilized man, of\r\nthe attempt to construct society upon a new basis; and it was there,\r\nfor the first time, that theories hitherto unknown, or deemed\r\nimpracticable, were to exhibit a spectacle for which the world had not\r\nbeen prepared by the history of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter II: Origin Of The Anglo-Americans\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nUtility of knowing the origin of nations in order to understand their\r\nsocial condition and their laws\xe2\x80\x94America the only country in which the\r\nstarting-point of a great people has been clearly observable\xe2\x80\x94In what\r\nrespects all who emigrated to British America were similar\xe2\x80\x94In what they\r\ndiffered\xe2\x80\x94Remark applicable to all Europeans who established themselves\r\non the shores of the New World\xe2\x80\x94Colonization of Virginia\xe2\x80\x94Colonization of\r\nNew England\xe2\x80\x94Original character of the first inhabitants of New\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94Their arrival\xe2\x80\x94Their first laws\xe2\x80\x94Their social contract\xe2\x80\x94Penal code\r\nborrowed from the Hebrew legislation\xe2\x80\x94Religious fervor\xe2\x80\x94Republican\r\nspirit\xe2\x80\x94Intimate union of the spirit of religion with the spirit of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nOrigin Of The Anglo-Americans, And Its Importance In Relation To Their\r\nFuture Condition.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of a human being his early years are obscurely spent in\r\nthe toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up the world receives\r\nhim, when his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his\r\nfellows. He is then studied for the first time, and it is imagined that\r\nthe germ of the vices and the virtues of his maturer years is then\r\nformed. This, if I am not mistaken, is a great error. We must begin\r\nhigher up; we must watch the infant in its mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms; we must see\r\nthe first images which the external world casts upon the dark mirror of\r\nhis mind; the first occurrences which he witnesses; we must hear the\r\nfirst words which awaken the sleeping powers of thought, and stand by\r\nhis earliest efforts, if we would understand the prejudices, the\r\nhabits, and the passions which will rule his life. The entire man is,\r\nso to speak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.\r\n\r\nThe growth of nations presents something analogous to this: they all\r\nbear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which\r\naccompanied their birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole\r\nterm of their being. If we were able to go back to the elements of\r\nstates, and to examine the oldest monuments of their history, I doubt\r\nnot that we should discover the primal cause of the prejudices, the\r\nhabits, the ruling passions, and, in short, of all that constitutes\r\nwhat is called the national character; we should then find the\r\nexplanation of certain customs which now seem at variance with the\r\nprevailing manners; of such laws as conflict with established\r\nprinciples; and of such incoherent opinions as are here and there to be\r\nmet with in society, like those fragments of broken chains which we\r\nsometimes see hanging from the vault of an edifice, and supporting\r\nnothing. This might explain the destinies of certain nations, which\r\nseem borne on by an unknown force to ends of which they themselves are\r\nignorant. But hitherto facts have been wanting to researches of this\r\nkind: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon communities in their\r\nlatter days; and when they at length contemplated their origin, time\r\nhad already obscured it, or ignorance and pride adorned it with\r\ntruth-concealing fables.\r\n\r\nAmerica is the only country in which it has been possible to witness\r\nthe natural and tranquil growth of society, and where the influences\r\nexercised on the future condition of states by their origin is clearly\r\ndistinguishable. At the period when the peoples of Europe landed in the\r\nNew World their national characteristics were already completely\r\nformed; each of them had a physiognomy of its own; and as they had\r\nalready attained that stage of civilization at which men are led to\r\nstudy themselves, they have transmitted to us a faithful picture of\r\ntheir opinions, their manners, and their laws. The men of the sixteenth\r\ncentury are almost as well known to us as our contemporaries. America,\r\nconsequently, exhibits in the broad light of day the phenomena which\r\nthe ignorance or rudeness of earlier ages conceals from our researches.\r\nNear enough to the time when the states of America were founded, to be\r\naccurately acquainted with their elements, and sufficiently removed\r\nfrom that period to judge of some of their results, the men of our own\r\nday seem destined to see further than their predecessors into the\r\nseries of human events. Providence has given us a torch which our\r\nforefathers did not possess, and has allowed us to discern fundamental\r\ncauses in the history of the world which the obscurity of the past\r\nconcealed from them. If we carefully examine the social and political\r\nstate of America, after having studied its history, we shall remain\r\nperfectly convinced that not an opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may\r\neven say not an event, is upon record which the origin of that people\r\nwill not explain. The readers of this book will find the germ of all\r\nthat is to follow in the present chapter, and the key to almost the\r\nwhole work.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy the territory\r\nnow covered by the American Union differed from each other in many\r\nrespects; their aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on\r\ndifferent principles. These men had, however, certain features in\r\ncommon, and they were all placed in an analogous situation. The tie of\r\nlanguage is perhaps the strongest and the most durable that can unite\r\nmankind. All the emigrants spoke the same tongue; they were all offsets\r\nfrom the same people. Born in a country which had been agitated for\r\ncenturies by the struggles of faction, and in which all parties had\r\nbeen obliged in their turn to place themselves under the protection of\r\nthe laws, their political education had been perfected in this rude\r\nschool, and they were more conversant with the notions of right and the\r\nprinciples of true freedom than the greater part of their European\r\ncontemporaries. At the period of their first emigrations the parish\r\nsystem, that fruitful germ of free institutions, was deeply rooted in\r\nthe habits of the English; and with it the doctrine of the sovereignty\r\nof the people had been introduced into the bosom of the monarchy of the\r\nHouse of Tudor.\r\n\r\nThe religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian world were\r\nthen rife. England had plunged into the new order of things with\r\nheadlong vehemence. The character of its inhabitants, which had always\r\nbeen sedate and reflective, became argumentative and austere. General\r\ninformation had been increased by intellectual debate, and the mind had\r\nreceived a deeper cultivation. Whilst religion was the topic of\r\ndiscussion, the morals of the people were reformed. All these national\r\nfeatures are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of those\r\nadventurers who came to seek a new home on the opposite shores of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nAnother remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion to recur, is\r\napplicable not only to the English, but to the French, the Spaniards,\r\nand all the Europeans who successively established themselves in the\r\nNew World. All these European colonies contained the elements, if not\r\nthe development, of a complete democracy. Two causes led to this\r\nresult. It may safely be advanced, that on leaving the mother-country\r\nthe emigrants had in general no notion of superiority over one another.\r\nThe happy and the powerful do not go into exile, and there are no surer\r\nguarantees of equality among men than poverty and misfortune. It\r\nhappened, however, on several occasions, that persons of rank were\r\ndriven to America by political and religious quarrels. Laws were made\r\nto establish a gradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil\r\nof America was opposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring that\r\nrefractory land into cultivation, the constant and interested exertions\r\nof the owner himself were necessary; and when the ground was prepared,\r\nits produce was found to be insufficient to enrich a master and a\r\nfarmer at the same time. The land was then naturally broken up into\r\nsmall portions, which the proprietor cultivated for himself. Land is\r\nthe basis of an aristocracy, which clings to the soil that supports it;\r\nfor it is not by privileges alone, nor by birth, but by landed property\r\nhanded down from generation to generation, that an aristocracy is\r\nconstituted. A nation may present immense fortunes and extreme\r\nwretchedness, but unless those fortunes are territorial there is no\r\naristocracy, but simply the class of the rich and that of the poor.\r\n\r\nAll the British colonies had then a great degree of similarity at the\r\nepoch of their settlement. All of them, from their first beginning,\r\nseemed destined to witness the growth, not of the aristocratic liberty\r\nof their mother-country, but of that freedom of the middle and lower\r\norders of which the history of the world had as yet furnished no\r\ncomplete example.\r\n\r\nIn this general uniformity several striking differences were however\r\ndiscernible, which it is necessary to point out. Two branches may be\r\ndistinguished in the Anglo-American family, which have hitherto grown\r\nup without entirely commingling; the one in the South, the other in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nVirginia received the first English colony; the emigrants took\r\npossession of it in 1607. The idea that mines of gold and silver are\r\nthe sources of national wealth was at that time singularly prevalent in\r\nEurope; a fatal delusion, which has done more to impoverish the nations\r\nwhich adopted it, and has cost more lives in America, than the united\r\ninfluence of war and bad laws. The men sent to Virginia *a were seekers\r\nof gold, adventurers, without resources and without character, whose\r\nturbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony, *b and\r\nrendered its progress uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists\r\narrived afterwards; and, although they were a more moral and orderly\r\nrace of men, they were in nowise above the level of the inferior\r\nclasses in England. *c No lofty conceptions, no intellectual system,\r\ndirected the foundation of these new settlements. The colony was\r\nscarcely established when slavery was introduced, *d and this was the\r\nmain circumstance which has exercised so prodigious an influence on the\r\ncharacter, the laws, and all the future prospects of the South.\r\nSlavery, as we shall afterwards show, dishonors labor; it introduces\r\nidleness into society, and with idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury\r\nand distress. It enervates the powers of the mind, and benumbs the\r\nactivity of man. The influence of slavery, united to the English\r\ncharacter, explains the manners and the social condition of the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ The charter granted by the Crown of England in 1609 stipulated,\r\namongst other conditions, that the adventurers should pay to the Crown\r\na fifth of the produce of all gold and silver mines. See Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife of Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. pp. 18-66.] [Footnote b: A large portion\r\nof the adventurers, says Stith (\xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Virginia\xe2\x80\x9d), were\r\nunprincipled young men of family, whom their parents were glad to ship\r\noff, discharged servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and\r\nothers of the same class, people more apt to pillage and destroy than\r\nto assist the settlement, were the seditious chiefs, who easily led\r\nthis band into every kind of extravagance and excess. See for the\r\nhistory of Virginia the following works:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Virginia, from the First Settlements in the year 1624,\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Virginia,\xe2\x80\x9d by William Stith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Virginia, from the Earliest Period,\xe2\x80\x9d by Beverley.]\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ It was not till some time later that a certain number of rich English\r\ncapitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.]\r\n\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ Slavery was introduced about the year 1620 by a Dutch vessel which\r\nlanded twenty negroes on the banks of the river James. See Chalmer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the North, the same English foundation was modified by the most\r\nopposite shades of character; and here I may be allowed to enter into\r\nsome details. The two or three main ideas which constitute the basis of\r\nthe social theory of the United States were first combined in the\r\nNorthern English colonies, more generally denominated the States of New\r\nEngland. *e The principles of New England spread at first to the\r\nneighboring states; they then passed successively to the more distant\r\nones; and at length they imbued the whole Confederation. They now\r\nextend their influence beyond its limits over the whole American world.\r\nThe civilization of New England has been like a beacon lit upon a hill,\r\nwhich, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant\r\nhorizon with its glow.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ The States of New England are those situated to the east of the\r\nHudson; they are now six in number: 1, Connecticut; 2, Rhode Island; 3,\r\nMassachusetts; 4, Vermont; 5, New Hampshire; 6, Maine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation of New England was a novel spectacle, and all the\r\ncircumstances attending it were singular and original. The large\r\nmajority of colonies have been first inhabited either by men without\r\neducation and without resources, driven by their poverty and their\r\nmisconduct from the land which gave them birth, or by speculators and\r\nadventurers greedy of gain. Some settlements cannot even boast so\r\nhonorable an origin; St. Domingo was founded by buccaneers; and the\r\ncriminal courts of England originally supplied the population of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England\r\nall belonged to the more independent classes of their native country.\r\nTheir union on the soil of America at once presented the singular\r\nphenomenon of a society containing neither lords nor common people,\r\nneither rich nor poor. These men possessed, in proportion to their\r\nnumber, a greater mass of intelligence than is to be found in any\r\nEuropean nation of our own time. All, without a single exception, had\r\nreceived a good education, and many of them were known in Europe for\r\ntheir talents and their acquirements. The other colonies had been\r\nfounded by adventurers without family; the emigrants of New England\r\nbrought with them the best elements of order and morality\xe2\x80\x94they landed\r\nin the desert accompanied by their wives and children. But what most\r\nespecially distinguished them was the aim of their undertaking. They\r\nhad not been obliged by necessity to leave their country; the social\r\nposition they abandoned was one to be regretted, and their means of\r\nsubsistence were certain. Nor did they cross the Atlantic to improve\r\ntheir situation or to increase their wealth; the call which summoned\r\nthem from the comforts of their homes was purely intellectual; and in\r\nfacing the inevitable sufferings of exile their object was the triumph\r\nof an idea.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the Pilgrims,\r\nbelonged to that English sect the austerity of whose principles had\r\nacquired for them the name of Puritans. Puritanism was not merely a\r\nreligious doctrine, but it corresponded in many points with the most\r\nabsolute democratic and republican theories. It was this tendency which\r\nhad aroused its most dangerous adversaries. Persecuted by the\r\nGovernment of the mother-country, and disgusted by the habits of a\r\nsociety opposed to the rigor of their own principles, the Puritans went\r\nforth to seek some rude and unfrequented part of the world, where they\r\ncould live according to their own opinions, and worship God in freedom.\r\n\r\nA few quotations will throw more light upon the spirit of these pious\r\nadventures than all we can say of them. Nathaniel Morton, *f the\r\nhistorian of the first years of the settlement, thus opens his subject:\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cNew England\xe2\x80\x99s Memorial,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 13; Boston, 1826. See also \xe2\x80\x9cHutchinson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHistory,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. ii. p. 440.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentle Reader,\xe2\x80\x94I have for some length of time looked upon it as a duty\r\nincumbent, especially on the immediate successors of those that have\r\nhad so large experience of those many memorable and signal\r\ndemonstrations of God\xe2\x80\x99s goodness, viz., the first beginners of this\r\nPlantation in New England, to commit to writing his gracious\r\ndispensations on that behalf; having so many inducements thereunto, not\r\nonely otherwise but so plentifully in the Sacred Scriptures: that so,\r\nwhat we have seen, and what our fathers have told us (Psalm lxxviii. 3,\r\n4), we may not hide from our children, showing to the generations to\r\ncome the praises of the Lord; that especially the seed of Abraham his\r\nservant, and the children of Jacob his chosen (Psalm cv. 5, 6), may\r\nremember his marvellous works in the beginning and progress of the\r\nplanting of New England, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth;\r\nhow that God brought a vine into this wilderness; that he cast out the\r\nheathen, and planted it; that he made room for it and caused it to take\r\ndeep root; and it filled the land (Psalm lxxx. 8, 9). And not onely so,\r\nbut also that he hath guided his people by his strength to his holy\r\nhabitation and planted them in the mountain of his inheritance in\r\nrespect of precious Gospel enjoyments: and that as especially God may\r\nhave the glory of all unto whom it is most due; so also some rays of\r\nglory may reach the names of those blessed Saints that were the main\r\ninstruments and the beginning of this happy enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read this opening paragraph without an involuntary\r\nfeeling of religious awe; it breathes the very savor of Gospel\r\nantiquity. The sincerity of the author heightens his power of language.\r\nThe band which to his eyes was a mere party of adventurers gone forth\r\nto seek their fortune beyond seas appears to the reader as the germ of\r\na great nation wafted by Providence to a predestined shore.\r\n\r\nThe author thus continues his narrative of the departure of the first\r\npilgrims:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they left that goodly and pleasant city of Leyden, *g which had\r\nbeen their resting-place for above eleven years; but they knew that\r\nthey were pilgrims and strangers here below, and looked not much on\r\nthese things, but lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their dearest\r\ncountry, where God hath prepared for them a city (Heb. xi. 16), and\r\ntherein quieted their spirits. When they came to Delfs-Haven they found\r\nthe ship and all things ready; and such of their friends as could not\r\ncome with them followed after them, and sundry came from Amsterdam to\r\nsee them shipt, and to take their leaves of them. One night was spent\r\nwith little sleep with the most, but with friendly entertainment and\r\nChristian discourse, and other real expressions of true Christian love.\r\nThe next day they went on board, and their friends with them, where\r\ntruly doleful was the sight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear\r\nwhat sighs and sobs and prayers did sound amongst them; what tears did\r\ngush from every eye, and pithy speeches pierced each other\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nthat sundry of the Dutch strangers that stood on the Key as spectators\r\ncould not refrain from tears. But the tide (which stays for no man)\r\ncalling them away, that were thus loth to depart, their Reverend Pastor\r\nfalling down on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks\r\ncommended them with most fervent prayers unto the Lord and his\r\nblessing; and then, with mutual embraces and many tears they took their\r\nleaves one of another, which proved to be the last leave to many of\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ The emigrants were, for the most part, godly Christians from the\r\nNorth of England, who had quitted their native country because they\r\nwere \xe2\x80\x9cstudious of reformation, and entered into covenant to walk with\r\none another according to the primitive pattern of the Word of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThey emigrated to Holland, and settled in the city of Leyden in 1610,\r\nwhere they abode, being lovingly respected by the Dutch, for many\r\nyears: they left it in 1620 for several reasons, the last of which was,\r\nthat their posterity would in a few generations become Dutch, and so\r\nlose their interest in the English nation; they being desirous rather\r\nto enlarge His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s dominions, and to live under their natural\r\nprince.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emigrants were about 150 in number, including the women and the\r\nchildren. Their object was to plant a colony on the shores of the\r\nHudson; but after having been driven about for some time in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, they were forced to land on that arid coast of New\r\nEngland which is now the site of the town of Plymouth. The rock is\r\nstill shown on which the pilgrims disembarked. *h\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ This rock is become an object of veneration in the United States. I\r\nhave seen bits of it carefully preserved in several towns of the Union.\r\nDoes not this sufficiently show how entirely all human power and\r\ngreatness is in the soul of man? Here is a stone which the feet of a\r\nfew outcasts pressed for an instant, and this stone becomes famous; it\r\nis treasured by a great nation, its very dust is shared as a relic: and\r\nwhat is become of the gateways of a thousand palaces?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut before we pass on,\xe2\x80\x9d continues our historian, \xe2\x80\x9clet the reader with\r\nme make a pause and seriously consider this poor people\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\ncondition, the more to be raised up to admiration of God\xe2\x80\x99s goodness\r\ntowards them in their preservation: for being now passed the vast\r\nocean, and a sea of troubles before them in expectation, they had now\r\nno friends to welcome them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no\r\nhouses, or much less towns to repair unto to seek for succour: and for\r\nthe season it was winter, and they that know the winters of the country\r\nknow them to be sharp and violent, subject to cruel and fierce storms,\r\ndangerous to travel to known places, much more to search unknown\r\ncoasts. Besides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate\r\nwilderness, full of wilde beasts, and wilde men? and what multitudes of\r\nthem there were, they then knew not: for which way soever they turned\r\ntheir eyes (save upward to Heaven) they could have but little solace or\r\ncontent in respect of any outward object; for summer being ended, all\r\nthings stand in appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole\r\ncountry full of woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hew;\r\nif they looked behind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had\r\npassed, and was now as a main bar or gulph to separate them from all\r\nthe civil parts of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that the piety of the Puritans was of a merely\r\nspeculative kind, or that it took no cognizance of the course of\r\nworldly affairs. Puritanism, as I have already remarked, was scarcely\r\nless a political than a religious doctrine. No sooner had the emigrants\r\nlanded on the barren coast described by Nathaniel Morton than it was\r\ntheir first care to constitute a society, by passing the following Act:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God. Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal\r\nsubjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, etc., etc., Having\r\nundertaken for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian\r\nFaith, and the honour of our King and country, a voyage to plant the\r\nfirst colony in the northern parts of Virginia; Do by these presents\r\nsolemnly and mutually, in the presence of God and one another, covenant\r\nand combine ourselves together into a civil body politick, for our\r\nbetter ordering and preservation, and furtherance of the ends\r\naforesaid: and by virtue hereof do enact, constitute and frame such\r\njust and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions, and officers,\r\nfrom time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the\r\ngeneral good of the Colony: unto which we promise all due submission\r\nand obedience,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. *i\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ The emigrants who founded the State of Rhode Island in 1638, those\r\nwho landed at New Haven in 1637, the first settlers in Connecticut in\r\n1639, and the founders of Providence in 1640, began in like manner by\r\ndrawing up a social contract, which was acceded to by all the\r\ninterested parties. See \xe2\x80\x9cPitkin\xe2\x80\x99s History,\xe2\x80\x9d pp. 42 and 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis happened in 1620, and from that time forwards the emigration went\r\non. The religious and political passions which ravaged the British\r\nEmpire during the whole reign of Charles I drove fresh crowds of\r\nsectarians every year to the shores of America. In England the\r\nstronghold of Puritanism was in the middle classes, and it was from the\r\nmiddle classes that the majority of the emigrants came. The population\r\nof New England increased rapidly; and whilst the hierarchy of rank\r\ndespotically classed the inhabitants of the mother-country, the colony\r\ncontinued to present the novel spectacle of a community homogeneous in\r\nall its parts. A democracy, more perfect than any which antiquity had\r\ndreamt of, started in full size and panoply from the midst of an\r\nancient feudal society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter II: Origin Of The Anglo-Americans\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Government was not dissatisfied with an emigration which\r\nremoved the elements of fresh discord and of further revolutions. On\r\nthe contrary, everything was done to encourage it, and great exertions\r\nwere made to mitigate the hardships of those who sought a shelter from\r\nthe rigor of their country\xe2\x80\x99s laws on the soil of America. It seemed as\r\nif New England was a region given up to the dreams of fancy and the\r\nunrestrained experiments of innovators.\r\n\r\nThe English colonies (and this is one of the main causes of their\r\nprosperity) have always enjoyed more internal freedom and more\r\npolitical independence than the colonies of other nations; but this\r\nprinciple of liberty was nowhere more extensively applied than in the\r\nStates of New England.\r\n\r\nIt was generally allowed at that period that the territories of the New\r\nWorld belonged to that European nation which had been the first to\r\ndiscover them. Nearly the whole coast of North America thus became a\r\nBritish possession towards the end of the sixteenth century. The means\r\nused by the English Government to people these new domains were of\r\nseveral kinds; the King sometimes appointed a governor of his own\r\nchoice, who ruled a portion of the New World in the name and under the\r\nimmediate orders of the Crown; *j this is the colonial system adopted\r\nby other countries of Europe. Sometimes grants of certain tracts were\r\nmade by the Crown to an individual or to a company, *k in which case\r\nall the civil and political power fell into the hands of one or more\r\npersons, who, under the inspection and control of the Crown, sold the\r\nlands and governed the inhabitants. Lastly, a third system consisted in\r\nallowing a certain number of emigrants to constitute a political\r\nsociety under the protection of the mother-country, and to govern\r\nthemselves in whatever was not contrary to her laws. This mode of\r\ncolonization, so remarkably favorable to liberty, was only adopted in\r\nNew England. *l\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ This was the case in the State of New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were in this\r\nsituation.

These principles were more fully acted upon\r\nin the North than in the South, but they existed everywhere.]\r\n\r\nIn 1628 *m a charter of this kind was granted by Charles I to the\r\nemigrants who went to form the colony of Massachusetts. But, in\r\ngeneral, charters were not given to the colonies of New England till\r\nthey had acquired a certain existence. Plymouth, Providence, New Haven,\r\nthe State of Connecticut, and that of Rhode Island *n were founded\r\nwithout the co-operation and almost without the knowledge of the\r\nmother-country. The new settlers did not derive their incorporation\r\nfrom the seat of the empire, although they did not deny its supremacy;\r\nthey constituted a society of their own accord, and it was not till\r\nthirty or forty years afterwards, under Charles II. that their\r\nexistence was legally recognized by a royal charter.\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cPitkin\xe2\x80\x99s History,\xe2\x80\x9d p, 35.

They\r\nexercised the rights of sovereignty; they named their magistrates,\r\nconcluded peace or declared war, made police regulations, and enacted\r\nlaws as if their allegiance was due only to God. *o Nothing can be more\r\ncurious and, at the same time more instructive, than the legislation of\r\nthat period; it is there that the solution of the great social problem\r\nwhich the United States now present to the world is to be found.\r\n\r\no\r\n[ The inhabitants of Massachusetts had deviated from the forms which\r\nare preserved in the criminal and civil procedure of England; in 1650\r\nthe decrees of justice were not yet headed by the royal style.

Blasphemy, sorcery,\r\nadultery, *r and rape were punished with death; an outrage offered by a\r\nson to his parents was to be expiated by the same penalty. The\r\nlegislation of a rude and half-civilized people was thus applied to an\r\nenlightened and moral community. The consequence was that the\r\npunishment of death was never more frequently prescribed by the\r\nstatute, and never more rarely enforced towards the guilty.\r\n\r\np\r\n[ Code of 1650, p. 28; Hartford, 1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ See also in \xe2\x80\x9cHutchinson\xe2\x80\x99s History,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. pp. 435, 456, the\r\nanalysis of the penal code adopted in 1648 by the Colony of\r\nMassachusetts: this code is drawn up on the same principles as that of\r\nConnecticut.]\r\n\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ Adultery was also punished with death by the law of Massachusetts:\r\nand Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 441, says that several persons actually\r\nsuffered for this crime. He quotes a curious anecdote on this subject,\r\nwhich occurred in the year 1663. A married woman had had criminal\r\nintercourse with a young man; her husband died, and she married the\r\nlover. Several years had elapsed, when the public began to suspect the\r\nprevious intercourse of this couple: they were thrown into prison, put\r\nupon trial, and very narrowly escaped capital punishment.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief care of the legislators, in this body of penal laws, was the\r\nmaintenance of orderly conduct and good morals in the community: they\r\nconstantly invaded the domain of conscience, and there was scarcely a\r\nsin which was not subject to magisterial censure. The reader is aware\r\nof the rigor with which these laws punished rape and adultery;\r\nintercourse between unmarried persons was likewise severely repressed.\r\nThe judge was empowered to inflict a pecuniary penalty, a whipping, or\r\nmarriage *s on the misdemeanants; and if the records of the old courts\r\nof New Haven may be believed, prosecutions of this kind were not\r\nunfrequent. We find a sentence bearing date the first of May, 1660,\r\ninflicting a fine and reprimand on a young woman who was accused of\r\nusing improper language, and of allowing herself to be kissed. *t The\r\nCode of 1650 abounds in preventive measures. It punishes idleness and\r\ndrunkenness with severity. *u Innkeepers are forbidden to furnish more\r\nthan a certain quantity of liquor to each consumer; and simple lying,\r\nwhenever it may be injurious, *v is checked by a fine or a flogging. In\r\nother places, the legislator, entirely forgetting the great principles\r\nof religious toleration which he had himself upheld in Europe, renders\r\nattendance on divine service compulsory, *w and goes so far as to visit\r\nwith severe punishment, ** and even with death, the Christians who\r\nchose to worship God according to a ritual differing from his own. *x\r\nSometimes indeed the zeal of his enactments induces him to descend to\r\nthe most frivolous particulars: thus a law is to be found in the same\r\nCode which prohibits the use of tobacco. *y It must not be forgotten\r\nthat these fantastical and vexatious laws were not imposed by\r\nauthority, but that they were freely voted by all the persons\r\ninterested, and that the manners of the community were even more\r\naustere and more puritanical than the laws. In 1649 a solemn\r\nassociation was formed in Boston to check the worldly luxury of long\r\nhair. *z\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ Code of 1650, p. 48.

In strict connection with this penal legislation, which\r\nbears such striking marks of a narrow sectarian spirit, and of those\r\nreligious passions which had been warmed by persecution and were still\r\nfermenting among the people, a body of political laws is to be found,\r\nwhich, though written two hundred years ago, is still ahead of the\r\nliberties of our age. The general principles which are the groundwork\r\nof modern constitutions\xe2\x80\x94principles which were imperfectly known in\r\nEurope, and not completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the\r\nseventeenth century\xe2\x80\x94were all recognized and determined by the laws of\r\nNew England: the intervention of the people in public affairs, the free\r\nvoting of taxes, the responsibility of authorities, personal liberty,\r\nand trial by jury, were all positively established without discussion.\r\nFrom these fruitful principles consequences have been derived and\r\napplications have been made such as no nation in Europe has yet\r\nventured to attempt.\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut the electoral body consisted, from its origin, of the\r\nwhole number of citizens; and this is readily to be understood, *a when\r\nwe recollect that this people enjoyed an almost perfect equality of\r\nfortune, and a still greater uniformity of opinions. *b In Connecticut,\r\nat this period, all the executive functionaries were elected, including\r\nthe Governor of the State. *c The citizens above the age of sixteen\r\nwere obliged to bear arms; they formed a national militia, which\r\nappointed its own officers, and was to hold itself at all times in\r\nreadiness to march for the defence of the country. *d\r\n\r\na\r\n[ Constitution of 1638, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ In 1641 the General Assembly of Rhode Island unanimously declared\r\nthat the government of the State was a democracy, and that the power\r\nwas vested in the body of free citizens, who alone had the right to\r\nmake the laws and to watch their execution.\xe2\x80\x94Code of 1650, p. 70.]\r\n\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cPitkin\xe2\x80\x99s History,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ Constitution of 1638, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the laws of Connecticut, as well as in all those of New England, we\r\nfind the germ and gradual development of that township independence\r\nwhich is the life and mainspring of American liberty at the present\r\nday. The political existence of the majority of the nations of Europe\r\ncommenced in the superior ranks of society, and was gradually and\r\nimperfectly communicated to the different members of the social body.\r\nIn America, on the other hand, it may be said that the township was\r\norganized before the county, the county before the State, the State\r\nbefore the Union. In New England townships were completely and\r\ndefinitively constituted as early as 1650. The independence of the\r\ntownship was the nucleus round which the local interests, passions,\r\nrights, and duties collected and clung. It gave scope to the activity\r\nof a real political life most thoroughly democratic and republican. The\r\ncolonies still recognized the supremacy of the mother-country; monarchy\r\nwas still the law of the State; but the republic was already\r\nestablished in every township. The towns named their own magistrates of\r\nevery kind, rated themselves, and levied their own taxes. *e In the\r\nparish of New England the law of representation was not adopted, but\r\nthe affairs of the community were discussed, as at Athens, in the\r\nmarket-place, by a general assembly of the citizens.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ Code of 1650, p. 80.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn studying the laws which were promulgated at this first era of the\r\nAmerican republics, it is impossible not to be struck by the remarkable\r\nacquaintance with the science of government and the advanced theory of\r\nlegislation which they display. The ideas there formed of the duties of\r\nsociety towards its members are evidently much loftier and more\r\ncomprehensive than those of the European legislators at that time:\r\nobligations were there imposed which were elsewhere slighted. In the\r\nStates of New England, from the first, the condition of the poor was\r\nprovided for; *f strict measures were taken for the maintenance of\r\nroads, and surveyors were appointed to attend to them; *g registers\r\nwere established in every parish, in which the results of public\r\ndeliberations, and the births, deaths, and marriages of the citizens\r\nwere entered; *h clerks were directed to keep these registers; *i\r\nofficers were charged with the administration of vacant inheritances,\r\nand with the arbitration of litigated landmarks; and many others were\r\ncreated whose chief functions were the maintenance of public order in\r\nthe community. *j The law enters into a thousand useful provisions for\r\na number of social wants which are at present very inadequately felt in\r\nFrance.

Schools of a superior kind were founded\r\nin the same manner in the more populous districts. The municipal\r\nauthorities were bound to enforce the sending of children to school by\r\ntheir parents; they were empowered to inflict fines upon all who\r\nrefused compliance; and in case of continued resistance society assumed\r\nthe place of the parent, took possession of the child, and deprived the\r\nfather of those natural rights which he used to so bad a purpose. The\r\nreader will undoubtedly have remarked the preamble of these enactments:\r\nin America religion is the road to knowledge, and the observance of the\r\ndivine laws leads man to civil freedom.\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ Ibid., p. 90.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, after having cast a rapid glance over the state of American society\r\nin 1650, we turn to the condition of Europe, and more especially to\r\nthat of the Continent, at the same period, we cannot fail to be struck\r\nwith astonishment. On the Continent of Europe, at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, absolute monarchy had everywhere triumphed over\r\nthe ruins of the oligarchical and feudal liberties of the Middle Ages.\r\nNever were the notions of right more completely confounded than in the\r\nmidst of the splendor and literature of Europe; never was there less\r\npolitical activity among the people; never were the principles of true\r\nfreedom less widely circulated; and at that very time those principles,\r\nwhich were scorned or unknown by the nations of Europe, were proclaimed\r\nin the deserts of the New World, and were accepted as the future creed\r\nof a great people. The boldest theories of the human reason were put\r\ninto practice by a community so humble that not a statesman\r\ncondescended to attend to it; and a legislation without a precedent was\r\nproduced offhand by the imagination of the citizens. In the bosom of\r\nthis obscure democracy, which had as yet brought forth neither\r\ngenerals, nor philosophers, nor authors, a man might stand up in the\r\nface of a free people and pronounce the following fine definition of\r\nliberty. *l\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ Mather\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMagnalia Christi Americana,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. ii. p. 13.

But there is a civil, a moral, a\r\nfederal liberty which is the proper end and object of authority; it is\r\na liberty for that only which is just and good: for this liberty you\r\nare to stand with the hazard of your very lives and whatsoever crosses\r\nit is not authority, but a distemper thereof. This liberty is\r\nmaintained in a way of subjection to authority; and the authority set\r\nover you will, in all administrations for your good, be quietly\r\nsubmitted unto by all but such as have a disposition to shake off the\r\nyoke and lose their true liberty, by their murmuring at the honor and\r\npower of authority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of\r\nAnglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the result (and\r\nthis should be constantly present to the mind of two distinct\r\nelements), which in other places have been in frequent hostility, but\r\nwhich in America have been admirably incorporated and combined with one\r\nanother. I allude to the spirit of Religion and the spirit of Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians and\r\ndaring innovators. Narrow as the limits of some of their religious\r\nopinions were, they were entirely free from political prejudices. Hence\r\narose two tendencies, distinct but not opposite, which are constantly\r\ndiscernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the country.\r\n\r\nIt might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their\r\nfamily, and their native land to a religious conviction were absorbed\r\nin the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at\r\nso dear a rate. The energy, however, with which they strove for the\r\nacquirement of wealth, moral enjoyment, and the comforts as well as\r\nliberties of the world, is scarcely inferior to that with which they\r\ndevoted themselves to Heaven.\r\n\r\nPolitical principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded\r\nand altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the society in which\r\nthey were born were broken down before them; the old principles which\r\nhad governed the world for ages were no more; a path without a turn and\r\na field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent\r\ncuriosity of man: but at the limits of the political world he checks\r\nhis researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable\r\nfaculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate, but carefully\r\nabstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with\r\nsubmissive respect to truths which he will not discuss. Thus, in the\r\nmoral world everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in\r\nthe political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and disputed: in\r\nthe one is a passive, though a voluntary, obedience; in the other an\r\nindependence scornful of experience and jealous of authority.\r\n\r\nThese two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from\r\nconflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each other.\r\nReligion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the\r\nfaculties of man, and that the political world is a field prepared by\r\nthe Creator for the efforts of the intelligence. Contented with the\r\nfreedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the\r\nplace which it occupies, the empire of religion is never more surely\r\nestablished than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by\r\naught beside its native strength. Religion is no less the companion of\r\nliberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy,\r\nand the divine source of its claims. The safeguard of morality is\r\nreligion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest\r\npledge of freedom. *m\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ See Appendix, F.]\r\n\r\n\r\nReasons Of Certain Anomalies Which The Laws And Customs Of The\r\nAnglo-Americans Present\r\n\r\nRemains of aristocratic institutions in the midst of a complete\r\ndemocracy\xe2\x80\x94Why?\xe2\x80\x94Distinction carefully to be drawn between what is of\r\nPuritanical and what is of English origin.\r\n\r\nThe reader is cautioned not to draw too general or too absolute an\r\ninference from what has been said. The social condition, the religion,\r\nand the manners of the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense\r\ninfluence on the destiny of their new country. Nevertheless they were\r\nnot in a situation to found a state of things solely dependent on\r\nthemselves: no man can entirely shake off the influence of the past,\r\nand the settlers, intentionally or involuntarily, mingled habits and\r\nnotions derived from their education and from the traditions of their\r\ncountry with those habits and notions which were exclusively their own.\r\nTo form a judgment on the Anglo-Americans of the present day it is\r\ntherefore necessary to distinguish what is of Puritanical and what is\r\nof English origin.\r\n\r\nLaws and customs are frequently to be met with in the United States\r\nwhich contrast strongly with all that surrounds them. These laws seem\r\nto be drawn up in a spirit contrary to the prevailing tenor of the\r\nAmerican legislation; and these customs are no less opposed to the tone\r\nof society. If the English colonies had been founded in an age of\r\ndarkness, or if their origin was already lost in the lapse of years,\r\nthe problem would be insoluble.\r\n\r\nI shall quote a single example to illustrate what I advance. The civil\r\nand criminal procedure of the Americans has only two means of\r\naction\xe2\x80\x94committal and bail. The first measure taken by the magistrate is\r\nto exact security from the defendant, or, in case of refusal, to\r\nincarcerate him: the ground of the accusation and the importance of the\r\ncharges against him are then discussed. It is evident that a\r\nlegislation of this kind is hostile to the poor man, and favorable only\r\nto the rich. The poor man has not always a security to produce, even in\r\na civil cause; and if he is obliged to wait for justice in prison, he\r\nis speedily reduced to distress. The wealthy individual, on the\r\ncontrary, always escapes imprisonment in civil causes; nay, more, he\r\nmay readily elude the punishment which awaits him for a delinquency by\r\nbreaking his bail. So that all the penalties of the law are, for him,\r\nreducible to fines. *n Nothing can be more aristocratic than this\r\nsystem of legislation. Yet in America it is the poor who make the law,\r\nand they usually reserve the greatest social advantages to themselves.\r\nThe explanation of the phenomenon is to be found in England; the laws\r\nof which I speak are English, *o and the Americans have retained them,\r\nhowever repugnant they may be to the tenor of their legislation and the\r\nmass of their ideas. Next to its habits, the thing which a nation is\r\nleast apt to change is its civil legislation. Civil laws are only\r\nfamiliarly known to legal men, whose direct interest it is to maintain\r\nthem as they are, whether good or bad, simply because they themselves\r\nare conversant with them. The body of the nation is scarcely acquainted\r\nwith them; it merely perceives their action in particular cases; but it\r\nhas some difficulty in seizing their tendency, and obeys them without\r\npremeditation. I have quoted one instance where it would have been easy\r\nto adduce a great number of others. The surface of American society is,\r\nif I may use the expression, covered with a layer of democracy, from\r\nbeneath which the old aristocratic colors sometimes peep.\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ Crimes no doubt exist for which bail is inadmissible, but they are\r\nfew in number.]\r\n\r\n\r\no\r\n[ See Blackstone; and Delolme, book I chap. x.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter III: Social Conditions Of The Anglo-Americans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nA Social condition is commonly the result of circumstances, sometimes\r\nof laws, oftener still of these two causes united; but wherever it\r\nexists, it may justly be considered as the source of almost all the\r\nlaws, the usages, and the ideas which regulate the conduct of nations;\r\nwhatever it does not produce it modifies.

The social condition of the Americans is\r\neminently democratic; this was its character at the foundation of the\r\nColonies, and is still more strongly marked at the present day. I have\r\nstated in the preceding chapter that great equality existed among the\r\nemigrants who settled on the shores of New England. The germ of\r\naristocracy was never planted in that part of the Union. The only\r\ninfluence which obtained there was that of intellect; the people were\r\nused to reverence certain names as the emblems of knowledge and virtue.\r\nSome of their fellow-citizens acquired a power over the rest which\r\nmight truly have been called aristocratic, if it had been capable of\r\ntransmission from father to son.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things to the east of the Hudson: to the\r\nsouth-west of that river, and in the direction of the Floridas, the\r\ncase was different. In most of the States situated to the south-west of\r\nthe Hudson some great English proprietors had settled, who had imported\r\nwith them aristocratic principles and the English law of descent. I\r\nhave explained the reasons why it was impossible ever to establish a\r\npowerful aristocracy in America; these reasons existed with less force\r\nto the south-west of the Hudson. In the South, one man, aided by\r\nslaves, could cultivate a great extent of country: it was therefore\r\ncommon to see rich landed proprietors. But their influence was not\r\naltogether aristocratic as that term is understood in Europe, since\r\nthey possessed no privileges; and the cultivation of their estates\r\nbeing carried on by slaves, they had no tenants depending on them, and\r\nconsequently no patronage. Still, the great proprietors south of the\r\nHudson constituted a superior class, having ideas and tastes of its\r\nown, and forming the centre of political action. This kind of\r\naristocracy sympathized with the body of the people, whose passions and\r\ninterests it easily embraced; but it was too weak and too short-lived\r\nto excite either love or hatred for itself. This was the class which\r\nheaded the insurrection in the South, and furnished the best leaders of\r\nthe American revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which we are now speaking society was shaken to its\r\ncentre: the people, in whose name the struggle had taken place,\r\nconceived the desire of exercising the authority which it had acquired;\r\nits democratic tendencies were awakened; and having thrown off the yoke\r\nof the mother-country, it aspired to independence of every kind. The\r\ninfluence of individuals gradually ceased to be felt, and custom and\r\nlaw united together to produce the same result.\r\n\r\nBut the law of descent was the last step to equality. I am surprised\r\nthat ancient and modern jurists have not attributed to this law a\r\ngreater influence on human affairs. *a It is true that these laws\r\nbelong to civil affairs; but they ought nevertheless to be placed at\r\nthe head of all political institutions; for, whilst political laws are\r\nonly the symbol of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s condition, they exercise an incredible\r\ninfluence upon its social state. They have, moreover, a sure and\r\nuniform manner of operating upon society, affecting, as it were,\r\ngenerations yet unborn.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ I understand by the law of descent all those laws whose principal\r\nobject is to regulate the distribution of property after the death of\r\nits owner. The law of entail is of this number; it certainly prevents\r\nthe owner from disposing of his possessions before his death; but this\r\nis solely with the view of preserving them entire for the heir. The\r\nprincipal object, therefore, of the law of entail is to regulate the\r\ndescent of property after the death of its owner: its other provisions\r\nare merely means to this end.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough their means man acquires a kind of preternatural power over the\r\nfuture lot of his fellow-creatures. When the legislator has regulated\r\nthe law of inheritance, he may rest from his labor. The machine once\r\nput in motion will go on for ages, and advance, as if self-guided,\r\ntowards a given point. When framed in a particular manner, this law\r\nunites, draws together, and vests property and power in a few hands:\r\nits tendency is clearly aristocratic. On opposite principles its action\r\nis still more rapid; it divides, distributes, and disperses both\r\nproperty and power. Alarmed by the rapidity of its progress, those who\r\ndespair of arresting its motion endeavor to obstruct it by difficulties\r\nand impediments; they vainly seek to counteract its effect by contrary\r\nefforts; but it gradually reduces or destroys every obstacle, until by\r\nits incessant activity the bulwarks of the influence of wealth are\r\nground down to the fine and shifting sand which is the basis of\r\ndemocracy. When the law of inheritance permits, still more when it\r\ndecrees, the equal division of a father\xe2\x80\x99s property amongst all his\r\nchildren, its effects are of two kinds: it is important to distinguish\r\nthem from each other, although they tend to the same end.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the law of partible inheritance, the death of every\r\nproprietor brings about a kind of revolution in property; not only do\r\nhis possessions change hands, but their very nature is altered, since\r\nthey are parcelled into shares, which become smaller and smaller at\r\neach division. This is the direct and, as it were, the physical effect\r\nof the law. It follows, then, that in countries where equality of\r\ninheritance is established by law, property, and especially landed\r\nproperty, must have a tendency to perpetual diminution. The effects,\r\nhowever, of such legislation would only be perceptible after a lapse of\r\ntime, if the law was abandoned to its own working; for supposing the\r\nfamily to consist of two children (and in a country people as France is\r\nthe average number is not above three), these children, sharing amongst\r\nthem the fortune of both parents, would not be poorer than their father\r\nor mother.\r\n\r\nBut the law of equal division exercises its influence not merely upon\r\nthe property itself, but it affects the minds of the heirs, and brings\r\ntheir passions into play. These indirect consequences tend powerfully\r\nto the destruction of large fortunes, and especially of large domains.\r\nAmong nations whose law of descent is founded upon the right of\r\nprimogeniture landed estates often pass from generation to generation\r\nwithout undergoing division, the consequence of which is that family\r\nfeeling is to a certain degree incorporated with the estate. The family\r\nrepresents the estate, the estate the family; whose name, together with\r\nits origin, its glory, its power, and its virtues, is thus perpetuated\r\nin an imperishable memorial of the past and a sure pledge of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhen the equal partition of property is established by law, the\r\nintimate connection is destroyed between family feeling and the\r\npreservation of the paternal estate; the property ceases to represent\r\nthe family; for as it must inevitably be divided after one or two\r\ngenerations, it has evidently a constant tendency to diminish, and must\r\nin the end be completely dispersed. The sons of the great landed\r\nproprietor, if they are few in number, or if fortune befriends them,\r\nmay indeed entertain the hope of being as wealthy as their father, but\r\nnot that of possessing the same property as he did; the riches must\r\nnecessarily be composed of elements different from his.\r\n\r\nNow, from the moment that you divest the landowner of that interest in\r\nthe preservation of his estate which he derives from association, from\r\ntradition, and from family pride, you may be certain that sooner or\r\nlater he will dispose of it; for there is a strong pecuniary interest\r\nin favor of selling, as floating capital produces higher interest than\r\nreal property, and is more readily available to gratify the passions of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nGreat landed estates which have once been divided never come together\r\nagain; for the small proprietor draws from his land a better revenue,\r\nin proportion, than the large owner does from his, and of course he\r\nsells it at a higher rate. *b The calculations of gain, therefore,\r\nwhich decide the rich man to sell his domain will still more powerfully\r\ninfluence him against buying small estates to unite them into a large\r\none.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ I do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates his land\r\nbetter, but he cultivates it with more ardor and care; so that he makes\r\nup by his labor for his want of skill.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is called family pride is often founded upon an illusion of\r\nself-love. A man wishes to perpetuate and immortalize himself, as it\r\nwere, in his great-grandchildren. Where the esprit de famille ceases to\r\nact individual selfishness comes into play. When the idea of family\r\nbecomes vague, indeterminate, and uncertain, a man thinks of his\r\npresent convenience; he provides for the establishment of his\r\nsucceeding generation, and no more. Either a man gives up the idea of\r\nperpetuating his family, or at any rate he seeks to accomplish it by\r\nother means than that of a landed estate. Thus not only does the law of\r\npartible inheritance render it difficult for families to preserve their\r\nancestral domains entire, but it deprives them of the inclination to\r\nattempt it, and compels them in some measure to co-operate with the law\r\nin their own extinction.\r\n\r\nThe law of equal distribution proceeds by two methods: by acting upon\r\nthings, it acts upon persons; by influencing persons, it affects\r\nthings. By these means the law succeeds in striking at the root of\r\nlanded property, and dispersing rapidly both families and fortunes. *c\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ Land being the most stable kind of property, we find, from time to\r\ntime, rich individuals who are disposed to make great sacrifices in\r\norder to obtain it, and who willingly forfeit a considerable part of\r\ntheir income to make sure of the rest. But these are accidental cases.\r\nThe preference for landed property is no longer found habitually in any\r\nclass but among the poor. The small landowner, who has less\r\ninformation, less imagination, and fewer passions than the great one,\r\nis generally occupied with the desire of increasing his estate: and it\r\noften happens that by inheritance, by marriage, or by the chances of\r\ntrade, he is gradually furnished with the means. Thus, to balance the\r\ntendency which leads men to divide their estates, there exists another,\r\nwhich incites them to add to them. This tendency, which is sufficient\r\nto prevent estates from being divided ad infinitum, is not strong\r\nenough to create great territorial possessions, certainly not to keep\r\nthem up in the same family.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMost certainly it is not for us Frenchmen of the nineteenth century,\r\nwho daily witness the political and social changes which the law of\r\npartition is bringing to pass, to question its influence. It is\r\nperpetually conspicuous in our country, overthrowing the walls of our\r\ndwellings and removing the landmarks of our fields. But although it has\r\nproduced great effects in France, much still remains for it to do. Our\r\nrecollections, opinions, and habits present powerful obstacles to its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIn the United States it has nearly completed its work of destruction,\r\nand there we can best study its results. The English laws concerning\r\nthe transmission of property were abolished in almost all the States at\r\nthe time of the Revolution. The law of entail was so modified as not to\r\ninterrupt the free circulation of property. *d The first generation\r\nhaving passed away, estates began to be parcelled out, and the change\r\nbecame more and more rapid with the progress of time. At this moment,\r\nafter a lapse of a little more than sixty years, the aspect of society\r\nis totally altered; the families of the great landed proprietors are\r\nalmost all commingled with the general mass. In the State of New York,\r\nwhich formerly contained many of these, there are but two who still\r\nkeep their heads above the stream, and they must shortly disappear. The\r\nsons of these opulent citizens are become merchants, lawyers, or\r\nphysicians. Most of them have lapsed into obscurity. The last trace of\r\nhereditary ranks and distinctions is destroyed\xe2\x80\x94the law of partition has\r\nreduced all to one level. [Footnote d: See Appendix, G.]\r\n\r\nI do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in\r\nthe United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of\r\nmoney has taken stronger hold on the affections of men, and where the\r\nprofounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent\r\nequality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable\r\nrapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding\r\ngenerations in the full enjoyment of it.\r\n\r\nThis picture, which may perhaps be thought to be overcharged, still\r\ngives a very imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new States\r\nof the West and South-west. At the end of the last century a few bold\r\nadventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and\r\nthe mass of the population very soon began to move in that direction:\r\ncommunities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the wilds:\r\nStates whose names were not in existence a few years before claimed\r\ntheir place in the American Union; and in the Western settlements we\r\nmay behold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme. In these States,\r\nfounded off-hand, and, as it were, by chance, the inhabitants are but\r\nof yesterday. Scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors are\r\nignorant of each other\xe2\x80\x99s history. In this part of the American\r\ncontinent, therefore, the population has not experienced the influence\r\nof great names and great wealth, nor even that of the natural\r\naristocracy of knowledge and virtue. None are there to wield that\r\nrespectable power which men willingly grant to the remembrance of a\r\nlife spent in doing good before their eyes. The new States of the West\r\nare already inhabited, but society has no existence among them. *e\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ This may have been true in 1832, but is not so in 1874, when great\r\ncities like Chicago and San Francisco have sprung up in the Western\r\nStates. But as yet the Western States exert no powerful influence on\r\nAmerican society.\xe2\x80\x94-Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not only the fortunes of men which are equal in America; even\r\ntheir requirements partake in some degree of the same uniformity. I do\r\nnot believe that there is a country in the world where, in proportion\r\nto the population, there are so few uninstructed and at the same time\r\nso few learned individuals. Primary instruction is within the reach of\r\neverybody; superior instruction is scarcely to be obtained by any. This\r\nis not surprising; it is in fact the necessary consequence of what we\r\nhave advanced above. Almost all the Americans are in easy\r\ncircumstances, and can therefore obtain the first elements of human\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIn America there are comparatively few who are rich enough to live\r\nwithout a profession. Every profession requires an apprenticeship,\r\nwhich limits the time of instruction to the early years of life. At\r\nfifteen they enter upon their calling, and thus their education ends at\r\nthe age when ours begins. Whatever is done afterwards is with a view to\r\nsome special and lucrative object; a science is taken up as a matter of\r\nbusiness, and the only branch of it which is attended to is such as\r\nadmits of an immediate practical application. In America most of the\r\nrich men were formerly poor; most of those who now enjoy leisure were\r\nabsorbed in business during their youth; the consequence of which is,\r\nthat when they might have had a taste for study they had no time for\r\nit, and when time is at their disposal they have no longer the\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nThere is no class, then, in America, in which the taste for\r\nintellectual pleasures is transmitted with hereditary fortune and\r\nleisure, and by which the labors of the intellect are held in honor.\r\nAccordingly there is an equal want of the desire and the power of\r\napplication to these objects.\r\n\r\nA middle standard is fixed in America for human knowledge. All approach\r\nas near to it as they can; some as they rise, others as they descend.\r\nOf course, an immense multitude of persons are to be found who\r\nentertain the same number of ideas on religion, history, science,\r\npolitical economy, legislation, and government. The gifts of intellect\r\nproceed directly from God, and man cannot prevent their unequal\r\ndistribution. But in consequence of the state of things which we have\r\nhere represented it happens that, although the capacities of men are\r\nwidely different, as the Creator has doubtless intended they should be,\r\nthey are submitted to the same method of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn America the aristocratic element has always been feeble from its\r\nbirth; and if at the present day it is not actually destroyed, it is at\r\nany rate so completely disabled that we can scarcely assign to it any\r\ndegree of influence in the course of affairs. The democratic principle,\r\non the contrary, has gained so much strength by time, by events, and by\r\nlegislation, as to have become not only predominant but all-powerful.\r\nThere is no family or corporate authority, and it is rare to find even\r\nthe influence of individual character enjoy any durability.\r\n\r\nAmerica, then, exhibits in her social state a most extraordinary\r\nphenomenon. Men are there seen on a greater equality in point of\r\nfortune and intellect, or, in other words, more equal in their\r\nstrength, than in any other country of the world, or in any age of\r\nwhich history has preserved the remembrance.\r\n\r\nPolitical Consequences Of The Social Condition Of The Anglo-Americans\r\n\r\nThe political consequences of such a social condition as this are\r\neasily deducible. It is impossible to believe that equality will not\r\neventually find its way into the political world as it does everywhere\r\nelse. To conceive of men remaining forever unequal upon one single\r\npoint, yet equal on all others, is impossible; they must come in the\r\nend to be equal upon all. Now I know of only two methods of\r\nestablishing equality in the political world; every citizen must be put\r\nin possession of his rights, or rights must be granted to no one. For\r\nnations which are arrived at the same stage of social existence as the\r\nAnglo-Americans, it is therefore very difficult to discover a medium\r\nbetween the sovereignty of all and the absolute power of one man: and\r\nit would be vain to deny that the social condition which I have been\r\ndescribing is equally liable to each of these consequences.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, a manly and lawful passion for equality which\r\nexcites men to wish all to be powerful and honored. This passion tends\r\nto elevate the humble to the rank of the great; but there exists also\r\nin the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak\r\nto attempt to lower the powerful to their own level, and reduces men to\r\nprefer equality in slavery to inequality with freedom. Not that those\r\nnations whose social condition is democratic naturally despise liberty;\r\non the contrary, they have an instinctive love of it. But liberty is\r\nnot the chief and constant object of their desires; equality is their\r\nidol: they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty, and if they\r\nmiss their aim resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing\r\ncan satisfy them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve\r\nto perish.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in a State where the citizens are nearly on an\r\nequality, it becomes difficult for them to preserve their independence\r\nagainst the aggressions of power. No one among them being strong enough\r\nto engage in the struggle with advantage, nothing but a general\r\ncombination can protect their liberty. And such a union is not always\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nFrom the same social position, then, nations may derive one or the\r\nother of two great political results; these results are extremely\r\ndifferent from each other, but they may both proceed from the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans are the first nations who, having been exposed to\r\nthis formidable alternative, have been happy enough to escape the\r\ndominion of absolute power. They have been allowed by their\r\ncircumstances, their origin, their intelligence, and especially by\r\ntheir moral feeling, to establish and maintain the sovereignty of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter IV: The Principle Of The Sovereignty Of The People In America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nIt predominates over the whole of society in America\xe2\x80\x94Application made\r\nof this principle by the Americans even before their\r\nRevolution\xe2\x80\x94Development given to it by that Revolution\xe2\x80\x94Gradual and\r\nirresistible extension of the elective qualification.\r\n\r\nThe Principle Of The Sovereignty Of The People In America\r\n\r\nWhenever the political laws of the United States are to be discussed,\r\nit is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people that we must\r\nbegin. The principle of the sovereignty of the people, which is to be\r\nfound, more or less, at the bottom of almost all human institutions,\r\ngenerally remains concealed from view. It is obeyed without being\r\nrecognized, or if for a moment it be brought to light, it is hastily\r\ncast back into the gloom of the sanctuary. \xe2\x80\x9cThe will of the nation\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\none of those expressions which have been most profusely abused by the\r\nwily and the despotic of every age. To the eyes of some it has been\r\nrepresented by the venal suffrages of a few of the satellites of power;\r\nto others by the votes of a timid or an interested minority; and some\r\nhave even discovered it in the silence of a people, on the supposition\r\nthat the fact of submission established the right of command.\r\n\r\nIn America the principle of the sovereignty of the people is not either\r\nbarren or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognized\r\nby the customs and proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely, and\r\narrives without impediment at its most remote consequences. If there be\r\na country in the world where the doctrine of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople can be fairly appreciated, where it can be studied in its\r\napplication to the affairs of society, and where its dangers and its\r\nadvantages may be foreseen, that country is assuredly America.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that, from their origin, the sovereignty of the\r\npeople was the fundamental principle of the greater number of British\r\ncolonies in America. It was far, however, from then exercising as much\r\ninfluence on the government of society as it now does. Two obstacles,\r\nthe one external, the other internal, checked its invasive progress. It\r\ncould not ostensibly disclose itself in the laws of colonies which were\r\nstill constrained to obey the mother-country: it was therefore obliged\r\nto spread secretly, and to gain ground in the provincial assemblies,\r\nand especially in the townships.\r\n\r\nAmerican society was not yet prepared to adopt it with all its\r\nconsequences. The intelligence of New England, and the wealth of the\r\ncountry to the south of the Hudson (as I have shown in the preceding\r\nchapter), long exercised a sort of aristocratic influence, which tended\r\nto retain the exercise of social authority in the hands of a few. The\r\npublic functionaries were not universally elected, and the citizens\r\nwere not all of them electors. The electoral franchise was everywhere\r\nplaced within certain limits, and made dependent on a certain\r\nqualification, which was exceedingly low in the North and more\r\nconsiderable in the South.\r\n\r\nThe American revolution broke out, and the doctrine of the sovereignty\r\nof the people, which had been nurtured in the townships and\r\nmunicipalities, took possession of the State: every class was enlisted\r\nin its cause; battles were fought, and victories obtained for it, until\r\nit became the law of laws.\r\n\r\nA no less rapid change was effected in the interior of society, where\r\nthe law of descent completed the abolition of local influences.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when this consequence of the laws and of the\r\nrevolution was apparent to every eye, victory was irrevocably\r\npronounced in favor of the democratic cause. All power was, in fact, in\r\nits hands, and resistance was no longer possible. The higher orders\r\nsubmitted without a murmur and without a struggle to an evil which was\r\nthenceforth inevitable. The ordinary fate of falling powers awaited\r\nthem; each of their several members followed his own interests; and as\r\nit was impossible to wring the power from the hands of a people which\r\nthey did not detest sufficiently to brave, their only aim was to secure\r\nits good-will at any price. The most democratic laws were consequently\r\nvoted by the very men whose interests they impaired; and thus, although\r\nthe higher classes did not excite the passions of the people against\r\ntheir order, they accelerated the triumph of the new state of things;\r\nso that by a singular change the democratic impulse was found to be\r\nmost irresistible in the very States where the aristocracy had the\r\nfirmest hold. The State of Maryland, which had been founded by men of\r\nrank, was the first to proclaim universal suffrage, and to introduce\r\nthe most democratic forms into the conduct of its government.\r\n\r\nWhen a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may easily be\r\nforeseen that sooner or later that qualification will be entirely\r\nabolished. There is no more invariable rule in the history of society:\r\nthe further electoral rights are extended, the greater is the need of\r\nextending them; for after each concession the strength of the democracy\r\nincreases, and its demands increase with its strength. The ambition of\r\nthose who are below the appointed rate is irritated in exact proportion\r\nto the great number of those who are above it. The exception at last\r\nbecomes the rule, concession follows concession, and no stop can be\r\nmade short of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the principle of the sovereignty of the people has\r\nacquired, in the United States, all the practical development which the\r\nimagination can conceive. It is unencumbered by those fictions which\r\nhave been thrown over it in other countries, and it appears in every\r\npossible form according to the exigency of the occasion. Sometimes the\r\nlaws are made by the people in a body, as at Athens; and sometimes its\r\nrepresentatives, chosen by universal suffrage, transact business in its\r\nname, and almost under its immediate control.\r\n\r\nIn some countries a power exists which, though it is in a degree\r\nforeign to the social body, directs it, and forces it to pursue a\r\ncertain track. In others the ruling force is divided, being partly\r\nwithin and partly without the ranks of the people. But nothing of the\r\nkind is to be seen in the United States; there society governs itself\r\nfor itself. All power centres in its bosom; and scarcely an individual\r\nis to be meet with who would venture to conceive, or, still less, to\r\nexpress, the idea of seeking it elsewhere. The nation participates in\r\nthe making of its laws by the choice of its legislators, and in the\r\nexecution of them by the choice of the agents of the executive\r\ngovernment; it may almost be said to govern itself, so feeble and so\r\nrestricted is the share left to the administration, so little do the\r\nauthorities forget their popular origin and the power from which they\r\nemanate. *a [Footnote a: See Appendix, H.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter V: Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States Before That Of The\r\nUnion At Large.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to examine in the following chapter what is the form of\r\ngovernment established in America on the principle of the sovereignty\r\nof the people; what are its resources, its hindrances, its advantages,\r\nand its dangers. The first difficulty which presents itself arises from\r\nthe complex nature of the constitution of the United States, which\r\nconsists of two distinct social structures, connected and, as it were,\r\nencased one within the other; two governments, completely separate and\r\nalmost independent, the one fulfilling the ordinary duties and\r\nresponding to the daily and indefinite calls of a community, the other\r\ncircumscribed within certain limits, and only exercising an exceptional\r\nauthority over the general interests of the country. In short, there\r\nare twenty-four small sovereign nations, whose agglomeration\r\nconstitutes the body of the Union. To examine the Union before we have\r\nstudied the States would be to adopt a method filled with obstacles.\r\nThe form of the Federal Government of the United States was the last\r\nwhich was adopted; and it is in fact nothing more than a modification\r\nor a summary of those republican principles which were current in the\r\nwhole community before it existed, and independently of its existence.\r\nMoreover, the Federal Government is, as I have just observed, the\r\nexception; the Government of the States is the rule. The author who\r\nshould attempt to exhibit the picture as a whole before he had\r\nexplained its details would necessarily fall into obscurity and\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nThe great political principles which govern American society at this\r\nday undoubtedly took their origin and their growth in the State. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to become acquainted with the State in order to\r\npossess a clue to the remainder. The States which at present compose\r\nthe American Union all present the same features, as far as regards the\r\nexternal aspect of their institutions. Their political or\r\nadministrative existence is centred in three focuses of action, which\r\nmay not inaptly be compared to the different nervous centres which\r\nconvey motion to the human body. The township is the lowest in order,\r\nthen the county, and lastly the State; and I propose to devote the\r\nfollowing chapter to the examination of these three divisions.\r\n\r\nThe American System Of Townships And Municipal Bodies\r\n\r\nWhy the Author begins the examination of the political institutions\r\nwith the township\xe2\x80\x94Its existence in all nations\xe2\x80\x94Difficulty of\r\nestablishing and preserving municipal independence\xe2\x80\x94Its importance\xe2\x80\x94Why\r\nthe Author has selected the township system of New England as the main\r\ntopic of his discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is not undesignedly that I begin this subject with the Township. The\r\nvillage or township is the only association which is so perfectly\r\nnatural that wherever a number of men are collected it seems to\r\nconstitute itself.\r\n\r\nThe town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a community, must\r\nnecessarily exist in all nations, whatever their laws and customs may\r\nbe: if man makes monarchies and establishes republics, the first\r\nassociation of mankind seems constituted by the hand of God. But\r\nalthough the existence of the township is coeval with that of man, its\r\nliberties are not the less rarely respected and easily destroyed. A\r\nnation is always able to establish great political assemblies, because\r\nit habitually contains a certain number of individuals fitted by their\r\ntalents, if not by their habits, for the direction of affairs. The\r\ntownship is, on the contrary, composed of coarser materials, which are\r\nless easily fashioned by the legislator. The difficulties which attend\r\nthe consolidation of its independence rather augment than diminish with\r\nthe increasing enlightenment of the people. A highly civilized\r\ncommunity spurns the attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at\r\nits numerous blunders, and is apt to despair of success before the\r\nexperiment is completed. Again, no immunities are so ill protected from\r\nthe encroachments of the supreme power as those of municipal bodies in\r\ngeneral: they are unable to struggle, single-handed, against a strong\r\nor an enterprising government, and they cannot defend their cause with\r\nsuccess unless it be identified with the customs of the nation and\r\nsupported by public opinion. Thus until the independence of townships\r\nis amalgamated with the manners of a people it is easily destroyed, and\r\nit is only after a long existence in the laws that it can be thus\r\namalgamated. Municipal freedom is not the fruit of human device; it is\r\nrarely created; but it is, as it were, secretly and spontaneously\r\nengendered in the midst of a semi-barbarous state of society. The\r\nconstant action of the laws and the national habits, peculiar\r\ncircumstances, and above all time, may consolidate it; but there is\r\ncertainly no nation on the continent of Europe which has experienced\r\nits advantages. Nevertheless local assemblies of citizens constitute\r\nthe strength of free nations. Town-meetings are to liberty what primary\r\nschools are to science; they bring it within the people\xe2\x80\x99s reach, they\r\nteach men how to use and how to enjoy it. A nation may establish a\r\nsystem of free government, but without the spirit of municipal\r\ninstitutions it cannot have the spirit of liberty. The transient\r\npassions and the interests of an hour, or the chance of circumstances,\r\nmay have created the external forms of independence; but the despotic\r\ntendency which has been repelled will, sooner or later, inevitably\r\nreappear on the surface.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain to the reader the general principles on which the\r\npolitical organization of the counties and townships of the United\r\nStates rests, I have thought it expedient to choose one of the States\r\nof New England as an example, to examine the mechanism of its\r\nconstitution, and then to cast a general glance over the country. The\r\ntownship and the county are not organized in the same manner in every\r\npart of the Union; it is, however, easy to perceive that the same\r\nprinciples have guided the formation of both of them throughout the\r\nUnion. I am inclined to believe that these principles have been carried\r\nfurther in New England than elsewhere, and consequently that they offer\r\ngreater facilities to the observations of a stranger. The institutions\r\nof New England form a complete and regular whole; they have received\r\nthe sanction of time, they have the support of the laws, and the still\r\nstronger support of the manners of the community, over which they\r\nexercise the most prodigious influence; they consequently deserve our\r\nattention on every account.\r\n\r\nLimits Of The Township\r\n\r\nThe township of New England is a division which stands between the\r\ncommune and the canton of France, and which corresponds in general to\r\nthe English tithing, or town. Its average population is from two to\r\nthree thousand; *a so that, on the one hand, the interests of its\r\ninhabitants are not likely to conflict, and, on the other, men capable\r\nof conducting its affairs are always to be found among its citizens.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ In 1830 there were 305 townships in the State of Massachusetts, and\r\n610,014 inhabitants, which gives an average of about 2,000 inhabitants\r\nto each township.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthorities Of The Township In New England\r\n\r\nThe people the source of all power here as elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94Manages its own\r\naffairs\xe2\x80\x94No corporation\xe2\x80\x94The greater part of the authority vested in the\r\nhands of the Selectmen\xe2\x80\x94How the Selectmen act\xe2\x80\x94Town-meeting\xe2\x80\x94Enumeration\r\nof the public officers of the township\xe2\x80\x94Obligatory and remunerated\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nIn the township, as well as everywhere else, the people is the only\r\nsource of power; but in no stage of government does the body of\r\ncitizens exercise a more immediate influence. In America the people is\r\na master whose exigencies demand obedience to the utmost limits of\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nIn New England the majority acts by representatives in the conduct of\r\nthe public business of the State; but if such an arrangement be\r\nnecessary in general affairs, in the townships, where the legislative\r\nand administrative action of the government is in more immediate\r\ncontact with the subject, the system of representation is not adopted.\r\nThere is no corporation; but the body of electors, after having\r\ndesignated its magistrates, directs them in everything that exceeds the\r\nsimple and ordinary executive business of the State. *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ The same rules are not applicable to the great towns, which generally\r\nhave a mayor, and a corporation divided into two bodies; this, however,\r\nis an exception which requires the sanction of a law.\xe2\x80\x94See the Act of\r\nFebruary 22, 1822, for appointing the authorities of the city of\r\nBoston. It frequently happens that small towns as well as cities are\r\nsubject to a peculiar administration. In 1832, 104 townships in the\r\nState of New York were governed in this manner.\xe2\x80\x94Williams\xe2\x80\x99 Register.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis state of things is so contrary to our ideas, and so different from\r\nour customs, that it is necessary for me to adduce some examples to\r\nexplain it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe public duties in the township are extremely numerous and minutely\r\ndivided, as we shall see further on; but the larger proportion of\r\nadministrative power is vested in the hands of a small number of\r\nindividuals, called \xe2\x80\x9cthe Selectmen.\xe2\x80\x9d *c The general laws of the State\r\nimpose a certain number of obligations on the selectmen, which they may\r\nfulfil without the authorization of the body they represent, but which\r\nthey can only neglect on their own responsibility. The law of the State\r\nobliges them, for instance, to draw up the list of electors in their\r\ntownships; and if they omit this part of their functions, they are\r\nguilty of a misdemeanor. In all the affairs, however, which are\r\ndetermined by the town-meeting, the selectmen are the organs of the\r\npopular mandate, as in France the Maire executes the decree of the\r\nmunicipal council. They usually act upon their own responsibility, and\r\nmerely put in practice principles which have been previously recognized\r\nby the majority. But if any change is to be introduced in the existing\r\nstate of things, or if they wish to undertake any new enterprise, they\r\nare obliged to refer to the source of their power. If, for instance, a\r\nschool is to be established, the selectmen convoke the whole body of\r\nthe electors on a certain day at an appointed place; they explain the\r\nurgency of the case; they give their opinion on the means of satisfying\r\nit, on the probable expense, and the site which seems to be most\r\nfavorable. The meeting is consulted on these several points; it adopts\r\nthe principle, marks out the site, votes the rate, and confides the\r\nexecution of its resolution to the selectmen.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ Three selectmen are appointed in the small townships, and nine in the\r\nlarge ones. See \xe2\x80\x9cThe Town-Officer,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 186. See also the principal laws\r\nof the State of Massachusetts relative to the selectmen:\r\n\r\n\r\nAct of February 20, 1786, vol. i. p. 219; February 24, 1796, vol. i. p.\r\n488; March 7, 1801, vol. ii. p. 45; June 16, 1795, vol. i. p. 475;\r\nMarch 12, 1808, vol. ii. p. 186; February 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 302;\r\nJune 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.]\r\n\r\nThe selectmen have alone the right of calling a town-meeting, but they\r\nmay be requested to do so: if ten citizens are desirous of submitting a\r\nnew project to the assent of the township, they may demand a general\r\nconvocation of the inhabitants; the selectmen are obliged to comply,\r\nbut they have only the right of presiding at the meeting. *d\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ See Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 150, Act of March 25, 1786.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selectmen are elected every year in the month of April or of May.\r\nThe town-meeting chooses at the same time a number of other municipal\r\nmagistrates, who are entrusted with important administrative functions.\r\nThe assessors rate the township; the collectors receive the rate. A\r\nconstable is appointed to keep the peace, to watch the streets, and to\r\nforward the execution of the laws; the town-clerk records all the town\r\nvotes, orders, grants, births, deaths, and marriages; the treasurer\r\nkeeps the funds; the overseer of the poor performs the difficult task\r\nof superintending the action of the poor-laws; committee-men are\r\nappointed to attend to the schools and to public instruction; and the\r\nroad-surveyors, who take care of the greater and lesser thoroughfares\r\nof the township, complete the list of the principal functionaries. They\r\nare, however, still further subdivided; and amongst the municipal\r\nofficers are to be found parish commissioners, who audit the expenses\r\nof public worship; different classes of inspectors, some of whom are to\r\ndirect the citizens in case of fire; tithing-men, listers, haywards,\r\nchimney-viewers, fence-viewers to maintain the bounds of property,\r\ntimber-measurers, and sealers of weights and measures. *e\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ All these magistrates actually exist; their different functions are\r\nall detailed in a book called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Town-Officer,\xe2\x80\x9d by Isaac Goodwin,\r\nWorcester, 1827; and in the \xe2\x80\x9cCollection of the General Laws of\r\nMassachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d 3 vols., Boston, 1823.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are nineteen principal officers in a township. Every inhabitant\r\nis constrained, on the pain of being fined, to undertake these\r\ndifferent functions; which, however, are almost all paid, in order that\r\nthe poorer citizens may be able to give up their time without loss. In\r\ngeneral the American system is not to grant a fixed salary to its\r\nfunctionaries. Every service has its price, and they are remunerated in\r\nproportion to what they have done.\r\n\r\nExistence Of The Township\r\n\r\nEvery one the best judge of his own interest\xe2\x80\x94Corollary of the principle\r\nof the sovereignty of the people\xe2\x80\x94Application of those doctrines in the\r\ntownships of America\xe2\x80\x94The township of New England is sovereign in all\r\nthat concerns itself alone: subject to the State in all other\r\nmatters\xe2\x80\x94Bond of the township and the State\xe2\x80\x94In France the Government\r\nlends its agent to the Commune\xe2\x80\x94In America the reverse occurs.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that the principle of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople governs the whole political system of the Anglo-Americans. Every\r\npage of this book will afford new instances of the same doctrine. In\r\nthe nations by which the sovereignty of the people is recognized every\r\nindividual possesses an equal share of power, and participates alike in\r\nthe government of the State. Every individual is, therefore, supposed\r\nto be as well informed, as virtuous, and as strong as any of his\r\nfellow-citizens. He obeys the government, not because he is inferior to\r\nthe authorities which conduct it, or that he is less capable than his\r\nneighbor of governing himself, but because he acknowledges the utility\r\nof an association with his fellow-men, and because he knows that no\r\nsuch association can exist without a regulating force. If he be a\r\nsubject in all that concerns the mutual relations of citizens, he is\r\nfree and responsible to God alone for all that concerns himself. Hence\r\narises the maxim that every one is the best and the sole judge of his\r\nown private interest, and that society has no right to control a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nactions, unless they are prejudicial to the common weal, or unless the\r\ncommon weal demands his co-operation. This doctrine is universally\r\nadmitted in the United States. I shall hereafter examine the general\r\ninfluence which it exercises on the ordinary actions of life; I am now\r\nspeaking of the nature of municipal bodies.\r\n\r\nThe township, taken as a whole, and in relation to the government of\r\nthe country, may be looked upon as an individual to whom the theory I\r\nhave just alluded to is applied. Municipal independence is therefore a\r\nnatural consequence of the principle of the sovereignty of the people\r\nin the United States: all the American republics recognize it more or\r\nless; but circumstances have peculiarly favored its growth in New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn this part of the Union the impulsion of political activity was given\r\nin the townships; and it may almost be said that each of them\r\noriginally formed an independent nation. When the Kings of England\r\nasserted their supremacy, they were contented to assume the central\r\npower of the State. The townships of New England remained as they were\r\nbefore; and although they are now subject to the State, they were at\r\nfirst scarcely dependent upon it. It is important to remember that they\r\nhave not been invested with privileges, but that they have, on the\r\ncontrary, forfeited a portion of their independence to the State. The\r\ntownships are only subordinate to the State in those interests which I\r\nshall term social, as they are common to all the citizens. They are\r\nindependent in all that concerns themselves; and amongst the\r\ninhabitants of New England I believe that not a man is to be found who\r\nwould acknowledge that the State has any right to interfere in their\r\nlocal interests. The towns of New England buy and sell, sue or are\r\nsued, augment or diminish their rates, without the slightest opposition\r\non the part of the administrative authority of the State.\r\n\r\nThey are bound, however, to comply with the demands of the community.\r\nIf the State is in need of money, a town can neither give nor withhold\r\nthe supplies. If the State projects a road, the township cannot refuse\r\nto let it cross its territory; if a police regulation is made by the\r\nState, it must be enforced by the town. A uniform system of instruction\r\nis organized all over the country, and every town is bound to establish\r\nthe schools which the law ordains. In speaking of the administration of\r\nthe United States I shall have occasion to point out the means by which\r\nthe townships are compelled to obey in these different cases: I here\r\nmerely show the existence of the obligation. Strict as this obligation\r\nis, the government of the State imposes it in principle only, and in\r\nits performance the township resumes all its independent rights. Thus,\r\ntaxes are voted by the State, but they are levied and collected by the\r\ntownship; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the township\r\nbuilds, pays, and superintends it. In France the State-collector\r\nreceives the local imposts; in America the town-collector receives the\r\ntaxes of the State. Thus the French Government lends its agents to the\r\ncommune; in America the township is the agent of the Government. This\r\nfact alone shows the extent of the differences which exist between the\r\ntwo nations.\r\n\r\nPublic Spirit Of The Townships Of New England\r\n\r\nHow the township of New England wins the affections of its\r\ninhabitants\xe2\x80\x94Difficulty of creating local public spirit in Europe\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nrights and duties of the American township favorable to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94Characteristics of home in the United States\xe2\x80\x94Manifestations of\r\npublic spirit in New England\xe2\x80\x94Its happy effects.\r\n\r\nIn America, not only do municipal bodies exist, but they are kept alive\r\nand supported by public spirit. The township of New England possesses\r\ntwo advantages which infallibly secure the attentive interest of\r\nmankind, namely, independence and authority. Its sphere is indeed small\r\nand limited, but within that sphere its action is unrestrained; and its\r\nindependence gives to it a real importance which its extent and\r\npopulation may not always ensure.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the affections of men generally lie on the\r\nside of authority. Patriotism is not durable in a conquered nation. The\r\nNew Englander is attached to his township, not only because he was born\r\nin it, but because it constitutes a social body of which he is a\r\nmember, and whose government claims and deserves the exercise of his\r\nsagacity. In Europe the absence of local public spirit is a frequent\r\nsubject of regret to those who are in power; everyone agrees that there\r\nis no surer guarantee of order and tranquility, and yet nothing is more\r\ndifficult to create. If the municipal bodies were made powerful and\r\nindependent, the authorities of the nation might be disunited and the\r\npeace of the country endangered. Yet, without power and independence, a\r\ntown may contain good subjects, but it can have no active citizens.\r\nAnother important fact is that the township of New England is so\r\nconstituted as to excite the warmest of human affections, without\r\narousing the ambitious passions of the heart of man. The officers of\r\nthe country are not elected, and their authority is very limited. Even\r\nthe State is only a second-rate community, whose tranquil and obscure\r\nadministration offers no inducement sufficient to draw men away from\r\nthe circle of their interests into the turmoil of public affairs. The\r\nfederal government confers power and honor on the men who conduct it;\r\nbut these individuals can never be very numerous. The high station of\r\nthe Presidency can only be reached at an advanced period of life, and\r\nthe other federal functionaries are generally men who have been favored\r\nby fortune, or distinguished in some other career. Such cannot be the\r\npermanent aim of the ambitious. But the township serves as a centre for\r\nthe desire of public esteem, the want of exciting interests, and the\r\ntaste for authority and popularity, in the midst of the ordinary\r\nrelations of life; and the passions which commonly embroil society\r\nchange their character when they find a vent so near the domestic\r\nhearth and the family circle.\r\n\r\nIn the American States power has been disseminated with admirable skill\r\nfor the purpose of interesting the greatest possible number of persons\r\nin the common weal. Independently of the electors who are from time to\r\ntime called into action, the body politic is divided into innumerable\r\nfunctionaries and officers, who all, in their several spheres,\r\nrepresent the same powerful whole in whose name they act. The local\r\nadministration thus affords an unfailing source of profit and interest\r\nto a vast number of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe American system, which divides the local authority among so many\r\ncitizens, does not scruple to multiply the functions of the town\r\nofficers. For in the United States it is believed, and with truth, that\r\npatriotism is a kind of devotion which is strengthened by ritual\r\nobservance. In this manner the activity of the township is continually\r\nperceptible; it is daily manifested in the fulfilment of a duty or the\r\nexercise of a right, and a constant though gentle motion is thus kept\r\nup in society which animates without disturbing it.\r\n\r\nThe American attaches himself to his home as the mountaineer clings to\r\nhis hills, because the characteristic features of his country are there\r\nmore distinctly marked than elsewhere. The existence of the townships\r\nof New England is in general a happy one. Their government is suited to\r\ntheir tastes, and chosen by themselves. In the midst of the profound\r\npeace and general comfort which reign in America the commotions of\r\nmunicipal discord are unfrequent. The conduct of local business is\r\neasy. The political education of the people has long been complete; say\r\nrather that it was complete when the people first set foot upon the\r\nsoil. In New England no tradition exists of a distinction of ranks; no\r\nportion of the community is tempted to oppress the remainder; and the\r\nabuses which may injure isolated individuals are forgotten in the\r\ngeneral contentment which prevails. If the government is defective (and\r\nit would no doubt be easy to point out its deficiencies), the fact that\r\nit really emanates from those it governs, and that it acts, either ill\r\nor well, casts the protecting spell of a parental pride over its\r\nfaults. No term of comparison disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen:\r\nEngland formerly governed the mass of the colonies, but the people was\r\nalways sovereign in the township where its rule is not only an ancient\r\nbut a primitive state.\r\n\r\nThe native of New England is attached to his township because it is\r\nindependent and free: his co-operation in its affairs ensures his\r\nattachment to its interest; the well-being it affords him secures his\r\naffection; and its welfare is the aim of his ambition and of his future\r\nexertions: he takes a part in every occurrence in the place; he\r\npractises the art of government in the small sphere within his reach;\r\nhe accustoms himself to those forms which can alone ensure the steady\r\nprogress of liberty; he imbibes their spirit; he acquires a taste for\r\norder, comprehends the union or the balance of powers, and collects\r\nclear practical notions on the nature of his duties and the extent of\r\nhis rights.\r\n\r\nThe Counties Of New England\r\n\r\nThe division of the countries in America has considerable analogy with\r\nthat of the arrondissements of France. The limits of the counties are\r\narbitrarily laid down, and the various districts which they contain\r\nhave no necessary connection, no common tradition or natural sympathy;\r\ntheir object is simply to facilitate the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the township was too small to contain a system of\r\njudicial institutions; each county has, however, a court of justice, *f\r\na sheriff to execute its decrees, and a prison for criminals. There are\r\ncertain wants which are felt alike by all the townships of a county; it\r\nis therefore natural that they should be satisfied by a central\r\nauthority. In the State of Massachusetts this authority is vested in\r\nthe hands of several magistrates, who are appointed by the Governor of\r\nthe State, with the advice *g of his council. *h The officers of the\r\ncounty have only a limited and occasional authority, which is\r\napplicable to certain predetermined cases. The State and the townships\r\npossess all the power requisite to conduct public business. The budget\r\nof the county is drawn up by its officers, and is voted by the\r\nlegislature, but there is no assembly which directly or indirectly\r\nrepresents the county. It has, therefore, properly speaking, no\r\npolitical existence.\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ See the Act of February 14, 1821, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p.\r\n551.]\r\n\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ See the Act of February 20, 1819, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p.\r\n494.]\r\n\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ The council of the Governor is an elective body.] A twofold tendency\r\nmay be discerned in the American constitutions, which impels the\r\nlegislator to centralize the legislative and to disperse the executive\r\npower. The township of New England has in itself an indestructible\r\nelement of independence; and this distinct existence could only be\r\nfictitiously introduced into the county, where its utility has not been\r\nfelt. But all the townships united have but one representation, which\r\nis the State, the centre of the national authority: beyond the action\r\nof the township and that of the nation, nothing can be said to exist\r\nbut the influence of individual exertion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdministration In New England\r\n\r\nAdministration not perceived in America\xe2\x80\x94Why?\xe2\x80\x94The Europeans believe that\r\nliberty is promoted by depriving the social authority of some of its\r\nrights; the Americans, by dividing its exercise\xe2\x80\x94Almost all the\r\nadministration confined to the township, and divided amongst the\r\ntown-officers\xe2\x80\x94No trace of an administrative body to be perceived,\r\neither in the township or above it\xe2\x80\x94The reason of this\xe2\x80\x94How it happens\r\nthat the administration of the State is uniform\xe2\x80\x94Who is empowered to\r\nenforce the obedience of the township and the county to the law\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nintroduction of judicial power into the administration\xe2\x80\x94Consequence of\r\nthe extension of the elective principle to all functionaries\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nJustice of the Peace in New England\xe2\x80\x94By whom appointed\xe2\x80\x94County officer:\r\nensures the administration of the townships\xe2\x80\x94Court of Sessions\xe2\x80\x94Its\r\naction\xe2\x80\x94Right of inspection and indictment disseminated like the other\r\nadministrative functions\xe2\x80\x94Informers encouraged by the division of fines.\r\n\r\nNothing is more striking to an European traveller in the United States\r\nthan the absence of what we term the Government, or the Administration.\r\nWritten laws exist in America, and one sees that they are daily\r\nexecuted; but although everything is in motion, the hand which gives\r\nthe impulse to the social machine can nowhere be discovered.\r\nNevertheless, as all peoples are obliged to have recourse to certain\r\ngrammatical forms, which are the foundation of human language, in order\r\nto express their thoughts; so all communities are obliged to secure\r\ntheir existence by submitting to a certain dose of authority, without\r\nwhich they fall a prey to anarchy. This authority may be distributed in\r\nseveral ways, but it must always exist somewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of diminishing the force of authority in a\r\nnation: The first is to weaken the supreme power in its very principle,\r\nby forbidding or preventing society from acting in its own defence\r\nunder certain circumstances. To weaken authority in this manner is what\r\nis generally termed in Europe to lay the foundations of freedom. The\r\nsecond manner of diminishing the influence of authority does not\r\nconsist in stripping society of any of its rights, nor in paralyzing\r\nits efforts, but in distributing the exercise of its privileges in\r\nvarious hands, and in multiplying functionaries, to each of whom the\r\ndegree of power necessary for him to perform his duty is entrusted.\r\nThere may be nations whom this distribution of social powers might lead\r\nto anarchy; but in itself it is not anarchical. The action of authority\r\nis indeed thus rendered less irresistible and less perilous, but it is\r\nnot totally suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of the United States was the result of a mature and\r\ndignified taste for freedom, and not of a vague or ill-defined craving\r\nfor independence. It contracted no alliance with the turbulent passions\r\nof anarchy; but its course was marked, on the contrary, by an\r\nattachment to whatever was lawful and orderly.\r\n\r\nIt was never assumed in the United States that the citizen of a free\r\ncountry has a right to do whatever he pleases; on the contrary, social\r\nobligations were there imposed upon him more various than anywhere\r\nelse. No idea was ever entertained of attacking the principles or of\r\ncontesting the rights of society; but the exercise of its authority was\r\ndivided, to the end that the office might be powerful and the officer\r\ninsignificant, and that the community should be at once regulated and\r\nfree. In no country in the world does the law hold so absolute a\r\nlanguage as in America, and in no country is the right of applying it\r\nvested in so many hands. The administrative power in the United States\r\npresents nothing either central or hierarchical in its constitution,\r\nwhich accounts for its passing, unperceived. The power exists, but its\r\nrepresentative is not to be perceived.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the independent townships of New England\r\nprotect their own private interests; and the municipal magistrates are\r\nthe persons to whom the execution of the laws of the State is most\r\nfrequently entrusted. *i Besides the general laws, the State sometimes\r\npasses general police regulations; but more commonly the townships and\r\ntown officers, conjointly with justices of the peace, regulate the\r\nminor details of social life, according to the necessities of the\r\ndifferent localities, and promulgate such enactments as concern the\r\nhealth of the community, and the peace as well as morality of the\r\ncitizens. *j Lastly, these municipal magistrates provide, of their own\r\naccord and without any delegated powers, for those unforeseen\r\nemergencies which frequently occur in society. *k\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cThe Town-Officer,\xe2\x80\x9d especially at the words Selectmen, Assessors,\r\nCollectors, Schools, Surveyors of Highways. I take one example in a\r\nthousand: the State prohibits travelling on the Sunday; the\r\ntything-men, who are town-officers, are specially charged to keep watch\r\nand to execute the law. See the Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 410.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selectmen draw up the lists of electors for the election of the\r\nGovernor, and transmit the result of the ballot to the Secretary of the\r\nState. See Act of February 24, 1796: Id., vol. i. p. 488.]\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ Thus, for instance, the selectmen authorize the construction of\r\ndrains, point out the proper sites for slaughter-houses and other\r\ntrades which are a nuisance to the neighborhood.

See Act\r\nof June 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt results from what we have said that in the State of Massachusetts\r\nthe administrative authority is almost entirely restricted to the\r\ntownship, *l but that it is distributed among a great number of\r\nindividuals. In the French commune there is properly but one official\r\nfunctionary, namely, the Maire; and in New England we have seen that\r\nthere are nineteen. These nineteen functionaries do not in general\r\ndepend upon one another. The law carefully prescribes a circle of\r\naction to each of these magistrates; and within that circle they have\r\nan entire right to perform their functions independently of any other\r\nauthority. Above the township scarcely any trace of a series of\r\nofficial dignitaries is to be found. It sometimes happens that the\r\ncounty officers alter a decision of the townships or town magistrates,\r\n*m but in general the authorities of the county have no right to\r\ninterfere with the authorities of the township, *n except in such\r\nmatters as concern the county.\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ I say almost, for there are various circumstances in the annals of a\r\ntownship which are regulated by the justice of the peace in his\r\nindividual capacity, or by the justices of the peace assembled in the\r\nchief town of the county; thus licenses are granted by the justices.\r\nSee the Act of February 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 297.]\r\n\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ Thus licenses are only granted to such persons as can produce a\r\ncertificate of good conduct from the selectmen.

There is no point which serves as a centre to\r\nthe radii of the administration.\r\n\r\no\r\n[ The town committees of schools are obliged to make an annual report\r\nto the Secretary of the State on the condition of the school. See Act\r\nof March 10, 1827, vol. iii. p. 183.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter V: Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the uniform plan on which the government is conducted,\r\nand how is the compliance of the counties and their magistrates or the\r\ntownships and their officers enforced? In the States of New England the\r\nlegislative authority embraces more subjects than it does in France;\r\nthe legislator penetrates to the very core of the administration; the\r\nlaw descends to the most minute details; the same enactment prescribes\r\nthe principle and the method of its application, and thus imposes a\r\nmultitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations on the secondary\r\nfunctionaries of the State. The consequence of this is that if all the\r\nsecondary functionaries of the administration conform to the law,\r\nsociety in all its branches proceeds with the greatest uniformity: the\r\ndifficulty remains of compelling the secondary functionaries of the\r\nadministration to conform to the law. It may be affirmed that, in\r\ngeneral, society has only two methods of enforcing the execution of the\r\nlaws at its disposal: a discretionary power may be entrusted to a\r\nsuperior functionary of directing all the others, and of cashiering\r\nthem in case of disobedience; or the courts of justice may be\r\nauthorized to inflict judicial penalties on the offender: but these two\r\nmethods are not always available.\r\n\r\nThe right of directing a civil officer presupposes that of cashiering\r\nhim if he does not obey orders, and of rewarding him by promotion if he\r\nfulfils his duties with propriety. But an elected magistrate can\r\nneither be cashiered nor promoted. All elective functions are\r\ninalienable until their term is expired. In fact, the elected\r\nmagistrate has nothing either to expect or to fear from his\r\nconstituents; and when all public offices are filled by ballot there\r\ncan be no series of official dignities, because the double right of\r\ncommanding and of enforcing obedience can never be vested in the same\r\nindividual, and because the power of issuing an order can never be\r\njoined to that of inflicting a punishment or bestowing a reward.\r\n\r\nThe communities therefore in which the secondary functionaries of the\r\ngovernment are elected are perforce obliged to make great use of\r\njudicial penalties as a means of administration. This is not evident at\r\nfirst sight; for those in power are apt to look upon the institution of\r\nelective functionaries as one concession, and the subjection of the\r\nelected magistrate to the judges of the land as another. They are\r\nequally averse to both these innovations; and as they are more\r\npressingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they accede\r\nto the election of the magistrate, and leave him independent of the\r\njudicial power. Nevertheless, the second of these measures is the only\r\nthing that can possibly counterbalance the first; and it will be found\r\nthat an elective authority which is not subject to judicial power will,\r\nsooner or later, either elude all control or be destroyed. The courts\r\nof justice are the only possible medium between the central power and\r\nthe administrative bodies; they alone can compel the elected\r\nfunctionary to obey, without violating the rights of the elector. The\r\nextension of judicial power in the political world ought therefore to\r\nbe in the exact ratio of the extension of elective offices: if these\r\ntwo institutions do not go hand in hand, the State must fall into\r\nanarchy or into subjection.\r\n\r\nIt has always been remarked that habits of legal business do not render\r\nmen apt to the exercise of administrative authority. The Americans have\r\nborrowed from the English, their fathers, the idea of an institution\r\nwhich is unknown upon the continent of Europe: I allude to that of the\r\nJustices of the Peace. The Justice of the Peace is a sort of mezzo\r\ntermine between the magistrate and the man of the world, between the\r\ncivil officer and the judge. A justice of the peace is a well-informed\r\ncitizen, though he is not necessarily versed in the knowledge of the\r\nlaws. His office simply obliges him to execute the police regulations\r\nof society; a task in which good sense and integrity are of more avail\r\nthan legal science. The justice introduces into the administration a\r\ncertain taste for established forms and publicity, which renders him a\r\nmost unserviceable instrument of despotism; and, on the other hand, he\r\nis not blinded by those superstitions which render legal officers unfit\r\nmembers of a government. The Americans have adopted the system of the\r\nEnglish justices of the peace, but they have deprived it of that\r\naristocratic character which is discernible in the mother-country. The\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts *p appoints a certain number of justices of\r\nthe peace in every county, whose functions last seven years. *q He\r\nfurther designates three individuals from amongst the whole body of\r\njustices who form in each county what is called the Court of Sessions.\r\nThe justices take a personal share in public business; they are\r\nsometimes entrusted with administrative functions in conjunction with\r\nelected officers, *r they sometimes constitute a tribunal, before which\r\nthe magistrates summarily prosecute a refractory citizen, or the\r\ncitizens inform against the abuses of the magistrate. But it is in the\r\nCourt of Sessions that they exercise their most important functions.\r\nThis court meets twice a year in the county town; in Massachusetts it\r\nis empowered to enforce the obedience of the greater number *s of\r\npublic officers. *t It must be observed, that in the State of\r\nMassachusetts the Court of Sessions is at the same time an\r\nadministrative body, properly so called, and a political tribunal. It\r\nhas been asserted that the county is a purely administrative division.\r\nThe Court of Sessions presides over that small number of affairs which,\r\nas they concern several townships, or all the townships of the county\r\nin common, cannot be entrusted to any one of them in particular. *u In\r\nall that concerns county business the duties of the Court of Sessions\r\nare purely administrative; and if in its investigations it occasionally\r\nborrows the forms of judicial procedure, it is only with a view to its\r\nown information, *v or as a guarantee to the community over which it\r\npresides. But when the administration of the township is brought before\r\nit, it always acts as a judicial body, and in some few cases as an\r\nofficial assembly.\r\n\r\np\r\n[ We shall hereafter learn what a Governor is: I shall content myself\r\nwith remarking in this place that he represents the executive power of\r\nthe whole State.]\r\n\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ See the Constitution of Massachusetts, chap. II. sect. 1. Section 9;\r\nchap. III. Section 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ Thus, for example, a stranger arrives in a township from a country\r\nwhere a contagious disease prevails, and he falls ill. Two justices of\r\nthe peace can, with the assent of the selectmen, order the sheriff of\r\nthe county to remove and take care of him.\xe2\x80\x94Act of June 22, 1797, vol.\r\ni. p. 540.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general the justices interfere in all the important acts of the\r\nadministration, and give them a semi-judicial character.] [Footnote s:\r\nI say the greater number, because certain administrative misdemeanors\r\nare brought before ordinary tribunals. If, for instance, a township\r\nrefuses to make the necessary expenditure for its schools or to name a\r\nschool-committee, it is liable to a heavy fine. But this penalty is\r\npronounced by the Supreme Judicial Court or the Court of Common Pleas.\r\nSee Act of March 10, 1827, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. iii. p. 190. Or\r\nwhen a township neglects to provide the necessary war-stores.\xe2\x80\x94Act of\r\nFebruary 21, 1822: Id., vol. ii. p. 570.]\r\n\r\nt\r\n[ In their individual capacity the justices of the peace take a part in\r\nthe business of the counties and townships.] [Footnote u: These affairs\r\nmay be brought under the following heads:\xe2\x80\x941. The erection of prisons\r\nand courts of justice. 2. The county budget, which is afterwards voted\r\nby the State. 3. The distribution of the taxes so voted. 4. Grants of\r\ncertain patents. 5. The laying down and repairs of the country roads.]\r\n\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ Thus, when a road is under consideration, almost all difficulties are\r\ndisposed of by the aid of the jury.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty is to procure the obedience of an authority as\r\nentirely independent of the general laws of the State as the township\r\nis. We have stated that assessors are annually named by the\r\ntown-meetings to levy the taxes. If a township attempts to evade the\r\npayment of the taxes by neglecting to name its assessors, the Court of\r\nSessions condemns it to a heavy penalty. *w The fine is levied on each\r\nof the inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is the officer\r\nof justice, executes the mandate. Thus it is that in the United States\r\nthe authority of the Government is mysteriously concealed under the\r\nforms of a judicial sentence; and its influence is at the same time\r\nfortified by that irresistible power with which men have invested the\r\nformalities of law.\r\n\r\nw\r\n[ See Act of February 20, 1786, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 217.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese proceedings are easy to follow and to understand. The demands\r\nmade upon a township are in general plain and accurately defined; they\r\nconsist in a simple fact without any complication, or in a principle\r\nwithout its application in detail. *x But the difficulty increases when\r\nit is not the obedience of the township, but that of the town officers\r\nwhich is to be enforced. All the reprehensible actions of which a\r\npublic functionary may be guilty are reducible to the following heads:\r\n\r\nx\r\n[ There is an indirect method of enforcing the obedience of a township.\r\nSuppose that the funds which the law demands for the maintenance of the\r\nroads have not been voted, the town surveyor is then authorized, ex\r\nofficio, to levy the supplies. As he is personally responsible to\r\nprivate individuals for the state of the roads, and indictable before\r\nthe Court of Sessions, he is sure to employ the extraordinary right\r\nwhich the law gives him against the township. Thus by threatening the\r\nofficer the Court of Sessions exacts compliance from the town. See Act\r\nof March 5, 1787, Id., vol. i. p. 305.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe may execute the law without energy or zeal;\r\n\r\nHe may neglect to execute the law;\r\n\r\nHe may do what the law enjoins him not to do.\r\n\r\nThe last two violations of duty can alone come under the cognizance of\r\na tribunal; a positive and appreciable fact is the indispensable\r\nfoundation of an action at law. Thus, if the selectmen omit to fulfil\r\nthe legal formalities usual at town elections, they may be condemned to\r\npay a fine; *y but when the public officer performs his duty without\r\nability, and when he obeys the letter of the law without zeal or\r\nenergy, he is at least beyond the reach of judicial interference. The\r\nCourt of Sessions, even when it is invested with its official powers,\r\nis in this case unable to compel him to a more satisfactory obedience.\r\nThe fear of removal is the only check to these quasi-offences; and as\r\nthe Court of Sessions does not originate the town authorities, it\r\ncannot remove functionaries whom it does not appoint. Moreover, a\r\nperpetual investigation would be necessary to convict the officer of\r\nnegligence or lukewarmness; and the Court of Sessions sits but twice a\r\nyear and then only judges such offences as are brought before its\r\nnotice. The only security of that active and enlightened obedience\r\nwhich a court of justice cannot impose upon public officers lies in the\r\npossibility of their arbitrary removal. In France this security is\r\nsought for in powers exercised by the heads of the administration; in\r\nAmerica it is sought for in the principle of election.\r\n\r\ny\r\n[ Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 45.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, to recapitulate in a few words what I have been showing: If a\r\npublic officer in New England commits a crime in the exercise of his\r\nfunctions, the ordinary courts of justice are always called upon to\r\npass sentence upon him. If he commits a fault in his official capacity,\r\na purely administrative tribunal is empowered to punish him; and, if\r\nthe affair is important or urgent, the judge supplies the omission of\r\nthe functionary. *z Lastly, if the same individual is guilty of one of\r\nthose intangible offences of which human justice has no cognizance, he\r\nannually appears before a tribunal from which there is no appeal, which\r\ncan at once reduce him to insignificance and deprive him of his charge.\r\nThis system undoubtedly possesses great advantages, but its execution\r\nis attended with a practical difficulty which it is important to point\r\nout.\r\n\r\nz\r\n[ If, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name its\r\nassessors, the Court of Sessions nominates them; and the magistrates\r\nthus appointed are invested with the same authority as elected\r\nofficers. See the Act quoted above, February 20, 1787.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already observed that the administrative tribunal, which is\r\ncalled the Court of Sessions, has no right of inspection over the town\r\nofficers. It can only interfere when the conduct of a magistrate is\r\nspecially brought under its notice; and this is the delicate part of\r\nthe system. The Americans of New England are unacquainted with the\r\noffice of public prosecutor in the Court of Sessions, *a and it may\r\nreadily be perceived that it could not have been established without\r\ndifficulty. If an accusing magistrate had merely been appointed in the\r\nchief town of each county, and if he had been unassisted by agents in\r\nthe townships, he would not have been better acquainted with what was\r\ngoing on in the county than the members of the Court of Sessions. But\r\nto appoint agents in each township would have been to centre in his\r\nperson the most formidable of powers, that of a judicial\r\nadministration. Moreover, laws are the children of habit, and nothing\r\nof the kind exists in the legislation of England. The Americans have\r\ntherefore divided the offices of inspection and of prosecution, as well\r\nas all the other functions of the administration. Grand jurors are\r\nbound by the law to apprise the court to which they belong of all the\r\nmisdemeanors which may have been committed in their county. *b There\r\nare certain great offences which are officially prosecuted by the\r\nStates; *c but more frequently the task of punishing delinquents\r\ndevolves upon the fiscal officer, whose province it is to receive the\r\nfine: thus the treasurer of the township is charged with the\r\nprosecution of such administrative offences as fall under his notice.\r\nBut a more special appeal is made by American legislation to the\r\nprivate interest of the citizen; *d and this great principle is\r\nconstantly to be met with in studying the laws of the United States.\r\nAmerican legislators are more apt to give men credit for intelligence\r\nthan for honesty, and they rely not a little on personal cupidity for\r\nthe execution of the laws. When an individual is really and sensibly\r\ninjured by an administrative abuse, it is natural that his personal\r\ninterest should induce him to prosecute. But if a legal formality be\r\nrequired, which, however advantageous to the community, is of small\r\nimportance to individuals, plaintiffs may be less easily found; and\r\nthus, by a tacit agreement, the laws may fall into disuse. Reduced by\r\ntheir system to this extremity, the Americans are obliged to encourage\r\ninformers by bestowing on them a portion of the penalty in certain\r\ncases, *e and to insure the execution of the laws by the dangerous\r\nexpedient of degrading the morals of the people. The only\r\nadministrative authority above the county magistrates is, properly\r\nspeaking, that of the Government.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ I say the Court of Sessions, because in common courts there is a\r\nmagistrate who exercises some of the functions of a public prosecutor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ The grand-jurors are, for instance, bound to inform the court of the\r\nbad state of the roads.\xe2\x80\x94Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 308.]\r\n\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ If, for instance, the treasurer of the county holds back his\r\naccounts.\xe2\x80\x94Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 406.] [Footnote d: Thus, if\r\na private individual breaks down or is wounded in consequence of the\r\nbadness of a road, he can sue the township or the county for damages at\r\nthe sessions.\xe2\x80\x94Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 309.]\r\n\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ In cases of invasion or insurrection, if the town-officers neglect to\r\nfurnish the necessary stores and ammunition for the militia, the\r\ntownship may be condemned to a fine of from $200 to $500. It may\r\nreadily be imagined that in such a case it might happen that no one\r\ncared to prosecute; hence the law adds that all the citizens may indict\r\noffences of this kind, and that half of the fine shall belong to the\r\nplaintiff. See Act of March 6, 1810, vol. ii. p. 236. The same clause\r\nis frequently to be met with in the law of Massachusetts. Not only are\r\nprivate individuals thus incited to prosecute the public officers, but\r\nthe public officers are encouraged in the same manner to bring the\r\ndisobedience of private individuals to justice. If a citizen refuses to\r\nperform the work which has been assigned to him upon a road, the road\r\nsurveyor may prosecute him, and he receives half the penalty for\r\nhimself.

Townships and a local\r\nactivity exist in every State; but in no part of the confederation is a\r\ntownship to be met with precisely similar to those of New England. The\r\nmore we descend towards the South, the less active does the business of\r\nthe township or parish become; the number of magistrates, of functions,\r\nand of rights decreases; the population exercises a less immediate\r\ninfluence on affairs; town meetings are less frequent, and the subjects\r\nof debate less numerous. The power of the elected magistrate is\r\naugmented and that of the elector diminished, whilst the public spirit\r\nof the local communities is less awakened and less influential. *f\r\nThese differences may be perceived to a certain extent in the State of\r\nNew York; they are very sensible in Pennsylvania; but they become less\r\nstriking as we advance to the northwest. The majority of the emigrants\r\nwho settle in the northwestern States are natives of New England, and\r\nthey carry the habits of their mother country with them into that which\r\nthey adopt. A township in Ohio is by no means dissimilar from a\r\ntownship in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ For details see the Revised Statutes of the State of New York, part\r\ni. chap. xi. vol. i. pp. 336-364, entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cOf the Powers, Duties, and\r\nPrivileges of Towns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSee in the Digest of the Laws of Pennsylvania, the words Assessors,\r\nCollector, Constables, Overseer of the Poor, Supervisors of Highways;\r\nand in the Acts of a general nature of the State of Ohio, the Act of\r\nFebruary 25, 1834, relating to townships, p. 412; besides the peculiar\r\ndispositions relating to divers town-officers, such as Township\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nClerk, Trustees, Overseers of the Poor, Fence Viewers, Appraisers of\r\nProperty, Township\xe2\x80\x99s Treasurer, Constables, Supervisors of Highways.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Massachusetts the mainspring of public\r\nadministration lies in the township. It forms the common centre of the\r\ninterests and affections of the citizens. But this ceases to be the\r\ncase as we descend to States in which knowledge is less generally\r\ndiffused, and where the township consequently offers fewer guarantees\r\nof a wise and active administration. As we leave New England,\r\ntherefore, we find that the importance of the town is gradually\r\ntransferred to the county, which becomes the centre of administration,\r\nand the intermediate power between the Government and the citizen. In\r\nMassachusetts the business of the county is conducted by the Court of\r\nSessions, which is composed of a quorum named by the Governor and his\r\ncouncil; but the county has no representative assembly, and its\r\nexpenditure is voted by the national legislature. In the great State of\r\nNew York, on the contrary, and in those of Ohio and Pennsylvania, the\r\ninhabitants of each county choose a certain number of representatives,\r\nwho constitute the assembly of the county. *g The county assembly has\r\nthe right of taxing the inhabitants to a certain extent; and in this\r\nrespect it enjoys the privileges of a real legislative body: at the\r\nsame time it exercises an executive power in the county, frequently\r\ndirects the administration of the townships, and restricts their\r\nauthority within much narrower bounds than in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ See the Revised Statutes of the State of New York, part i. chap. xi.\r\nvol. i. p. 340.

In the State of New York each township\r\nelects a representative, who has a share in the administration of the\r\ncounty as well as in that of the township.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal differences which the systems of county and town\r\nadministration present in the Federal States. Were it my intention to\r\nexamine the provisions of American law minutely, I should have to point\r\nout still further differences in the executive details of the several\r\ncommunities. But what I have already said may suffice to show the\r\ngeneral principles on which the administration of the United States\r\nrests. These principles are differently applied; their consequences are\r\nmore or less numerous in various localities; but they are always\r\nsubstantially the same. The laws differ, and their outward features\r\nchange, but their character does not vary. If the township and the\r\ncounty are not everywhere constituted in the same manner, it is at\r\nleast true that in the United States the county and the township are\r\nalways based upon the same principle, namely, that everyone is the best\r\njudge of what concerns himself alone, and the most proper person to\r\nsupply his private wants. The township and the county are therefore\r\nbound to take care of their special interests: the State governs, but\r\nit does not interfere with their administration. Exceptions to this\r\nrule may be met with, but not a contrary principle.\r\n\r\nThe first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all the\r\nmagistrates to be chosen either by or at least from amongst the\r\ncitizens. As the officers are everywhere elected or appointed for a\r\ncertain period, it has been impossible to establish the rules of a\r\ndependent series of authorities; there are almost as many independent\r\nfunctionaries as there are functions, and the executive power is\r\ndisseminated in a multitude of hands. Hence arose the indispensable\r\nnecessity of introducing the control of the courts of justice over the\r\nadministration, and the system of pecuniary penalties, by which the\r\nsecondary bodies and their representatives are constrained to obey the\r\nlaws. This system obtains from one end of the Union to the other. The\r\npower of punishing the misconduct of public officers, or of performing\r\nthe part of the executive in urgent cases, has not, however, been\r\nbestowed on the same judges in all the States. The Anglo-Americans\r\nderived the institution of justices of the peace from a common source;\r\nbut although it exists in all the States, it is not always turned to\r\nthe same use. The justices of the peace everywhere participate in the\r\nadministration of the townships and the counties, *h either as public\r\nofficers or as the judges of public misdemeanors, but in most of the\r\nStates the more important classes of public offences come under the\r\ncognizance of the ordinary tribunals.\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ In some of the Southern States the county courts are charged with all\r\nthe details of the administration. See the Statutes of the State of\r\nTennessee, arts. Judiciary, Taxes, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of public officers, or the inalienability of their\r\nfunctions, the absence of a gradation of powers, and the introduction\r\nof a judicial control over the secondary branches of the\r\nadministration, are the universal characteristics of the American\r\nsystem from Maine to the Floridas. In some States (and that of New York\r\nhas advanced most in this direction) traces of a centralized\r\nadministration begin to be discernible. In the State of New York the\r\nofficers of the central government exercise, in certain cases, a sort\r\nof inspection or control over the secondary bodies. *i\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ For instance, the direction of public instruction centres in the\r\nhands of the Government. The legislature names the members of the\r\nUniversity, who are denominated Regents; the Governor and\r\nLieutentant-Governor of the State are necessarily of the\r\nnumber.\xe2\x80\x94Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455. The Regents of the University\r\nannually visit the colleges and academies, and make their report to the\r\nlegislature. Their superintendence is not inefficient, for several\r\nreasons: the colleges in order to become corporations stand in need of\r\na charter, which is only granted on the recommendation of the Regents;\r\nevery year funds are distributed by the State for the encouragement of\r\nlearning, and the Regents are the distributors of this money. See chap.\r\nxv. \xe2\x80\x9cInstruction,\xe2\x80\x9d Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school-commissioners are obliged to send an annual report to the\r\nSuperintendent of the Republic.\xe2\x80\x94Id. p. 488.\r\n\r\nA similar report is annually made to the same person on the number and\r\ncondition of the poor.\xe2\x80\x94Id. p. 631.]\r\n\r\nAt other times they constitute a court of appeal for the decision of\r\naffairs. *j In the State of New York judicial penalties are less used\r\nthan in other parts as a means of administration, and the right of\r\nprosecuting the offences of public officers is vested in fewer hands.\r\n*k The same tendency is faintly observable in some other States; *l but\r\nin general the prominent feature of the administration in the United\r\nStates is its excessive local independence.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ If any one conceives himself to be wronged by the\r\nschool-commissioners (who are town-officers), he can appeal to the\r\nsuperintendent of the primary schools, whose decision is final.\xe2\x80\x94Revised\r\nStatutes, vol. i. p. 487.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisions similar to those above cited are to be met with from time to\r\ntime in the laws of the State of New York; but in general these\r\nattempts at centralization are weak and unproductive. The great\r\nauthorities of the State have the right of watching and controlling the\r\nsubordinate agents, without that of rewarding or punishing them. The\r\nsame individual is never empowered to give an order and to punish\r\ndisobedience; he has therefore the right of commanding, without the\r\nmeans of exacting compliance. In 1830 the Superintendent of Schools\r\ncomplained in his Annual Report addressed to the legislature that\r\nseveral school-commissioners had neglected, notwithstanding his\r\napplication, to furnish him with the accounts which were due. He added\r\nthat if this omission continued he should be obliged to prosecute them,\r\nas the law directs, before the proper tribunals.]\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ Thus the district-attorney is directed to recover all fines below the\r\nsum of fifty dollars, unless such a right has been specially awarded to\r\nanother magistrate.\xe2\x80\x94Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 383.]\r\n\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ Several traces of centralization may be discovered in Massachusetts;\r\nfor instance, the committees of the town-schools are directed to make\r\nan annual report to the Secretary of State. See Laws of Massachusetts,\r\nvol. i. p. 367.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf The State\r\n\r\nI have described the townships and the administration; it now remains\r\nfor me to speak of the State and the Government. This is ground I may\r\npass over rapidly, without fear of being misunderstood; for all I have\r\nto say is to be found in written forms of the various constitutions,\r\nwhich are easily to be procured. These constitutions rest upon a simple\r\nand rational theory; their forms have been adopted by all\r\nconstitutional nations, and are become familiar to us. In this place,\r\ntherefore, it is only necessary for me to give a short analysis; I\r\nshall endeavor afterwards to pass judgment upon what I now describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter V: Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States\xe2\x80\x94Part III\r\n\r\nLegislative Power Of The State\r\n\r\nDivision of the Legislative Body into two Houses\xe2\x80\x94Senate\xe2\x80\x94House of\r\nRepresentatives\xe2\x80\x94Different functions of these two Bodies.\r\n\r\nThe legislative power of the State is vested in two assemblies, the\r\nfirst of which generally bears the name of the Senate. The Senate is\r\ncommonly a legislative body; but it sometimes becomes an executive and\r\njudicial one. It takes a part in the government in several ways,\r\naccording to the constitution of the different States; *m but it is in\r\nthe nomination of public functionaries that it most commonly assumes an\r\nexecutive power. It partakes of judicial power in the trial of certain\r\npolitical offences, and sometimes also in the decision of certain civil\r\ncases. *n The number of its members is always small. The other branch\r\nof the legislature, which is usually called the House of\r\nRepresentatives, has no share whatever in the administration, and only\r\ntakes a part in the judicial power inasmuch as it impeaches public\r\nfunctionaries before the Senate. The members of the two Houses are\r\nnearly everywhere subject to the same conditions of election. They are\r\nchosen in the same manner, and by the same citizens. The only\r\ndifference which exists between them is, that the term for which the\r\nSenate is chosen is in general longer than that of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The latter seldom remain in office longer than a year;\r\nthe former usually sit two or three years. By granting to the senators\r\nthe privilege of being chosen for several years, and being renewed\r\nseriatim, the law takes care to preserve in the legislative body a\r\nnucleus of men already accustomed to public business, and capable of\r\nexercising a salutary influence upon the junior members.\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ In Massachusetts the Senate is not invested with any administrative\r\nfunctions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ As in the State of New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Americans, plainly, did not desire, by this separation of the\r\nlegislative body into two branches, to make one house hereditary and\r\nthe other elective; one aristocratic and the other democratic. It was\r\nnot their object to create in the one a bulwark to power, whilst the\r\nother represented the interests and passions of the people. The only\r\nadvantages which result from the present constitution of the United\r\nStates are the division of the legislative power and the consequent\r\ncheck upon political assemblies; with the creation of a tribunal of\r\nappeal for the revision of the laws.\r\n\r\nTime and experience, however, have convinced the Americans that if\r\nthese are its only advantages, the division of the legislative power is\r\nstill a principle of the greatest necessity. Pennsylvania was the only\r\none of the United States which at first attempted to establish a single\r\nHouse of Assembly, and Franklin himself was so far carried away by the\r\nnecessary consequences of the principle of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople as to have concurred in the measure; but the Pennsylvanians were\r\nsoon obliged to change the law, and to create two Houses. Thus the\r\nprinciple of the division of the legislative power was finally\r\nestablished, and its necessity may henceforward be regarded as a\r\ndemonstrated truth. This theory, which was nearly unknown to the\r\nrepublics of antiquity\xe2\x80\x94which was introduced into the world almost by\r\naccident, like so many other great truths\xe2\x80\x94and misunderstood by several\r\nmodern nations, is at length become an axiom in the political science\r\nof the present age.\r\n\r\n[See Benjamin Franklin]\r\n\r\nThe Executive Power Of The State\r\n\r\nOffice of Governor in an American State\xe2\x80\x94The place he occupies in\r\nrelation to the Legislature\xe2\x80\x94His rights and his duties\xe2\x80\x94His dependence on\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe executive power of the State may with truth be said to be\r\nrepresented by the Governor, although he enjoys but a portion of its\r\nrights. The supreme magistrate, under the title of Governor, is the\r\nofficial moderator and counsellor of the legislature. He is armed with\r\na veto or suspensive power, which allows him to stop, or at least to\r\nretard, its movements at pleasure. He lays the wants of the country\r\nbefore the legislative body, and points out the means which he thinks\r\nmay be usefully employed in providing for them; he is the natural\r\nexecutor of its decrees in all the undertakings which interest the\r\nnation at large. *o In the absence of the legislature, the Governor is\r\nbound to take all necessary steps to guard the State against violent\r\nshocks and unforeseen dangers. The whole military power of the State is\r\nat the disposal of the Governor. He is the commander of the militia,\r\nand head of the armed force. When the authority, which is by general\r\nconsent awarded to the laws, is disregarded, the Governor puts himself\r\nat the head of the armed force of the State, to quell resistance, and\r\nto restore order. Lastly, the Governor takes no share in the\r\nadministration of townships and counties, except it be indirectly in\r\nthe nomination of Justices of the Peace, which nomination he has not\r\nthe power to cancel. *p The Governor is an elected magistrate, and is\r\ngenerally chosen for one or two years only; so that he always continues\r\nto be strictly dependent upon the majority who returned him.\r\n\r\no\r\n[ Practically speaking, it is not always the Governor who executes the\r\nplans of the Legislature; it often happens that the latter, in voting a\r\nmeasure, names special agents to superintend the execution of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\np\r\n[ In some of the States the justices of the peace are not elected by\r\nthe Governor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Effects Of The System Of Local Administration In The United\r\nStates\r\n\r\nNecessary distinction between the general centralization of Government\r\nand the centralization of the local administration\xe2\x80\x94Local administration\r\nnot centralized in the United States: great general centralization of\r\nthe Government\xe2\x80\x94Some bad consequences resulting to the United States\r\nfrom the local administration\xe2\x80\x94Administrative advantages attending this\r\norder of things\xe2\x80\x94The power which conducts the Government is less\r\nregular, less enlightened, less learned, but much greater than in\r\nEurope\xe2\x80\x94Political advantages of this order of things\xe2\x80\x94In the United\r\nStates the interests of the country are everywhere kept in view\xe2\x80\x94Support\r\ngiven to the Government by the community\xe2\x80\x94Provincial institutions more\r\nnecessary in proportion as the social condition becomes more\r\ndemocratic\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this.\r\n\r\nCentralization is become a word of general and daily use, without any\r\nprecise meaning being attached to it. Nevertheless, there exist two\r\ndistinct kinds of centralization, which it is necessary to discriminate\r\nwith accuracy. Certain interests are common to all parts of a nation,\r\nsuch as the enactment of its general laws and the maintenance of its\r\nforeign relations. Other interests are peculiar to certain parts of the\r\nnation; such, for instance, as the business of different townships.\r\nWhen the power which directs the general interests is centred in one\r\nplace, or vested in the same persons, it constitutes a central\r\ngovernment. In like manner the power of directing partial or local\r\ninterests, when brought together into one place, constitutes what may\r\nbe termed a central administration.\r\n\r\nUpon some points these two kinds of centralization coalesce; but by\r\nclassifying the objects which fall more particularly within the\r\nprovince of each of them, they may easily be distinguished. It is\r\nevident that a central government acquires immense power when united to\r\nadministrative centralization. Thus combined, it accustoms men to set\r\ntheir own will habitually and completely aside; to submit, not only for\r\nonce, or upon one point, but in every respect, and at all times. Not\r\nonly, therefore, does this union of power subdue them compulsorily, but\r\nit affects them in the ordinary habits of life, and influences each\r\nindividual, first separately and then collectively.\r\n\r\nThese two kinds of centralization mutually assist and attract each\r\nother; but they must not be supposed to be inseparable. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine a more completely central government than that\r\nwhich existed in France under Louis XIV.; when the same individual was\r\nthe author and the interpreter of the laws, and the representative of\r\nFrance at home and abroad, he was justified in asserting that the State\r\nwas identified with his person. Nevertheless, the administration was\r\nmuch less centralized under Louis XIV. than it is at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn England the centralization of the government is carried to great\r\nperfection; the State has the compact vigor of a man, and by the sole\r\nact of its will it puts immense engines in motion, and wields or\r\ncollects the efforts of its authority. Indeed, I cannot conceive that a\r\nnation can enjoy a secure or prosperous existence without a powerful\r\ncentralization of government. But I am of opinion that a central\r\nadministration enervates the nations in which it exists by incessantly\r\ndiminishing their public spirit. If such an administration succeeds in\r\ncondensing at a given moment, on a given point, all the disposable\r\nresources of a people, it impairs at least the renewal of those\r\nresources. It may ensure a victory in the hour of strife, but it\r\ngradually relaxes the sinews of strength. It may contribute admirably\r\nto the transient greatness of a man, but it cannot ensure the durable\r\nprosperity of a nation.\r\n\r\nIf we pay proper attention, we shall find that whenever it is said that\r\na State cannot act because it has no central point, it is the\r\ncentralization of the government in which it is deficient. It is\r\nfrequently asserted, and we are prepared to assent to the proposition,\r\nthat the German empire was never able to bring all its powers into\r\naction. But the reason was, that the State was never able to enforce\r\nobedience to its general laws, because the several members of that\r\ngreat body always claimed the right, or found the means, of refusing\r\ntheir co-operation to the representatives of the common authority, even\r\nin the affairs which concerned the mass of the people; in other words,\r\nbecause there was no centralization of government. The same remark is\r\napplicable to the Middle Ages; the cause of all the confusion of feudal\r\nsociety was that the control, not only of local but of general\r\ninterests, was divided amongst a thousand hands, and broken up in a\r\nthousand different ways; the absence of a central government prevented\r\nthe nations of Europe from advancing with energy in any straightforward\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that in the United States no central administration and\r\nno dependent series of public functionaries exist. Local authority has\r\nbeen carried to lengths which no European nation could endure without\r\ngreat inconvenience, and which has even produced some disadvantageous\r\nconsequences in America. But in the United States the centralization of\r\nthe Government is complete; and it would be easy to prove that the\r\nnational power is more compact than it has ever been in the old nations\r\nof Europe. Not only is there but one legislative body in each State;\r\nnot only does there exist but one source of political authority; but\r\ndistrict assemblies and county courts have not in general been\r\nmultiplied, lest they should be tempted to exceed their administrative\r\nduties, and interfere with the Government. In America the legislature\r\nof each State is supreme; nothing can impede its authority; neither\r\nprivileges, nor local immunities, nor personal influence, nor even the\r\nempire of reason, since it represents that majority which claims to be\r\nthe sole organ of reason. Its own determination is, therefore, the only\r\nlimit to this action. In juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate\r\ncontrol, is the representative of the executive power, whose duty it is\r\nto constrain the refractory to submit by superior force. The only\r\nsymptom of weakness lies in certain details of the action of the\r\nGovernment. The American republics have no standing armies to\r\nintimidate a discontented minority; but as no minority has as yet been\r\nreduced to declare open war, the necessity of an army has not been\r\nfelt. *q The State usually employs the officers of the township or the\r\ncounty to deal with the citizens. Thus, for instance, in New England,\r\nthe assessor fixes the rate of taxes; the collector receives them; the\r\ntown-treasurer transmits the amount to the public treasury; and the\r\ndisputes which may arise are brought before the ordinary courts of\r\njustice. This method of collecting taxes is slow as well as\r\ninconvenient, and it would prove a perpetual hindrance to a Government\r\nwhose pecuniary demands were large. It is desirable that, in whatever\r\nmaterially affects its existence, the Government should be served by\r\nofficers of its own, appointed by itself, removable at pleasure, and\r\naccustomed to rapid methods of proceeding. But it will always be easy\r\nfor the central government, organized as it is in America, to introduce\r\nnew and more efficacious modes of action, proportioned to its wants.\r\n[Footnote q: [The Civil War of 1860-65 cruelly belied this statement,\r\nand in the course of the struggle the North alone called two millions\r\nand a half of men to arms; but to the honor of the United States it\r\nmust be added that, with the cessation of the contest, this army\r\ndisappeared as rapidly as it had been raised.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]]\r\n\r\nThe absence of a central government will not, then, as has often been\r\nasserted, prove the destruction of the republics of the New World; far\r\nfrom supposing that the American governments are not sufficiently\r\ncentralized, I shall prove hereafter that they are too much so. The\r\nlegislative bodies daily encroach upon the authority of the Government,\r\nand their tendency, like that of the French Convention, is to\r\nappropriate it entirely to themselves. Under these circumstances the\r\nsocial power is constantly changing hands, because it is subordinate to\r\nthe power of the people, which is too apt to forget the maxims of\r\nwisdom and of foresight in the consciousness of its strength: hence\r\narises its danger; and thus its vigor, and not its impotence, will\r\nprobably be the cause of its ultimate destruction.\r\n\r\nThe system of local administration produces several different effects\r\nin America. The Americans seem to me to have outstepped the limits of\r\nsound policy in isolating the administration of the Government; for\r\norder, even in second-rate affairs, is a matter of national importance.\r\n*r As the State has no administrative functionaries of its own,\r\nstationed on different points of its territory, to whom it can give a\r\ncommon impulse, the consequence is that it rarely attempts to issue any\r\ngeneral police regulations. The want of these regulations is severely\r\nfelt, and is frequently observed by Europeans. The appearance of\r\ndisorder which prevails on the surface leads him at first to imagine\r\nthat society is in a state of anarchy; nor does he perceive his mistake\r\ntill he has gone deeper into the subject. Certain undertakings are of\r\nimportance to the whole State; but they cannot be put in execution,\r\nbecause there is no national administration to direct them. Abandoned\r\nto the exertions of the towns or counties, under the care of elected or\r\ntemporary agents, they lead to no result, or at least to no durable\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ The authority which represents the State ought not, I think, to waive\r\nthe right of inspecting the local administration, even when it does not\r\ninterfere more actively. Suppose, for instance, that an agent of the\r\nGovernment was stationed at some appointed spot in the country, to\r\nprosecute the misdemeanors of the town and county officers, would not a\r\nmore uniform order be the result, without in any way compromising the\r\nindependence of the township? Nothing of the kind, however, exists in\r\nAmerica: there is nothing above the county-courts, which have, as it\r\nwere, only an incidental cognizance of the offences they are meant to\r\nrepress.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partisans of centralization in Europe are wont to maintain that the\r\nGovernment directs the affairs of each locality better than the\r\ncitizens could do it for themselves; this may be true when the central\r\npower is enlightened, and when the local districts are ignorant; when\r\nit is as alert as they are slow; when it is accustomed to act, and they\r\nto obey. Indeed, it is evident that this double tendency must augment\r\nwith the increase of centralization, and that the readiness of the one\r\nand the incapacity of the others must become more and more prominent.\r\nBut I deny that such is the case when the people is as enlightened, as\r\nawake to its interests, and as accustomed to reflect on them, as the\r\nAmericans are. I am persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the\r\ncollective strength of the citizens will always conduce more\r\nefficaciously to the public welfare than the authority of the\r\nGovernment. It is difficult to point out with certainty the means of\r\narousing a sleeping population, and of giving it passions and knowledge\r\nwhich it does not possess; it is, I am well aware, an arduous task to\r\npersuade men to busy themselves about their own affairs; and it would\r\nfrequently be easier to interest them in the punctilios of court\r\netiquette than in the repairs of their common dwelling. But whenever a\r\ncentral administration affects to supersede the persons most\r\ninterested, I am inclined to suppose that it is either misled or\r\ndesirous to mislead. However enlightened and however skilful a central\r\npower may be, it cannot of itself embrace all the details of the\r\nexistence of a great nation. Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man.\r\nAnd when it attempts to create and set in motion so many complicated\r\nsprings, it must submit to a very imperfect result, or consume itself\r\nin bootless efforts.\r\n\r\nCentralization succeeds more easily, indeed, in subjecting the external\r\nactions of men to a certain uniformity, which at least commands our\r\nregard, independently of the objects to which it is applied, like those\r\ndevotees who worship the statue and forget the deity it represents.\r\nCentralization imparts without difficulty an admirable regularity to\r\nthe routine of business; provides for the details of the social police\r\nwith sagacity; represses the smallest disorder and the most petty\r\nmisdemeanors; maintains society in a status quo alike secure from\r\nimprovement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy precision in the\r\nconduct of affairs, which is hailed by the heads of the administration\r\nas a sign of perfect order and public tranquillity: *s in short, it\r\nexcels more in prevention than in action. Its force deserts it when\r\nsociety is to be disturbed or accelerated in its course; and if once\r\nthe co-operation of private citizens is necessary to the furtherance of\r\nits measures, the secret of its impotence is disclosed. Even whilst it\r\ninvokes their assistance, it is on the condition that they shall act\r\nexactly as much as the Government chooses, and exactly in the manner it\r\nappoints. They are to take charge of the details, without aspiring to\r\nguide the system; they are to work in a dark and subordinate sphere,\r\nand only to judge the acts in which they have themselves cooperated by\r\ntheir results. These, however, are not conditions on which the alliance\r\nof the human will is to be obtained; its carriage must be free and its\r\nactions responsible, or (such is the constitution of man) the citizen\r\nhad rather remain a passive spectator than a dependent actor in schemes\r\nwith which he is unacquainted.\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ China appears to me to present the most perfect instance of that\r\nspecies of well-being which a completely central administration may\r\nfurnish to the nations among which it exists. Travellers assure us that\r\nthe Chinese have peace without happiness, industry without improvement,\r\nstability without strength, and public order without public morality.\r\nThe condition of society is always tolerable, never excellent. I am\r\nconvinced that, when China is opened to European observation, it will\r\nbe found to contain the most perfect model of a central administration\r\nwhich exists in the universe.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that the want of those uniform regulations which\r\ncontrol the conduct of every inhabitant of France is not unfrequently\r\nfelt in the United States. Gross instances of social indifference and\r\nneglect are to be met with, and from time to time disgraceful blemishes\r\nare seen in complete contrast with the surrounding civilization. Useful\r\nundertakings which cannot succeed without perpetual attention and\r\nrigorous exactitude are very frequently abandoned in the end; for in\r\nAmerica, as well as in other countries, the people is subject to sudden\r\nimpulses and momentary exertions. The European who is accustomed to\r\nfind a functionary always at hand to interfere with all he undertakes\r\nhas some difficulty in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of\r\nthe administration of the townships. In general it may be affirmed that\r\nthe lesser details of the police, which render life easy and\r\ncomfortable, are neglected in America; but that the essential\r\nguarantees of man in society are as strong there as elsewhere. In\r\nAmerica the power which conducts the Government is far less regular,\r\nless enlightened, and less learned, but an hundredfold more\r\nauthoritative than in Europe. In no country in the world do the\r\ncitizens make such exertions for the common weal; and I am acquainted\r\nwith no people which has established schools as numerous and as\r\nefficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants of the\r\ninhabitants, or roads kept in better repair. Uniformity or permanence\r\nof design, the minute arrangement of details, *t and the perfection of\r\nan ingenious administration, must not be sought for in the United\r\nStates; but it will be easy to find, on the other hand, the symptoms of\r\na power which, if it is somewhat barbarous, is at least robust; and of\r\nan existence which is checkered with accidents indeed, but cheered at\r\nthe same time by animation and effort.\r\n\r\nt\r\n[ A writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has drawn between\r\nthe finances of France and those of the United States, has proved that\r\ningenuity cannot always supply the place of a knowledge of facts, very\r\njustly reproaches the Americans for the sort of confusion which exists\r\nin the accounts of the expenditure in the townships; and after giving\r\nthe model of a departmental budget in France, he adds:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWe are indebted\r\nto centralization, that admirable invention of a great man, for the\r\nuniform order and method which prevail alike in all the municipal\r\nbudgets, from the largest town to the humblest commune.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever may\r\nbe my admiration of this result, when I see the communes of France,\r\nwith their excellent system of accounts, plunged into the grossest\r\nignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to so incorrigible an\r\napathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to live; when, on the\r\nother hand, I observe the activity, the information, and the spirit of\r\nenterprise which keep society in perpetual labor, in those American\r\ntownships whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with still\r\nless uniformity, I am struck by the spectacle; for to my mind the end\r\nof a good government is to ensure the welfare of a people, and not to\r\nestablish order and regularity in the midst of its misery and its\r\ndistress. I am therefore led to suppose that the prosperity of the\r\nAmerican townships and the apparent confusion of their accounts, the\r\ndistress of the French communes and the perfection of their budget, may\r\nbe attributable to the same cause. At any rate I am suspicious of a\r\nbenefit which is united to so many evils, and I am not averse to an\r\nevil which is compensated by so many benefits.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGranting for an instant that the villages and counties of the United\r\nStates would be more usefully governed by a remote authority which they\r\nhad never seen than by functionaries taken from the midst of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94admitting, for the sake of argument, that the country would be\r\nmore secure, and the resources of society better employed, if the whole\r\nadministration centred in a single arm\xe2\x80\x94still the political advantages\r\nwhich the Americans derive from their system would induce me to prefer\r\nit to the contrary plan. It profits me but little, after all, that a\r\nvigilant authority should protect the tranquillity of my pleasures and\r\nconstantly avert all dangers from my path, without my care or my\r\nconcern, if this same authority is the absolute mistress of my liberty\r\nand of my life, and if it so monopolizes all the energy of existence\r\nthat when it languishes everything languishes around it, that when it\r\nsleeps everything must sleep, that when it dies the State itself must\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nIn certain countries of Europe the natives consider themselves as a\r\nkind of settlers, indifferent to the fate of the spot upon which they\r\nlive. The greatest changes are effected without their concurrence and\r\n(unless chance may have apprised them of the event) without their\r\nknowledge; nay more, the citizen is unconcerned as to the condition of\r\nhis village, the police of his street, the repairs of the church or of\r\nthe parsonage; for he looks upon all these things as unconnected with\r\nhimself, and as the property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the\r\nGovernment. He has only a life-interest in these possessions, and he\r\nentertains no notions of ownership or of improvement. This want of\r\ninterest in his own affairs goes so far that, if his own safety or that\r\nof his children is endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he\r\nwill fold his arms, and wait till the nation comes to his assistance.\r\nThis same individual, who has so completely sacrificed his own free\r\nwill, has no natural propensity to obedience; he cowers, it is true,\r\nbefore the pettiest officer; but he braves the law with the spirit of a\r\nconquered foe as soon as its superior force is removed: his\r\noscillations between servitude and license are perpetual. When a nation\r\nhas arrived at this state it must either change its customs and its\r\nlaws or perish: the source of public virtue is dry, and, though it may\r\ncontain subjects, the race of citizens is extinct. Such communities are\r\na natural prey to foreign conquests, and if they do not disappear from\r\nthe scene of life, it is because they are surrounded by other nations\r\nsimilar or inferior to themselves: it is because the instinctive\r\nfeeling of their country\xe2\x80\x99s claims still exists in their hearts; and\r\nbecause an involuntary pride in the name it bears, or a vague\r\nreminiscence of its bygone fame, suffices to give them the impulse of\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nNor can the prodigious exertions made by tribes in the defence of a\r\ncountry to which they did not belong be adduced in favor of such a\r\nsystem; for it will be found that in these cases their main incitement\r\nwas religion. The permanence, the glory, or the prosperity of the\r\nnation were become parts of their faith, and in defending the country\r\nthey inhabited they defended that Holy City of which they were all\r\ncitizens. The Turkish tribes have never taken an active share in the\r\nconduct of the affairs of society, but they accomplished stupendous\r\nenterprises as long as the victories of the Sultan were the triumphs of\r\nthe Mohammedan faith. In the present age they are in rapid decay,\r\nbecause their religion is departing, and despotism only remains.\r\nMontesquieu, who attributed to absolute power an authority peculiar to\r\nitself, did it, as I conceive, an undeserved honor; for despotism,\r\ntaken by itself, can produce no durable results. On close inspection we\r\nshall find that religion, and not fear, has ever been the cause of the\r\nlong-lived prosperity of an absolute government. Whatever exertions may\r\nbe made, no true power can be founded among men which does not depend\r\nupon the free union of their inclinations; and patriotism and religion\r\nare the only two motives in the world which can permanently direct the\r\nwhole of a body politic to one end.\r\n\r\nLaws cannot succeed in rekindling the ardor of an extinguished faith,\r\nbut men may be interested in the fate of their country by the laws. By\r\nthis influence the vague impulse of patriotism, which never abandons\r\nthe human heart, may be directed and revived; and if it be connected\r\nwith the thoughts, the passions, and the daily habits of life, it may\r\nbe consolidated into a durable and rational sentiment.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said that the time for the experiment is already past;\r\nfor the old age of nations is not like the old age of men, and every\r\nfresh generation is a new people ready for the care of the legislator.\r\n\r\nIt is not the administrative but the political effects of the local\r\nsystem that I most admire in America. In the United States the\r\ninterests of the country are everywhere kept in view; they are an\r\nobject of solicitude to the people of the whole Union, and every\r\ncitizen is as warmly attached to them as if they were his own. He takes\r\npride in the glory of his nation; he boasts of its success, to which he\r\nconceives himself to have contributed, and he rejoices in the general\r\nprosperity by which he profits. The feeling he entertains towards the\r\nState is analogous to that which unites him to his family, and it is by\r\na kind of egotism that he interests himself in the welfare of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe European generally submits to a public officer because he\r\nrepresents a superior force; but to an American he represents a right.\r\nIn America it may be said that no one renders obedience to man, but to\r\njustice and to law. If the opinion which the citizen entertains of\r\nhimself is exaggerated, it is at least salutary; he unhesitatingly\r\nconfides in his own powers, which appear to him to be all-sufficient.\r\nWhen a private individual meditates an undertaking, however directly\r\nconnected it may be with the welfare of society, he never thinks of\r\nsoliciting the co-operation of the Government, but he publishes his\r\nplan, offers to execute it himself, courts the assistance of other\r\nindividuals, and struggles manfully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly\r\nhe is often less successful than the State might have been in his\r\nposition; but in the end the sum of these private undertakings far\r\nexceeds all that the Government could have done.\r\n\r\nAs the administrative authority is within the reach of the citizens,\r\nwhom it in some degree represents, it excites neither their jealousy\r\nnor their hatred; as its resources are limited, every one feels that he\r\nmust not rely solely on its assistance. Thus, when the administration\r\nthinks fit to interfere, it is not abandoned to itself as in Europe;\r\nthe duties of the private citizens are not supposed to have lapsed\r\nbecause the State assists in their fulfilment, but every one is ready,\r\non the contrary, to guide and to support it. This action of individual\r\nexertions, joined to that of the public authorities, frequently\r\nperforms what the most energetic central administration would be unable\r\nto execute. It would be easy to adduce several facts in proof of what I\r\nadvance, but I had rather give only one, with which I am more\r\nthoroughly acquainted. *u In America the means which the authorities\r\nhave at their disposal for the discovery of crimes and the arrest of\r\ncriminals are few. The State police does not exist, and passports are\r\nunknown. The criminal police of the United States cannot be compared to\r\nthat of France; the magistrates and public prosecutors are not\r\nnumerous, and the examinations of prisoners are rapid and oral.\r\nNevertheless in no country does crime more rarely elude punishment. The\r\nreason is, that every one conceives himself to be interested in\r\nfurnishing evidence of the act committed, and in stopping the\r\ndelinquent. During my stay in the United States I witnessed the\r\nspontaneous formation of committees for the pursuit and prosecution of\r\na man who had committed a great crime in a certain county. In Europe a\r\ncriminal is an unhappy being who is struggling for his life against the\r\nministers of justice, whilst the population is merely a spectator of\r\nthe conflict; in America he is looked upon as an enemy of the human\r\nrace, and the whole of mankind is against him.\r\n\r\nu\r\n[ See Appendix, I.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that provincial institutions are useful to all nations, but\r\nnowhere do they appear to me to be more indispensable than amongst a\r\ndemocratic people. In an aristocracy order can always be maintained in\r\nthe midst of liberty, and as the rulers have a great deal to lose order\r\nis to them a first-rate consideration. In like manner an aristocracy\r\nprotects the people from the excesses of despotism, because it always\r\npossesses an organized power ready to resist a despot. But a democracy\r\nwithout provincial institutions has no security against these evils.\r\nHow can a populace, unaccustomed to freedom in small concerns, learn to\r\nuse it temperately in great affairs? What resistance can be offered to\r\ntyranny in a country where every private individual is impotent, and\r\nwhere the citizens are united by no common tie? Those who dread the\r\nlicense of the mob, and those who fear the rule of absolute power,\r\nought alike to desire the progressive growth of provincial liberties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am convinced that democratic nations are most\r\nexposed to fall beneath the yoke of a central administration, for\r\nseveral reasons, amongst which is the following. The constant tendency\r\nof these nations is to concentrate all the strength of the Government\r\nin the hands of the only power which directly represents the people,\r\nbecause beyond the people nothing is to be perceived but a mass of\r\nequal individuals confounded together. But when the same power is\r\nalready in possession of all the attributes of the Government, it can\r\nscarcely refrain from penetrating into the details of the\r\nadministration, and an opportunity of doing so is sure to present\r\nitself in the end, as was the case in France. In the French Revolution\r\nthere were two impulses in opposite directions, which must never be\r\nconfounded\xe2\x80\x94the one was favorable to liberty, the other to despotism.\r\nUnder the ancient monarchy the King was the sole author of the laws,\r\nand below the power of the sovereign certain vestiges of provincial\r\ninstitutions, half destroyed, were still distinguishable. These\r\nprovincial institutions were incoherent, ill compacted, and frequently\r\nabsurd; in the hands of the aristocracy they had sometimes been\r\nconverted into instruments of oppression. The Revolution declared\r\nitself the enemy of royalty and of provincial institutions at the same\r\ntime; it confounded all that had preceded it\xe2\x80\x94despotic power and the\r\nchecks to its abuses\xe2\x80\x94in indiscriminate hatred, and its tendency was at\r\nonce to overthrow and to centralize. This double character of the\r\nFrench Revolution is a fact which has been adroitly handled by the\r\nfriends of absolute power. Can they be accused of laboring in the cause\r\nof despotism when they are defending that central administration which\r\nwas one of the great innovations of the Revolution? *v In this manner\r\npopularity may be conciliated with hostility to the rights of the\r\npeople, and the secret slave of tyranny may be the professed admirer of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ See Appendix K.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have visited the two nations in which the system of provincial\r\nliberty has been most perfectly established, and I have listened to the\r\nopinions of different parties in those countries. In America I met with\r\nmen who secretly aspired to destroy the democratic institutions of the\r\nUnion; in England I found others who attacked the aristocracy openly,\r\nbut I know of no one who does not regard provincial independence as a\r\ngreat benefit. In both countries I have heard a thousand different\r\ncauses assigned for the evils of the State, but the local system was\r\nnever mentioned amongst them. I have heard citizens attribute the power\r\nand prosperity of their country to a multitude of reasons, but they all\r\nplaced the advantages of local institutions in the foremost rank. Am I\r\nto suppose that when men who are naturally so divided on religious\r\nopinions and on political theories agree on one point (and that one of\r\nwhich they have daily experience), they are all in error? The only\r\nnations which deny the utility of provincial liberties are those which\r\nhave fewest of them; in other words, those who are unacquainted with\r\nthe institution are the only persons who pass a censure upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter VI: Judicial Power In The United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans have retained the characteristics of judicial power\r\nwhich are common to all nations\xe2\x80\x94They have, however, made it a powerful\r\npolitical organ\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x94In what the judicial system of the Anglo-Americans\r\ndiffers from that of all other nations\xe2\x80\x94Why the American judges have the\r\nright of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94How they use this\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94Precautions taken by the legislator to prevent its abuse.\r\n\r\nJudicial Power In The United States And Its Influence On Political\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nI have thought it essential to devote a separate chapter to the\r\njudicial authorities of the United States, lest their great political\r\nimportance should be lessened in the reader\xe2\x80\x99s eyes by a merely\r\nincidental mention of them. Confederations have existed in other\r\ncountries beside America, and republics have not been established upon\r\nthe shores of the New World alone; the representative system of\r\ngovernment has been adopted in several States of Europe, but I am not\r\naware that any nation of the globe has hitherto organized a judicial\r\npower on the principle now adopted by the Americans. The judicial\r\norganization of the United States is the institution which a stranger\r\nhas the greatest difficulty in understanding. He hears the authority of\r\na judge invoked in the political occurrences of every day, and he\r\nnaturally concludes that in the United States the judges are important\r\npolitical functionaries; nevertheless, when he examines the nature of\r\nthe tribunals, they offer nothing which is contrary to the usual habits\r\nand privileges of those bodies, and the magistrates seem to him to\r\ninterfere in public affairs of chance, but by a chance which recurs\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nWhen the Parliament of Paris remonstrated, or refused to enregister an\r\nedict, or when it summoned a functionary accused of malversation to its\r\nbar, its political influence as a judicial body was clearly visible;\r\nbut nothing of the kind is to be seen in the United States. The\r\nAmericans have retained all the ordinary characteristics of judicial\r\nauthority, and have carefully restricted its action to the ordinary\r\ncircle of its functions.\r\n\r\nThe first characteristic of judicial power in all nations is the duty\r\nof arbitration. But rights must be contested in order to warrant the\r\ninterference of a tribunal; and an action must be brought to obtain the\r\ndecision of a judge. As long, therefore, as the law is uncontested, the\r\njudicial authority is not called upon to discuss it, and it may exist\r\nwithout being perceived. When a judge in a given case attacks a law\r\nrelating to that case, he extends the circle of his customary duties,\r\nwithout however stepping beyond it; since he is in some measure obliged\r\nto decide upon the law in order to decide the case. But if he\r\npronounces upon a law without resting upon a case, he clearly steps\r\nbeyond his sphere, and invades that of the legislative authority.\r\n\r\nThe second characteristic of judicial power is that it pronounces on\r\nspecial cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge in deciding\r\na particular point destroys a general principle, by passing a judgment\r\nwhich tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and\r\nconsequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his\r\nfunctions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without\r\nhaving a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all\r\nnations have agreed to confine his authority, he assumes a more\r\nimportant, and perhaps a more useful, influence than that of the\r\nmagistrate, but he ceases to be a representative of the judicial power.\r\n\r\nThe third characteristic of the judicial power is its inability to act\r\nunless it is appealed to, or until it has taken cognizance of an\r\naffair. This characteristic is less general than the other two; but,\r\nnotwithstanding the exceptions, I think it may be regarded as\r\nessential. The judicial power is by its nature devoid of action; it\r\nmust be put in motion in order to produce a result. When it is called\r\nupon to repress a crime, it punishes the criminal; when a wrong is to\r\nbe redressed, it is ready to redress it; when an act requires\r\ninterpretation, it is prepared to interpret it; but it does not pursue\r\ncriminals, hunt out wrongs, or examine into evidence of its own accord.\r\nA judicial functionary who should open proceedings, and usurp the\r\ncensorship of the laws, would in some measure do violence to the\r\npassive nature of his authority.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics\r\nof the judicial power; an American judge can only pronounce a decision\r\nwhen litigation has arisen, he is only conversant with special cases,\r\nand he cannot act until the cause has been duly brought before the\r\ncourt. His position is therefore perfectly similar to that of the\r\nmagistrate of other nations; and he is nevertheless invested with\r\nimmense political power. If the sphere of his authority and his means\r\nof action are the same as those of other judges, it may be asked whence\r\nhe derives a power which they do not possess. The cause of this\r\ndifference lies in the simple fact that the Americans have acknowledged\r\nthe right of the judges to found their decisions on the constitution\r\nrather than on the laws. In other words, they have left them at liberty\r\nnot to apply such laws as may appear to them to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nI am aware that a similar right has been claimed\xe2\x80\x94but claimed in vain\xe2\x80\x94by\r\ncourts of justice in other countries; but in America it is recognized\r\nby all authorities; and not a party, nor so much as an individual, is\r\nfound to contest it. This fact can only be explained by the principles\r\nof the American constitution. In France the constitution is (or at\r\nleast is supposed to be) immutable; and the received theory is that no\r\npower has the right of changing any part of it. In England the\r\nParliament has an acknowledged right to modify the constitution; as,\r\ntherefore, the constitution may undergo perpetual changes, it does not\r\nin reality exist; the Parliament is at once a legislative and a\r\nconstituent assembly. The political theories of America are more simple\r\nand more rational. An American constitution is not supposed to be\r\nimmutable as in France, nor is it susceptible of modification by the\r\nordinary powers of society as in England. It constitutes a detached\r\nwhole, which, as it represents the determination of the whole people,\r\nis no less binding on the legislator than on the private citizen, but\r\nwhich may be altered by the will of the people in predetermined cases,\r\naccording to established rules. In America the constitution may\r\ntherefore vary, but as long as it exists it is the origin of all\r\nauthority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating force. *a\r\n\r\na\r\n[ [The fifth article of the original Constitution of the United States\r\nprovides the mode in which amendments of the Constitution may be made.\r\nAmendments must be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress,\r\nand ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several\r\nStates. Fifteen amendments of the Constitution have been made at\r\ndifferent times since 1789, the most important of which are the\r\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, framed and ratified after the\r\nCivil War. The original Constitution of the United States, followed by\r\nthese fifteen amendments, is printed at the end of this edition.\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note, 1874.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must act upon\r\nthe position and the rights of the judicial bodies in the three\r\ncountries I have cited. If in France the tribunals were authorized to\r\ndisobey the laws on the ground of their being opposed to the\r\nconstitution, the supreme power would in fact be placed in their hands,\r\nsince they alone would have the right of interpreting a constitution,\r\nthe clauses of which can be modified by no authority. They would\r\ntherefore take the place of the nation, and exercise as absolute a sway\r\nover society as the inherent weakness of judicial power would allow\r\nthem to do. Undoubtedly, as the French judges are incompetent to\r\ndeclare a law to be unconstitutional, the power of changing the\r\nconstitution is indirectly given to the legislative body, since no\r\nlegal barrier would oppose the alterations which it might prescribe.\r\nBut it is better to grant the power of changing the constitution of the\r\npeople to men who represent (however imperfectly) the will of the\r\npeople, than to men who represent no one but themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would be still more unreasonable to invest the English judges with\r\nthe right of resisting the decisions of the legislative body, since the\r\nParliament which makes the laws also makes the constitution; and\r\nconsequently a law emanating from the three powers of the State can in\r\nno case be unconstitutional. But neither of these remarks is applicable\r\nto America.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the constitution governs the legislator as much as\r\nthe private citizen; as it is the first of laws it cannot be modified\r\nby a law, and it is therefore just that the tribunals should obey the\r\nconstitution in preference to any law. This condition is essential to\r\nthe power of the judicature, for to select that legal obligation by\r\nwhich he is most strictly bound is the natural right of every\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nIn France the constitution is also the first of laws, and the judges\r\nhave the same right to take it as the ground of their decisions, but\r\nwere they to exercise this right they must perforce encroach on rights\r\nmore sacred than their own, namely, on those of society, in whose name\r\nthey are acting. In this case the State-motive clearly prevails over\r\nthe motives of an individual. In America, where the nation can always\r\nreduce its magistrates to obedience by changing its constitution, no\r\ndanger of this kind is to be feared. Upon this point, therefore, the\r\npolitical and the logical reasons agree, and the people as well as the\r\njudges preserve their privileges.\r\n\r\nWhenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is argued\r\nin a tribunal of the United States he may refuse to admit it as a rule;\r\nthis power is the only one which is peculiar to the American\r\nmagistrate, but it gives rise to immense political influence. Few laws\r\ncan escape the searching analysis of the judicial power for any length\r\nof time, for there are few which are not prejudicial to some private\r\ninterest or other, and none which may not be brought before a court of\r\njustice by the choice of parties, or by the necessity of the case. But\r\nfrom the time that a judge has refused to apply any given law in a\r\ncase, that law loses a portion of its moral cogency. The persons to\r\nwhose interests it is prejudicial learn that means exist of evading its\r\nauthority, and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes\r\npowerless. One of two alternatives must then be resorted to: the people\r\nmust alter the constitution, or the legislature must repeal the law.\r\nThe political power which the Americans have intrusted to their courts\r\nof justice is therefore immense, but the evils of this power are\r\nconsiderably diminished by the obligation which has been imposed of\r\nattacking the laws through the courts of justice alone. If the judge\r\nhad been empowered to contest the laws on the ground of theoretical\r\ngeneralities, if he had been enabled to open an attack or to pass a\r\ncensure on the legislator, he would have played a prominent part in the\r\npolitical sphere; and as the champion or the antagonist of a party, he\r\nwould have arrayed the hostile passions of the nation in the conflict.\r\nBut when a judge contests a law applied to some particular case in an\r\nobscure proceeding, the importance of his attack is concealed from the\r\npublic gaze, his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and\r\nif the law is slighted it is only collaterally. Moreover, although it\r\nis censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished,\r\nbut its cogency is by no means suspended, and its final destruction can\r\nonly be accomplished by the reiterated attacks of judicial\r\nfunctionaries. It will readily be understood that by connecting the\r\ncensorship of the laws with the private interests of members of the\r\ncommunity, and by intimately uniting the prosecution of the law with\r\nthe prosecution of an individual, legislation is protected from wanton\r\nassailants, and from the daily aggressions of party spirit. The errors\r\nof the legislator are exposed whenever their evil consequences are most\r\nfelt, and it is always a positive and appreciable fact which serves as\r\nthe basis of a prosecution.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at\r\nonce the most favorable to liberty as well as to public order. If the\r\njudge could only attack the legislator openly and directly, he would\r\nsometimes be afraid to oppose any resistance to his will; and at other\r\nmoments party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn. The\r\nlaws would consequently be attacked when the power from which they\r\nemanate is weak, and obeyed when it is strong. That is to say, when it\r\nwould be useful to respect them they would be contested, and when it\r\nwould be easy to convert them into an instrument of oppression they\r\nwould be respected. But the American judge is brought into the\r\npolitical arena independently of his own will. He only judges the law\r\nbecause he is obliged to judge a case. The political question which he\r\nis called upon to resolve is connected with the interest of the\r\nsuitors, and he cannot refuse to decide it without abdicating the\r\nduties of his post. He performs his functions as a citizen by\r\nfulfilling the precise duties which belong to his profession as a\r\nmagistrate. It is true that upon this system the judicial censorship\r\nwhich is exercised by the courts of justice over the legislation cannot\r\nextend to all laws indiscriminately, inasmuch as some of them can never\r\ngive rise to that exact species of contestation which is termed a\r\nlawsuit; and even when such a contestation is possible, it may happen\r\nthat no one cares to bring it before a court of justice. The Americans\r\nhave often felt this disadvantage, but they have left the remedy\r\nincomplete, lest they should give it an efficacy which might in some\r\ncases prove dangerous. Within these limits the power vested in the\r\nAmerican courts of justice of pronouncing a statute to be\r\nunconstitutional forms one of the most powerful barriers which has ever\r\nbeen devised against the tyranny of political assemblies.\r\n\r\nOther Powers Granted To American Judges\r\n\r\nThe United States all the citizens have the right of indicting public\r\nfunctionaries before the ordinary tribunals\xe2\x80\x94How they use this\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94Art. 75 of the French Constitution of the An VIII\xe2\x80\x94The Americans\r\nand the English cannot understand the purport of this clause.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly natural that in a free country like America all the\r\ncitizens should have the right of indicting public functionaries before\r\nthe ordinary tribunals, and that all the judges should have the power\r\nof punishing public offences. The right granted to the courts of\r\njustice of judging the agents of the executive government, when they\r\nhave violated the laws, is so natural a one that it cannot be looked\r\nupon as an extraordinary privilege. Nor do the springs of government\r\nappear to me to be weakened in the United States by the custom which\r\nrenders all public officers responsible to the judges of the land. The\r\nAmericans seem, on the contrary, to have increased by this means that\r\nrespect which is due to the authorities, and at the same time to have\r\nrendered those who are in power more scrupulous of offending public\r\nopinion. I was struck by the small number of political trials which\r\noccur in the United States, but I had no difficulty in accounting for\r\nthis circumstance. A lawsuit, of whatever nature it may be, is always a\r\ndifficult and expensive undertaking. It is easy to attack a public man\r\nin a journal, but the motives which can warrant an action at law must\r\nbe serious. A solid ground of complaint must therefore exist to induce\r\nan individual to prosecute a public officer, and public officers are\r\ncareful not to furnish these grounds of complaint when they are afraid\r\nof being prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThis does not depend upon the republican form of American institutions,\r\nfor the same facts present themselves in England. These two nations do\r\nnot regard the impeachment of the principal officers of State as a\r\nsufficient guarantee of their independence. But they hold that the\r\nright of minor prosecutions, which are within the reach of the whole\r\ncommunity, is a better pledge of freedom than those great judicial\r\nactions which are rarely employed until it is too late.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, when it was very difficult to overtake offenders,\r\nthe judges inflicted the most dreadful tortures on the few who were\r\narrested, which by no means diminished the number of crimes. It has\r\nsince been discovered that when justice is more certain and more mild,\r\nit is at the same time more efficacious. The English and the Americans\r\nhold that tyranny and oppression are to be treated like any other\r\ncrime, by lessening the penalty and facilitating conviction.\r\n\r\nIn the year VIII of the French Republic a constitution was drawn up in\r\nwhich the following clause was introduced: \xe2\x80\x9cArt. 75. All the agents of\r\nthe government below the rank of ministers can only be prosecuted for\r\noffences relating to their several functions by virtue of a decree of\r\nthe Conseil d\xe2\x80\x99Etat; in which the case the prosecution takes place\r\nbefore the ordinary tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d This clause survived the \xe2\x80\x9cConstitution\r\nde l\xe2\x80\x99An VIII,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is still maintained in spite of the just\r\ncomplaints of the nation. I have always found the utmost difficulty in\r\nexplaining its meaning to Englishmen or Americans. They were at once\r\nled to conclude that the Conseil d\xe2\x80\x99Etat in France was a great tribunal,\r\nestablished in the centre of the kingdom, which exercised a preliminary\r\nand somewhat tyrannical jurisdiction in all political causes. But when\r\nI told them that the Conseil d\xe2\x80\x99Etat was not a judicial body, in the\r\ncommon sense of the term, but an administrative council composed of men\r\ndependent on the Crown, so that the king, after having ordered one of\r\nhis servants, called a Prefect, to commit an injustice, has the power\r\nof commanding another of his servants, called a Councillor of State, to\r\nprevent the former from being punished; when I demonstrated to them\r\nthat the citizen who has been injured by the order of the sovereign is\r\nobliged to solicit from the sovereign permission to obtain redress,\r\nthey refused to credit so flagrant an abuse, and were tempted to accuse\r\nme of falsehood or of ignorance. It frequently happened before the\r\nRevolution that a Parliament issued a warrant against a public officer\r\nwho had committed an offence, and sometimes the proceedings were\r\nstopped by the authority of the Crown, which enforced compliance with\r\nits absolute and despotic will. It is painful to perceive how much\r\nlower we are sunk than our forefathers, since we allow things to pass\r\nunder the color of justice and the sanction of the law which violence\r\nalone could impose upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter VII: Political Jurisdiction In The United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinition of political jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94What is understood by political\r\njurisdiction in France, in England, and in the United States\xe2\x80\x94In America\r\nthe political judge can only pass sentence on public officers\xe2\x80\x94He more\r\nfrequently passes a sentence of removal from office than a\r\npenalty\xe2\x80\x94Political jurisdiction as it exists in the United States is,\r\nnotwithstanding its mildness, and perhaps in consequence of that\r\nmildness, a most powerful instrument in the hands of the majority.\r\n\r\nPolitical Jurisdiction In The United States\r\n\r\nI understand, by political jurisdiction, that temporary right of\r\npronouncing a legal decision with which a political body may be\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nIn absolute governments no utility can accrue from the introduction of\r\nextraordinary forms of procedure; the prince in whose name an offender\r\nis prosecuted is as much the sovereign of the courts of justice as of\r\neverything else, and the idea which is entertained of his power is of\r\nitself a sufficient security. The only thing he has to fear is, that\r\nthe external formalities of justice should be neglected, and that his\r\nauthority should be dishonored from a wish to render it more absolute.\r\nBut in most free countries, in which the majority can never exercise\r\nthe same influence upon the tribunals as an absolute monarch, the\r\njudicial power has occasionally been vested for a time in the\r\nrepresentatives of the nation. It has been thought better to introduce\r\na temporary confusion between the functions of the different\r\nauthorities than to violate the necessary principle of the unity of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nEngland, France, and the United States have established this political\r\njurisdiction by law; and it is curious to examine the different\r\nadaptations which these three great nations have made of the principle.\r\nIn England and in France the House of Lords and the Chambre des Paris\r\n*a constitute the highest criminal court of their respective nations,\r\nand although they do not habitually try all political offences, they\r\nare competent to try them all. Another political body enjoys the right\r\nof impeachment before the House of Lords: the only difference which\r\nexists between the two countries in this respect is, that in England\r\nthe Commons may impeach whomsoever they please before the Lords, whilst\r\nin France the Deputies can only employ this mode of prosecution against\r\nthe ministers of the Crown.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ [As it existed under the constitutional monarchy down to 1848.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn both countries the Upper House may make use of all the existing\r\npenal laws of the nation to punish the delinquents.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as well as in Europe, one branch of the\r\nlegislature is authorized to impeach and another to judge: the House of\r\nRepresentatives arraigns the offender, and the Senate awards his\r\nsentence. But the Senate can only try such persons as are brought\r\nbefore it by the House of Representatives, and those persons must\r\nbelong to the class of public functionaries. Thus the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Senate is less extensive than that of the Peers of France, whilst\r\nthe right of impeachment by the Representatives is more general than\r\nthat of the Deputies. But the great difference which exists between\r\nEurope and America is, that in Europe political tribunals are empowered\r\nto inflict all the dispositions of the penal code, while in America,\r\nwhen they have deprived the offender of his official rank, and have\r\ndeclared him incapable of filling any political office for the future,\r\ntheir jurisdiction terminates and that of the ordinary tribunals\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that the President of the United States has\r\ncommitted the crime of high treason; the House of Representatives\r\nimpeaches him, and the Senate degrades him; he must then be tried by a\r\njury, which alone can deprive him of his liberty or his life. This\r\naccurately illustrates the subject we are treating. The political\r\njurisdiction which is established by the laws of Europe is intended to\r\ntry great offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or their\r\npowers in the State; and to this end all the privileges of the courts\r\nof justice are temporarily extended to a great political assembly. The\r\nlegislator is then transformed into the magistrate; he is called upon\r\nto admit, to distinguish, and to punish the offence; and as he\r\nexercises all the authority of a judge, the law restricts him to the\r\nobservance of all the duties of that high office, and of all the\r\nformalities of justice. When a public functionary is impeached before\r\nan English or a French political tribunal, and is found guilty, the\r\nsentence deprives him ipso facto of his functions, and it may pronounce\r\nhim to be incapable of resuming them or any others for the future. But\r\nin this case the political interdict is a consequence of the sentence,\r\nand not the sentence itself. In Europe the sentence of a political\r\ntribunal is to be regarded as a judicial verdict rather than as an\r\nadministrative measure. In the United States the contrary takes place;\r\nand although the decision of the Senate is judicial in its form, since\r\nthe Senators are obliged to comply with the practices and formalities\r\nof a court of justice; although it is judicial in respect to the\r\nmotives on which it is founded, since the Senate is in general obliged\r\nto take an offence at common law as the basis of its sentence;\r\nnevertheless the object of the proceeding is purely administrative. If\r\nit had been the intention of the American legislator to invest a\r\npolitical body with great judicial authority, its action would not have\r\nbeen limited to the circle of public functionaries, since the most\r\ndangerous enemies of the State may be in the possession of no functions\r\nat all; and this is especially true in republics, where party influence\r\nis the first of authorities, and where the strength of many a reader is\r\nincreased by his exercising no legal power.\r\n\r\nIf it had been the intention of the American legislator to give society\r\nthe means of repressing State offences by exemplary punishment,\r\naccording to the practice of ordinary justice, the resources of the\r\npenal code would all have been placed at the disposal of the political\r\ntribunals. But the weapon with which they are intrusted is an imperfect\r\none, and it can never reach the most dangerous offenders, since men who\r\naim at the entire subversion of the laws are not likely to murmur at a\r\npolitical interdict.\r\n\r\nThe main object of the political jurisdiction which obtains in the\r\nUnited States is, therefore, to deprive the ill-disposed citizen of an\r\nauthority which he has used amiss, and to prevent him from ever\r\nacquiring it again. This is evidently an administrative measure\r\nsanctioned by the formalities of a judicial decision. In this matter\r\nthe Americans have created a mixed system; they have surrounded the act\r\nwhich removes a public functionary with the securities of a political\r\ntrial; and they have deprived all political condemnations of their\r\nseverest penalties. Every link of the system may easily be traced from\r\nthis point; we at once perceive why the American constitutions subject\r\nall the civil functionaries to the jurisdiction of the Senate, whilst\r\nthe military, whose crimes are nevertheless more formidable, are\r\nexempted from that tribunal. In the civil service none of the American\r\nfunctionaries can be said to be removable; the places which some of\r\nthem occupy are inalienable, and the others are chosen for a term which\r\ncannot be shortened. It is therefore necessary to try them all in order\r\nto deprive them of their authority. But military officers are dependent\r\non the chief magistrate of the State, who is himself a civil\r\nfunctionary, and the decision which condemns him is a blow upon them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIf we now compare the American and the European systems, we shall meet\r\nwith differences no less striking in the different effects which each\r\nof them produces or may produce. In France and in England the\r\njurisdiction of political bodies is looked upon as an extraordinary\r\nresource, which is only to be employed in order to rescue society from\r\nunwonted dangers. It is not to be denied that these tribunals, as they\r\nare constituted in Europe, are apt to violate the conservative\r\nprinciple of the balance of power in the State, and to threaten\r\nincessantly the lives and liberties of the subject. The same political\r\njurisdiction in the United States is only indirectly hostile to the\r\nbalance of power; it cannot menace the lives of the citizens, and it\r\ndoes not hover, as in Europe, over the heads of the community, since\r\nthose only who have submitted to its authority on accepting office are\r\nexposed to the severity of its investigations. It is at the same time\r\nless formidable and less efficacious; indeed, it has not been\r\nconsidered by the legislators of the United States as a remedy for the\r\nmore violent evils of society, but as an ordinary means of conducting\r\nthe government. In this respect it probably exercises more real\r\ninfluence on the social body in America than in Europe. We must not be\r\nmisled by the apparent mildness of the American legislation in all that\r\nrelates to political jurisdiction. It is to be observed, in the first\r\nplace, that in the United States the tribunal which passes sentence is\r\ncomposed of the same elements, and subject to the same influences, as\r\nthe body which impeaches the offender, and that this uniformity gives\r\nan almost irresistible impulse to the vindictive passions of parties.\r\nIf political judges in the United States cannot inflict such heavy\r\npenalties as those of Europe, there is the less chance of their\r\nacquitting a prisoner; and the conviction, if it is less formidable, is\r\nmore certain. The principal object of the political tribunals of Europe\r\nis to punish the offender; the purpose of those in America is to\r\ndeprive him of his authority. A political condemnation in the United\r\nStates may, therefore, be looked upon as a preventive measure; and\r\nthere is no reason for restricting the judges to the exact definitions\r\nof criminal law. Nothing can be more alarming than the excessive\r\nlatitude with which political offences are described in the laws of\r\nAmerica. Article II., Section 4, of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates runs thus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe President, Vice-President, and all civil\r\nofficers of the United States shall be removed from office on\r\nimpeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors.\xe2\x80\x9d Many of the Constitutions of the States are\r\neven less explicit. \xe2\x80\x9cPublic officers,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Constitution of\r\nMassachusetts, *b \xe2\x80\x9cshall be impeached for misconduct or\r\nmaladministration;\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution of Virginia declares that all the\r\ncivil officers who shall have offended against the State, by\r\nmaladministration, corruption, or other high crimes, may be impeached\r\nby the House of Delegates; in some constitutions no offences are\r\nspecified, in order to subject the public functionaries to an unlimited\r\nresponsibility. *c But I will venture to affirm that it is precisely\r\ntheir mildness which renders the American laws most formidable in this\r\nrespect. We have shown that in Europe the removal of a functionary and\r\nhis political interdiction are the consequences of the penalty he is to\r\nundergo, and that in America they constitute the penalty itself. The\r\nconsequence is that in Europe political tribunals are invested with\r\nrights which they are afraid to use, and that the fear of punishing too\r\nmuch hinders them from punishing at all. But in America no one\r\nhesitates to inflict a penalty from which humanity does not recoil. To\r\ncondemn a political opponent to death, in order to deprive him of his\r\npower, is to commit what all the world would execrate as a horrible\r\nassassination; but to declare that opponent unworthy to exercise that\r\nauthority, to deprive him of it, and to leave him uninjured in life and\r\nlimb, may be judged to be the fair issue of the struggle. But this\r\nsentence, which it is so easy to pronounce, is not the less fatally\r\nsevere to the majority of those upon whom it is inflicted. Great\r\ncriminals may undoubtedly brave its intangible rigor, but ordinary\r\noffenders will dread it as a condemnation which destroys their position\r\nin the world, casts a blight upon their honor, and condemns them to a\r\nshameful inactivity worse than death. The influence exercised in the\r\nUnited States upon the progress of society by the jurisdiction of\r\npolitical bodies may not appear to be formidable, but it is only the\r\nmore immense. It does not directly coerce the subject, but it renders\r\nthe majority more absolute over those in power; it does not confer an\r\nunbounded authority on the legislator which can be exerted at some\r\nmomentous crisis, but it establishes a temperate and regular influence,\r\nwhich is at all times available. If the power is decreased, it can, on\r\nthe other hand, be more conveniently employed and more easily abused.\r\nBy preventing political tribunals from inflicting judicial punishments\r\nthe Americans seem to have eluded the worst consequences of legislative\r\ntyranny, rather than tyranny itself; and I am not sure that political\r\njurisdiction, as it is constituted in the United States, is not the\r\nmost formidable weapon which has ever been placed in the rude grasp of\r\na popular majority. When the American republics begin to degenerate it\r\nwill be easy to verify the truth of this observation, by remarking\r\nwhether the number of political impeachments augments.*d\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ Chap.

But all the States\r\nwhich I have considered as independent are forced to submit, in certain\r\ncases, to the supreme authority of the Union. The time is now come for\r\nme to examine separately the supremacy with which the Union has been\r\ninvested, and to cast a rapid glance over the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of the first Union\xe2\x80\x94Its weakness\xe2\x80\x94Congress appeals to the\r\nconstituent authority\xe2\x80\x94Interval of two years between this appeal and the\r\npromulgation of the new Constitution.\r\n\r\nHistory Of The Federal Constitution\r\n\r\nThe thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the yoke of\r\nEngland towards the end of the last century professed, as I have\r\nalready observed, the same religion, the same language, the same\r\ncustoms, and almost the same laws; they were struggling against a\r\ncommon enemy; and these reasons were sufficiently strong to unite them\r\none to another, and to consolidate them into one nation. But as each of\r\nthem had enjoyed a separate existence and a government within its own\r\ncontrol, the peculiar interests and customs which resulted from this\r\nsystem were opposed to a compact and intimate union which would have\r\nabsorbed the individual importance of each in the general importance of\r\nall. Hence arose two opposite tendencies, the one prompting the\r\nAnglo-Americans to unite, the other to divide their strength. As long\r\nas the war with the mother-country lasted the principle of union was\r\nkept alive by necessity; and although the laws which constituted it\r\nwere defective, the common tie subsisted in spite of their\r\nimperfections. *a But no sooner was peace concluded than the faults of\r\nthe legislation became manifest, and the State seemed to be suddenly\r\ndissolved. Each colony became an independent republic, and assumed an\r\nabsolute sovereignty. The federal government, condemned to impotence by\r\nits constitution, and no longer sustained by the presence of a common\r\ndanger, witnessed the outrages offered to its flag by the great nations\r\nof Europe, whilst it was scarcely able to maintain its ground against\r\nthe Indian tribes, and to pay the interest of the debt which had been\r\ncontracted during the war of independence. It was already on the verge\r\nof destruction, when it officially proclaimed its inability to conduct\r\nthe government, and appealed to the constituent authority of the\r\nnation. *b If America ever approached (for however brief a time) that\r\nlofty pinnacle of glory to which the fancy of its inhabitants is wont\r\nto point, it was at the solemn moment at which the power of the nation\r\nabdicated, as it were, the empire of the land. All ages have furnished\r\nthe spectacle of a people struggling with energy to win its\r\nindependence; and the efforts of the Americans in throwing off the\r\nEnglish yoke have been considerably exaggerated. Separated from their\r\nenemies by three thousand miles of ocean, and backed by a powerful\r\nally, the success of the United States may be more justly attributed to\r\ntheir geographical position than to the valor of their armies or the\r\npatriotism of their citizens. It would be ridiculous to compare the\r\nAmerican was to the wars of the French Revolution, or the efforts of\r\nthe Americans to those of the French when they were attacked by the\r\nwhole of Europe, without credit and without allies, yet capable of\r\nopposing a twentieth part of their population to the world, and of\r\nbearing the torch of revolution beyond their frontiers whilst they\r\nstifled its devouring flame within the bosom of their country. But it\r\nis a novelty in the history of society to see a great people turn a\r\ncalm and scrutinizing eye upon itself, when apprised by the legislature\r\nthat the wheels of government are stopped; to see it carefully examine\r\nthe extent of the evil, and patiently wait for two whole years until a\r\nremedy was discovered, which it voluntarily adopted without having\r\nwrung a tear or a drop of blood from mankind. At the time when the\r\ninadequacy of the first constitution was discovered America possessed\r\nthe double advantage of that calm which had succeeded the effervescence\r\nof the revolution, and of those great men who had led the revolution to\r\na successful issue. The assembly which accepted the task of composing\r\nthe second constitution was small; *c but George Washington was its\r\nPresident, and it contained the choicest talents and the noblest hearts\r\nwhich had ever appeared in the New World. This national commission,\r\nafter long and mature deliberation, offered to the acceptance of the\r\npeople the body of general laws which still rules the Union. All the\r\nStates adopted it successively. *d The new Federal Government commenced\r\nits functions in 1789, after an interregnum of two years. The\r\nRevolution of America terminated when that of France began.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ See the articles of the first confederation formed in 1778.

It was as impossible to determine beforehand,\r\nwith any degree of accuracy, the share of authority which each of two\r\ngovernments was to enjoy, as to foresee all the incidents in the\r\nexistence of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe obligations and the claims of the Federal Government were simple\r\nand easily definable, because the Union had been formed with the\r\nexpress purpose of meeting the general exigencies of the people; but\r\nthe claims and obligations of the States were, on the other hand,\r\ncomplicated and various, because those Governments had penetrated into\r\nall the details of social life. The attributes of the Federal\r\nGovernment were therefore carefully enumerated and all that was not\r\nincluded amongst them was declared to constitute a part of the\r\nprivileges of the several Governments of the States. Thus the\r\ngovernment of the States remained the rule, and that of the\r\nConfederation became the exception. *e\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ See the Amendment to the Federal Constitution; \xe2\x80\x9cFederalist,\xe2\x80\x9d No. 32;\r\nStory, p. 711; Kent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 364.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that whenever the exclusive right of regulating\r\ncertain matters is not reserved to Congress by the Constitution, the\r\nStates may take up the affair until it is brought before the National\r\nAssembly. For instance, Congress has the right of making a general law\r\non bankruptcy, which, however, it neglects to do. Each State is then at\r\nliberty to make a law for itself. This point has been established by\r\ndiscussion in the law-courts, and may be said to belong more properly\r\nto jurisprudence.]\r\n\r\nBut as it was foreseen that, in practice, questions might arise as to\r\nthe exact limits of this exceptional authority, and that it would be\r\ndangerous to submit these questions to the decision of the ordinary\r\ncourts of justice, established in the States by the States themselves,\r\na high Federal court was created, *f which was destined, amongst other\r\nfunctions, to maintain the balance of power which had been established\r\nby the Constitution between the two rival Governments. *g\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ The action of this court is indirect, as we shall hereafter show.]\r\n\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ It is thus that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist,\xe2\x80\x9d No. 45, explains the division of\r\nsupremacy between the Union and the States: \xe2\x80\x9cThe powers delegated by\r\nthe Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined.

The powers\r\nreserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in\r\nthe ordinary course of affairs, concern the internal order and\r\nprosperity of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d I shall often have occasion to quote \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nFederalist\xe2\x80\x9d in this work.

They\r\nentitled their journal \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist,\xe2\x80\x9d a name which has been retained\r\nin the work. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist\xe2\x80\x9d is an excellent book, which ought to be\r\nfamiliar to the statesmen of all countries, although it especially\r\nconcerns America.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerogative Of The Federal Government\r\n\r\nPower of declaring war, making peace, and levying general taxes vested\r\nin the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x94What part of the internal policy of the\r\ncountry it may direct\xe2\x80\x94The Government of the Union in some respects more\r\ncentral than the King\xe2\x80\x99s Government in the old French monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe external relations of a people may be compared to those of private\r\nindividuals, and they cannot be advantageously maintained without the\r\nagency of a single head of a Government. The exclusive right of making\r\npeace and war, of concluding treaties of commerce, of raising armies,\r\nand equipping fleets, was granted to the Union. *h The necessity of a\r\nnational Government was less imperiously felt in the conduct of the\r\ninternal policy of society; but there are certain general interests\r\nwhich can only be attended to with advantage by a general authority.\r\nThe Union was invested with the power of controlling the monetary\r\nsystem, of directing the post office, and of opening the great roads\r\nwhich were to establish a communication between the different parts of\r\nthe country. *i The independence of the Government of each State was\r\nformally recognized in its sphere; nevertheless, the Federal Government\r\nwas authorized to interfere in the internal affairs of the States *j in\r\na few predetermined cases, in which an indiscreet abuse of their\r\nindependence might compromise the security of the Union at large. Thus,\r\nwhilst the power of modifying and changing their legislation at\r\npleasure was preserved in all the republics, they were forbidden to\r\nenact ex post facto laws, or to create a class of nobles in their\r\ncommunity. *k Lastly, as it was necessary that the Federal Government\r\nshould be able to fulfil its engagements, it was endowed with an\r\nunlimited power of levying taxes. *l\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ See Constitution, sect. 8; \xe2\x80\x9cFederalist,\xe2\x80\x9d Nos. 41 and 42; Kent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 207; Story, pp. 358-382; Ibid. pp. 409-426.]\r\n\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ Several other privileges of the same kind exist, such as that which\r\nempowers the Union to legislate on bankruptcy, to grant patents, and\r\nother matters in which its intervention is clearly necessary.]\r\n\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ Even in these cases its interference is indirect.

The United States\r\nform not only a republic, but a confederation; nevertheless the\r\nauthority of the nation is more central than it was in several of the\r\nmonarchies of Europe when the American Constitution was formed. Take,\r\nfor instance, the two following examples.\r\n\r\nThirteen supreme courts of justice existed in France, which, generally\r\nspeaking, had the right of interpreting the law without appeal; and\r\nthose provinces which were styled pays d\xe2\x80\x99etats were authorized to\r\nrefuse their assent to an impost which had been levied by the sovereign\r\nwho represented the nation. In the Union there is but one tribunal to\r\ninterpret, as there is one legislature to make the laws; and an impost\r\nvoted by the representatives of the nation is binding upon all the\r\ncitizens. In these two essential points, therefore, the Union exercises\r\nmore central authority than the French monarchy possessed, although the\r\nUnion is only an assemblage of confederate republics.\r\n\r\nIn Spain certain provinces had the right of establishing a system of\r\ncustom-house duties peculiar to themselves, although that privilege\r\nbelongs, by its very nature, to the national sovereignty. In America\r\nthe Congress alone has the right of regulating the commercial relations\r\nof the States. The government of the Confederation is therefore more\r\ncentralized in this respect than the kingdom of Spain. It is true that\r\nthe power of the Crown in France or in Spain was always able to obtain\r\nby force whatever the Constitution of the country denied, and that the\r\nultimate result was consequently the same; but I am here discussing the\r\ntheory of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFederal Powers\r\n\r\nAfter having settled the limits within which the Federal Government was\r\nto act, the next point was to determine the powers which it was to\r\nexert.\r\n\r\nLegislative Powers *m\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ [In this chapter the author points out the essence of the conflict\r\nbetween the seceding States and the Union which caused the Civil War of\r\n1861.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nDivision of the Legislative Body into two branches\xe2\x80\x94Difference in the\r\nmanner of forming the two Houses\xe2\x80\x94The principle of the independence of\r\nthe States predominates in the formation of the Senate\xe2\x80\x94The principle of\r\nthe sovereignty of the nation in the composition of the House of\r\nRepresentatives\xe2\x80\x94Singular effects of the fact that a Constitution can\r\nonly be logical in the early stages of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe plan which had been laid down beforehand for the Constitutions of\r\nthe several States was followed, in many points, in the organization of\r\nthe powers of the Union. The Federal legislature of the Union was\r\ncomposed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. A spirit of\r\nconciliation prescribed the observance of distinct principles in the\r\nformation of these two assemblies. I have already shown that two\r\ncontrary interests were opposed to each other in the establishment of\r\nthe Federal Constitution. These two interests had given rise to two\r\nopinions. It was the wish of one party to convert the Union into a\r\nleague of independent States, or a sort of congress, at which the\r\nrepresentatives of the several peoples would meet to discuss certain\r\npoints of their common interests. The other party desired to unite the\r\ninhabitants of the American colonies into one sole nation, and to\r\nestablish a Government which should act as the sole representative of\r\nthe nation, as far as the limited sphere of its authority would permit.\r\nThe practical consequences of these two theories were exceedingly\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe question was, whether a league was to be established instead of a\r\nnational Government; whether the majority of the State, instead of the\r\nmajority of the inhabitants of the Union, was to give the law: for\r\nevery State, the small as well as the great, would then remain in the\r\nfull enjoyment of its independence, and enter the Union upon a footing\r\nof perfect equality. If, however, the inhabitants of the United States\r\nwere to be considered as belonging to one and the same nation, it would\r\nbe just that the majority of the citizens of the Union should prescribe\r\nthe law. Of course the lesser States could not subscribe to the\r\napplication of this doctrine without, in fact, abdicating their\r\nexistence in relation to the sovereignty of the Confederation; since\r\nthey would have passed from the condition of a co-equal and\r\nco-legislative authority to that of an insignificant fraction of a\r\ngreat people. But if the former system would have invested them with an\r\nexcessive authority, the latter would have annulled their influence\r\naltogether. Under these circumstances the result was, that the strict\r\nrules of logic were evaded, as is usually the case when interests are\r\nopposed to arguments. A middle course was hit upon by the legislators,\r\nwhich brought together by force two systems theoretically\r\nirreconcilable.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the independence of the States prevailed in the\r\nformation of the Senate, and that of the sovereignty of the nation\r\npredominated in the composition of the House of Representatives. It was\r\ndecided that each State should send two senators to Congress, and a\r\nnumber of representatives proportioned to its population. *n It results\r\nfrom this arrangement that the State of New York has at the present day\r\nforty representatives and only two senators; the State of Delaware has\r\ntwo senators and only one representative; the State of Delaware is\r\ntherefore equal to the State of New York in the Senate, whilst the\r\nlatter has forty times the influence of the former in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Thus, if the minority of the nation preponderates in\r\nthe Senate,. it may paralyze the decisions of the majority represented\r\nin the other House, which is contrary to the spirit of constitutional\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ Every ten years Congress fixes anew the number of representatives\r\nwhich each State is to furnish. The total number was 69 in 1789, and\r\n240 in 1833. (See \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Almanac,\xe2\x80\x9d 1834, p. 194.) The Constitution\r\ndecided that there should not be more than one representative for every\r\n30,000 persons; but no minimum was fixed on. The Congress has not\r\nthought fit to augment the number of representatives in proportion to\r\nthe increase of population. The first Act which was passed on the\r\nsubject (April 14, 1792: see \xe2\x80\x9cLaws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d by Story,\r\nvol. i. p. 235) decided that there should be one representative for\r\nevery 33,000 inhabitants. The last Act, which was passed in 1832, fixes\r\nthe proportion at one for 48,000. The population represented is\r\ncomposed of all the free men and of three-fifths of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The last Act of apportionment, passed February 2, 1872, fixes the\r\nrepresentation at one to 134,684 inhabitants. There are now (1875) 283\r\nmembers of the lower House of Congress, and 9 for the States at large,\r\nmaking in all 292 members. The old States have of course lost the\r\nrepresentatives which the new States have gained.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]]\r\n\r\nThese facts show how rare and how difficult it is rationally and\r\nlogically to combine all the several parts of legislation. In the\r\ncourse of time different interests arise, and different principles are\r\nsanctioned by the same people; and when a general constitution is to be\r\nestablished, these interests and principles are so many natural\r\nobstacles to the rigorous application of any political system, with all\r\nits consequences. The early stages of national existence are the only\r\nperiods at which it is possible to maintain the complete logic of\r\nlegislation; and when we perceive a nation in the enjoyment of this\r\nadvantage, before we hasten to conclude that it is wise, we should do\r\nwell to remember that it is young. When the Federal Constitution was\r\nformed, the interests of independence for the separate States, and the\r\ninterest of union for the whole people, were the only two conflicting\r\ninterests which existed amongst the Anglo-Americans, and a compromise\r\nwas necessarily made between them.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, just to acknowledge that this part of the Constitution\r\nhas not hitherto produced those evils which might have been feared. All\r\nthe States are young and contiguous; their customs, their ideas, and\r\ntheir exigencies are not dissimilar; and the differences which result\r\nfrom their size or inferiority do not suffice to set their interests at\r\nvariance. The small States have consequently never been induced to\r\nleague themselves together in the Senate to oppose the designs of the\r\nlarger ones; and indeed there is so irresistible an authority in the\r\nlegitimate expression of the will of a people that the Senate could\r\noffer but a feeble opposition to the vote of the majority of the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was not in the\r\npower of the American legislators to reduce to a single nation the\r\npeople for whom they were making laws. The object of the Federal\r\nConstitution was not to destroy the independence of the States, but to\r\nrestrain it. By acknowledging the real authority of these secondary\r\ncommunities (and it was impossible to deprive them of it), they\r\ndisavowed beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing g the\r\ndecisions of the majority. Upon this principle the introduction of the\r\ninfluence of the States into the mechanism of the Federal Government\r\nwas by no means to be wondered at, since it only attested the existence\r\nof an acknowledged power, which was to be humored and not forcibly\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\nA Further Difference Between The Senate And The House Of\r\nRepresentatives\r\n\r\nThe Senate named by the provincial legislators, the Representatives by\r\nthe people\xe2\x80\x94Double election of the former; single election of the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x94Term of the different offices\xe2\x80\x94Peculiar functions of each House.\r\n\r\nThe Senate not only differs from the other House in the principle which\r\nit represents, but also in the mode of its election, in the term for\r\nwhich it is chosen, and in the nature of its functions. The House of\r\nRepresentatives is named by the people, the Senate by the legislators\r\nof each State; the former is directly elected, the latter is elected by\r\nan elected body; the term for which the representatives are chosen is\r\nonly two years, that of the senators is six. The functions of the House\r\nof Representatives are purely legislative, and the only share it takes\r\nin the judicial power is in the impeachment of public officers. The\r\nSenate co-operates in the work of legislation, and tries those\r\npolitical offences which the House of Representatives submits to its\r\ndecision. It also acts as the great executive council of the nation;\r\nthe treaties which are concluded by the President must be ratified by\r\nthe Senate, and the appointments he may make must be definitely\r\napproved by the same body. *o\r\n\r\no\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist,\xe2\x80\x9d Nos. 52-56, inclusive; Story, pp. 199-314;\r\nConstitution of the United States, sects. 2 and 3.] The Executive Power\r\n*p\r\n\r\n\r\np\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist,\xe2\x80\x9d Nos. 67-77; Constitution of the United States,\r\nart. 2; Story, p. 315, pp. 615-780; Kent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 255.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDependence of the President\xe2\x80\x94He is elective and responsible\xe2\x80\x94He is free\r\nto act in his own sphere under the inspection, but not under the\r\ndirection, of the Senate\xe2\x80\x94His salary fixed at his entry into\r\noffice\xe2\x80\x94Suspensive veto.\r\n\r\nThe American legislators undertook a difficult task in attempting to\r\ncreate an executive power dependent on the majority of the people, and\r\nnevertheless sufficiently strong to act without restraint in its own\r\nsphere. It was indispensable to the maintenance of the republican form\r\nof government that the representative of the executive power should be\r\nsubject to the will of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe President is an elective magistrate. His honor, his property, his\r\nliberty, and his life are the securities which the people has for the\r\ntemperate use of his power. But in the exercise of his authority he\r\ncannot be said to be perfectly independent; the Senate takes cognizance\r\nof his relations with foreign powers, and of the distribution of public\r\nappointments, so that he can neither be bribed nor can he employ the\r\nmeans of corruption. The legislators of the Union acknowledged that the\r\nexecutive power would be incompetent to fulfil its task with dignity\r\nand utility, unless it enjoyed a greater degree of stability and of\r\nstrength than had been granted to it in the separate States.\r\n\r\nThe President is chosen for four years, and he may be reelected; so\r\nthat the chances of a prolonged administration may inspire him with\r\nhopeful undertakings for the public good, and with the means of\r\ncarrying them into execution. The President was made the sole\r\nrepresentative of the executive power of the Union, and care was taken\r\nnot to render his decisions subordinate to the vote of a council\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndangerous measure, which tends at the same time to clog the action of\r\nthe Government and to diminish its responsibility. The Senate has the\r\nright of annulling g certain acts of the President; but it cannot\r\ncompel him to take any steps, nor does it participate in the exercise\r\nof the executive power.\r\n\r\nThe action of the legislature on the executive power may be direct; and\r\nwe have just shown that the Americans carefully obviated this\r\ninfluence; but it may, on the other hand, be indirect. Public\r\nassemblies which have the power of depriving an officer of state of his\r\nsalary encroach upon his independence; and as they are free to make the\r\nlaws, it is to be feared lest they should gradually appropriate to\r\nthemselves a portion of that authority which the Constitution had\r\nvested in his hands. This dependence of the executive power is one of\r\nthe defects inherent in republican constitutions. The Americans have\r\nnot been able to counteract the tendency which legislative assemblies\r\nhave to get possession of the government, but they have rendered this\r\npropensity less irresistible. The salary of the President is fixed, at\r\nthe time of his entering upon office, for the whole period of his\r\nmagistracy. The President is, moreover, provided with a suspensive\r\nveto, which allows him to oppose the passing of such laws as might\r\ndestroy the portion of independence which the Constitution awards him.\r\nThe struggle between the President and the legislature must always be\r\nan unequal one, since the latter is certain of bearing down all\r\nresistance by persevering in its plans; but the suspensive veto forces\r\nit at least to reconsider the matter, and, if the motion be persisted\r\nin, it must then be backed by a majority of two-thirds of the whole\r\nhouse. The veto is, in fact, a sort of appeal to the people. The\r\nexecutive power, which, without this security, might have been secretly\r\noppressed, adopts this means of pleading its cause and stating its\r\nmotives. But if the legislature is certain of overpowering all\r\nresistance by persevering in its plans, I reply, that in the\r\nconstitutions of all nations, of whatever kind they may be, a certain\r\npoint exists at which the legislator is obliged to have recourse to the\r\ngood sense and the virtue of his fellow-citizens. This point is more\r\nprominent and more discoverable in republics, whilst it is more remote\r\nand more carefully concealed in monarchies, but it always exists\r\nsomewhere. There is no country in the world in which everything can be\r\nprovided for by the laws, or in which political institutions can prove\r\na substitute for common sense and public morality.\r\n\r\nDifferences Between The Position Of The President Of The United States\r\nAnd That Of A Constitutional King Of France\r\n\r\nExecutive power in the Northern States as limited and as partial as the\r\nsupremacy which it represents\xe2\x80\x94Executive power in France as universal as\r\nthe supremacy it represents\xe2\x80\x94The King a branch of the legislature\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nPresident the mere executor of the law\xe2\x80\x94Other differences resulting from\r\nthe duration of the two powers\xe2\x80\x94The President checked in the exercise of\r\nthe executive authority\xe2\x80\x94The King independent in its\r\nexercise\xe2\x80\x94Notwithstanding these discrepancies France is more akin to a\r\nrepublic than the Union to a monarchy\xe2\x80\x94Comparison of the number of\r\npublic officers depending upon the executive power in the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe executive power has so important an influence on the destinies of\r\nnations that I am inclined to pause for an instant at this portion of\r\nmy subject, in order more clearly to explain the part it sustains in\r\nAmerica. In order to form an accurate idea of the position of the\r\nPresident of the United States, it may not be irrelevant to compare it\r\nto that of one of the constitutional kings of Europe. In this\r\ncomparison I shall pay but little attention to the external signs of\r\npower, which are more apt to deceive the eye of the observer than to\r\nguide his researches. When a monarchy is being gradually transformed\r\ninto a republic, the executive power retains the titles, the honors,\r\nthe etiquette, and even the funds of royalty long after its authority\r\nhas disappeared. The English, after having cut off the head of one king\r\nand expelled another from his throne, were accustomed to accost the\r\nsuccessor of those princes upon their knees. On the other hand, when a\r\nrepublic falls under the sway of a single individual, the demeanor of\r\nthe sovereign is simple and unpretending, as if his authority was not\r\nyet paramount. When the emperors exercised an unlimited control over\r\nthe fortunes and the lives of their fellow-citizens, it was customary\r\nto call them Caesar in conversation, and they were in the habit of\r\nsupping without formality at their friends\xe2\x80\x99 houses. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to look below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe sovereignty of the United States is shared between the Union and\r\nthe States, whilst in France it is undivided and compact: hence arises\r\nthe first and the most notable difference which exists between the\r\nPresident of the United States and the King of France. In the United\r\nStates the executive power is as limited and partial as the sovereignty\r\nof the Union in whose name it acts; in France it is as universal as the\r\nauthority of the State. The Americans have a federal and the French a\r\nnational Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cause of inferiority results from the nature of things, but it is\r\nnot the only one; the second in importance is as follows: Sovereignty\r\nmay be defined to be the right of making laws: in France, the King\r\nreally exercises a portion of the sovereign power, since the laws have\r\nno weight till he has given his assent to them; he is, moreover, the\r\nexecutor of all they ordain. The President is also the executor of the\r\nlaws, but he does not really co-operate in their formation, since the\r\nrefusal of his assent does not annul them. He is therefore merely to be\r\nconsidered as the agent of the sovereign power. But not only does the\r\nKing of France exercise a portion of the sovereign power, he also\r\ncontributes to the nomination of the legislature, which exercises the\r\nother portion. He has the privilege of appointing the members of one\r\nchamber, and of dissolving the other at his pleasure; whereas the\r\nPresident of the United States has no share in the formation of the\r\nlegislative body, and cannot dissolve any part of it. The King has the\r\nsame right of bringing forward measures as the Chambers; a right which\r\nthe President does not possess. The King is represented in each\r\nassembly by his ministers, who explain his intentions, support his\r\nopinions, and maintain the principles of the Government. The President\r\nand his ministers are alike excluded from Congress; so that his\r\ninfluence and his opinions can only penetrate indirectly into that\r\ngreat body. The King of France is therefore on an equal footing with\r\nthe legislature, which can no more act without him than he can without\r\nit. The President exercises an authority inferior to, and depending\r\nupon, that of the legislature.\r\n\r\nEven in the exercise of the executive power, properly so called\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npoint upon which his position seems to be most analogous to that of the\r\nKing of France\xe2\x80\x94the President labors under several causes of\r\ninferiority. The authority of the King, in France, has, in the first\r\nplace, the advantage of duration over that of the President, and\r\ndurability is one of the chief elements of strength; nothing is either\r\nloved or feared but what is likely to endure. The President of the\r\nUnited States is a magistrate elected for four years; the King, in\r\nFrance, is an hereditary sovereign. In the exercise of the executive\r\npower the President of the United States is constantly subject to a\r\njealous scrutiny. He may make, but he cannot conclude, a treaty; he may\r\ndesignate, but he cannot appoint, a public officer. *q The King of\r\nFrance is absolute within the limits of his authority. The President of\r\nthe United States is responsible for his actions; but the person of the\r\nKing is declared inviolable by the French Charter. *r\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ The Constitution had left it doubtful whether the President was\r\nobliged to consult the Senate in the removal as well as in the\r\nappointment of Federal officers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist\xe2\x80\x9d (No. 77) seemed to\r\nestablish the affirmative; but in 1789 Congress formally decided that,\r\nas the President was responsible for his actions, he ought not to be\r\nforced to employ agents who had forfeited his esteem. See Kent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries\xe2\x80\x9d, vol. i. p. 289.]\r\n\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ [This comparison applied to the Constitutional King of France and to\r\nthe powers he held under the Charter of 1830, till the overthrow of the\r\nmonarchy in 1848.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the supremacy of public opinion is no less above the head\r\nof the one than of the other. This power is less definite, less\r\nevident, and less sanctioned by the laws in France than in America, but\r\nin fact it exists. In America, it acts by elections and decrees; in\r\nFrance it proceeds by revolutions; but notwithstanding the different\r\nconstitutions of these two countries, public opinion is the predominant\r\nauthority in both of them. The fundamental principle of legislation\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nprinciple essentially republican\xe2\x80\x94is the same in both countries,\r\nalthough its consequences may be different, and its results more or\r\nless extensive. Whence I am led to conclude that France with its King\r\nis nearer akin to a republic than the Union with its President is to a\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nIn what I have been saying I have only touched upon the main points of\r\ndistinction; and if I could have entered into details, the contrast\r\nwould have been rendered still more striking. I have remarked that the\r\nauthority of the President in the United States is only exercised\r\nwithin the limits of a partial sovereignty, whilst that of the King in\r\nFrance is undivided. I might have gone on to show that the power of the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s government in France exceeds its natural limits, however\r\nextensive they may be, and penetrates in a thousand different ways into\r\nthe administration of private interests. Amongst the examples of this\r\ninfluence may be quoted that which results from the great number of\r\npublic functionaries, who all derive their appointments from the\r\nGovernment. This number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to\r\n138,000 *s nominations, each of which may be considered as an element\r\nof power. The President of the United States has not the exclusive\r\nright of making any public appointments, and their whole number\r\nscarcely exceeds 12,000. *t\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ The sums annually paid by the State to these officers amount to\r\n200,000,000 fr.

If the\r\nexistence of the Union were perpetually threatened, and if its chief\r\ninterests were in daily connection with those of other powerful\r\nnations, the executive government would assume an increased importance\r\nin proportion to the measures expected of it, and those which it would\r\ncarry into effect. The President of the United States is the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army, but of an army composed of only six\r\nthousand men; he commands the fleet, but the fleet reckons but few\r\nsail; he conducts the foreign relations of the Union, but the United\r\nStates are a nation without neighbors. Separated from the rest of the\r\nworld by the ocean, and too weak as yet to aim at the dominion of the\r\nseas, they have no enemies, and their interests rarely come into\r\ncontact with those of any other nation of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe practical part of a Government must not be judged by the theory of\r\nits constitution. The President of the United States is in the\r\npossession of almost royal prerogatives, which he has no opportunity of\r\nexercising; and those privileges which he can at present use are very\r\ncircumscribed. The laws allow him to possess a degree of influence\r\nwhich circumstances do not permit him to employ.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the great strength of the royal prerogative in\r\nFrance arises from circumstances far more than from the laws. There the\r\nexecutive government is constantly struggling against prodigious\r\nobstacles, and exerting all its energies to repress them; so that it\r\nincreases by the extent of its achievements, and by the importance of\r\nthe events it controls, without modifying its constitution. If the laws\r\nhad made it as feeble and as circumscribed as it is in the Union, its\r\ninfluence would very soon become still more preponderant.\r\n\r\nWhy The President Of The United States Does Not Require The Majority Of\r\nThe Two Houses In Order To Carry On The Government It is an established\r\naxiom in Europe that a constitutional King cannot persevere in a system\r\nof government which is opposed by the two other branches of the\r\nlegislature. But several Presidents of the United States have been\r\nknown to lose the majority in the legislative body without being\r\nobliged to abandon the supreme power, and without inflicting a serious\r\nevil upon society. I have heard this fact quoted as an instance of the\r\nindependence and the power of the executive government in America: a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection will convince us, on the contrary, that it is a\r\nproof of its extreme weakness.\r\n\r\nA King in Europe requires the support of the legislature to enable him\r\nto perform the duties imposed upon him by the Constitution, because\r\nthose duties are enormous. A constitutional King in Europe is not\r\nmerely the executor of the law, but the execution of its provisions\r\ndevolves so completely upon him that he has the power of paralyzing its\r\ninfluence if it opposes his designs. He requires the assistance of the\r\nlegislative assemblies to make the law, but those assemblies stand in\r\nneed of his aid to execute it: these two authorities cannot subsist\r\nwithout each other, and the mechanism of government is stopped as soon\r\nas they are at variance.\r\n\r\nIn America the President cannot prevent any law from being passed, nor\r\ncan he evade the obligation of enforcing it. His sincere and zealous\r\nco-operation is no doubt useful, but it is not indispensable, in the\r\ncarrying on of public affairs. All his important acts are directly or\r\nindirectly submitted to the legislature, and of his own free authority\r\nhe can do but little. It is therefore his weakness, and not his power,\r\nwhich enables him to remain in opposition to Congress. In Europe,\r\nharmony must reign between the Crown and the other branches of the\r\nlegislature, because a collision between them may prove serious; in\r\nAmerica, this harmony is not indispensable, because such a collision is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nElection Of The President\r\n\r\nDangers of the elective system increase in proportion to the extent of\r\nthe prerogative\xe2\x80\x94This system possible in America because no powerful\r\nexecutive authority is required\xe2\x80\x94What circumstances are favorable to the\r\nelective system\xe2\x80\x94Why the election of the President does not cause a\r\ndeviation from the principles of the Government\xe2\x80\x94Influence of the\r\nelection of the President on secondary functionaries.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the system of election applied to the head of the\r\nexecutive government of a great people have been sufficiently\r\nexemplified by experience and by history, and the remarks I am about to\r\nmake refer to America alone. These dangers may be more or less\r\nformidable in proportion to the place which the executive power\r\noccupies, and to the importance it possesses in the State; and they may\r\nvary according to the mode of election and the circumstances in which\r\nthe electors are placed. The most weighty argument against the election\r\nof a chief magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a lure to private\r\nambition, and is so apt to inflame men in the pursuit of power, that\r\nwhen legitimate means are wanting force may not unfrequently seize what\r\nright denied.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the greater the privileges of the executive authority\r\nare, the greater is the temptation; the more the ambition of the\r\ncandidates is excited, the more warmly are their interests espoused by\r\na throng of partisans who hope to share the power when their patron has\r\nwon the prize. The dangers of the elective system increase, therefore,\r\nin the exact ratio of the influence exercised by the executive power in\r\nthe affairs of State. The revolutions of Poland were not solely\r\nattributable to the elective system in general, but to the fact that\r\nthe elected monarch was the sovereign of a powerful kingdom. Before we\r\ncan discuss the absolute advantages of the elective system we must make\r\npreliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the\r\nlaws, the habits, the manners, and the opinions of the people amongst\r\nwhom it is to be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak\r\nand dependent executive government; for to attempt to render the\r\nrepresentative of the State a powerful sovereign, and at the same time\r\nelective, is, in my opinion, to entertain two incompatible designs. To\r\nreduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an elective authority,\r\nthe only means that I am acquainted with are to circumscribe its sphere\r\nof action beforehand, gradually to diminish its prerogatives, and to\r\naccustom the people to live without its protection. Nothing, however,\r\nis further from the designs of the republicans of Europe than this\r\ncourse: as many of them owe their hatred of tyranny to the sufferings\r\nwhich they have personally undergone, it is oppression, and not the\r\nextent of the executive power, which excites their hostility, and they\r\nattack the former without perceiving how nearly it is connected with\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nHitherto no citizen has shown any disposition to expose his honor and\r\nhis life in order to become the President of the United States; because\r\nthe power of that office is temporary, limited, and subordinate. The\r\nprize of fortune must be great to encourage adventurers in so desperate\r\na game. No candidate has as yet been able to arouse the dangerous\r\nenthusiasm or the passionate sympathies of the people in his favor, for\r\nthe very simple reason that when he is at the head of the Government he\r\nhas but little power, but little wealth, and but little glory to share\r\namongst his friends; and his influence in the State is too small for\r\nthe success or the ruin of a faction to depend upon the elevation of an\r\nindividual to power.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of hereditary monarchies is, that as the private\r\ninterest of a family is always intimately connected with the interests\r\nof the State, the executive government is never suspended for a single\r\ninstant; and if the affairs of a monarchy are not better conducted than\r\nthose of a republic, at least there is always some one to conduct them,\r\nwell or ill, according to his capacity. In elective States, on the\r\ncontrary, the wheels of government cease to act, as it were, of their\r\nown accord at the approach of an election, and even for some time\r\nprevious to that event. The laws may indeed accelerate the operation of\r\nthe election, which may be conducted with such simplicity and rapidity\r\nthat the seat of power will never be left vacant; but, notwithstanding\r\nthese precautions, a break necessarily occurs in the minds of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of an election the head of the executive government is\r\nwholly occupied by the coming struggle; his future plans are doubtful;\r\nhe can undertake nothing new, and the he will only prosecute with\r\nindifference those designs which another will perhaps terminate. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nso near the time of my retirement from office,\xe2\x80\x9d said President\r\nJefferson on the 21st of January, 1809 (six weeks before the election),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I feel no passion, I take no part, I express no sentiment. It\r\nappears to me just to leave to my successor the commencement of those\r\nmeasures which he will have to prosecute, and for which he will be\r\nresponsible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the eyes of the nation are centred on a single\r\npoint; all are watching the gradual birth of so important an event. The\r\nwider the influence of the executive power extends, the greater and the\r\nmore necessary is its constant action, the more fatal is the term of\r\nsuspense; and a nation which is accustomed to the government, or, still\r\nmore, one used to the administrative protection of a powerful executive\r\nauthority would be infallibly convulsed by an election of this kind. In\r\nthe United States the action of the Government may be slackened with\r\nimpunity, because it is always weak and circumscribed. *u\r\n\r\nu\r\n[ [This, however, may be a great danger. The period during which Mr.\r\nBuchanan retained office, after the election of Mr. Lincoln, from\r\nNovember, 1860, to March, 1861, was that which enabled the seceding\r\nStates of the South to complete their preparations for the Civil War,\r\nand the Executive Government was paralyzed. No greater evil could\r\nbefall a nation.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the principal vices of the elective system is that it always\r\nintroduces a certain degree of instability into the internal and\r\nexternal policy of the State. But this disadvantage is less sensibly\r\nfelt if the share of power vested in the elected magistrate is small.\r\nIn Rome the principles of the Government underwent no variation,\r\nalthough the Consuls were changed every year, because the Senate, which\r\nwas an hereditary assembly, possessed the directing authority. If the\r\nelective system were adopted in Europe, the condition of most of the\r\nmonarchical States would be changed at every new election. In America\r\nthe President exercises a certain influence on State affairs, but he\r\ndoes not conduct them; the preponderating power is vested in the\r\nrepresentatives of the whole nation. The political maxims of the\r\ncountry depend therefore on the mass of the people, not on the\r\nPresident alone; and consequently in America the elective system has no\r\nvery prejudicial influence on the fixed principles of the Government.\r\nBut the want of fixed principles is an evil so inherent in the elective\r\nsystem that it is still extremely perceptible in the narrow sphere to\r\nwhich the authority of the President extends.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have admitted that the head of the executive power, who\r\nhas to bear the whole responsibility of the duties he is called upon to\r\nfulfil, ought to be empowered to choose his own agents, and to remove\r\nthem at pleasure: the legislative bodies watch the conduct of the\r\nPresident more than they direct it. The consequence of this arrangement\r\nis, that at every new election the fate of all the Federal public\r\nofficers is in suspense. Mr. Quincy Adams, on his entry into office,\r\ndischarged the majority of the individuals who had been appointed by\r\nhis predecessor: and I am not aware that General Jackson allowed a\r\nsingle removable functionary employed in the Federal service to retain\r\nhis place beyond the first year which succeeded his election. It is\r\nsometimes made a subject of complaint that in the constitutional\r\nmonarchies of Europe the fate of the humbler servants of an\r\nAdministration depends upon that of the Ministers. But in elective\r\nGovernments this evil is far greater. In a constitutional monarchy\r\nsuccessive ministries are rapidly formed; but as the principal\r\nrepresentative of the executive power does not change, the spirit of\r\ninnovation is kept within bounds; the changes which take place are in\r\nthe details rather than in the principles of the administrative system;\r\nbut to substitute one system for another, as is done in America every\r\nfour years, by law, is to cause a sort of revolution. As to the\r\nmisfortunes which may fall upon individuals in consequence of this\r\nstate of things, it must be allowed that the uncertain situation of the\r\npublic officers is less fraught with evil consequences in America than\r\nelsewhere. It is so easy to acquire an independent position in the\r\nUnited States that the public officer who loses his place may be\r\ndeprived of the comforts of life, but not of the means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nI remarked at the beginning of this chapter that the dangers of the\r\nelective system applied to the head of the State are augmented or\r\ndecreased by the peculiar circumstances of the people which adopts it.\r\nHowever the functions of the executive power may be restricted, it must\r\nalways exercise a great influence upon the foreign policy of the\r\ncountry, for a negotiation cannot be opened or successfully carried on\r\notherwise than by a single agent. The more precarious and the more\r\nperilous the position of a people becomes, the more absolute is the\r\nwant of a fixed and consistent external policy, and the more dangerous\r\ndoes the elective system of the Chief Magistrate become. The policy of\r\nthe Americans in relation to the whole world is exceedingly simple; for\r\nit may almost be said that no country stands in need of them, nor do\r\nthey require the co-operation of any other people. Their independence\r\nis never threatened. In their present condition, therefore, the\r\nfunctions of the executive power are no less limited by circumstances\r\nthan by the laws; and the President may frequently change his line of\r\npolicy without involving the State in difficulty or destruction.\r\n\r\nWhatever the prerogatives of the executive power may be, the period\r\nwhich immediately precedes an election and the moment of its duration\r\nmust always be considered as a national crisis, which is perilous in\r\nproportion to the internal embarrassments and the external dangers of\r\nthe country. Few of the nations of Europe could escape the calamities\r\nof anarchy or of conquest every time they might have to elect a new\r\nsovereign. In America society is so constituted that it can stand\r\nwithout assistance upon its own basis; nothing is to be feared from the\r\npressure of external dangers, and the election of the President is a\r\ncause of agitation, but not of ruin.\r\n\r\nMode Of Election\r\n\r\nSkill of the American legislators shown in the mode of election adopted\r\nby them\xe2\x80\x94Creation of a special electoral body\xe2\x80\x94Separate votes of these\r\nelectors\xe2\x80\x94Case in which the House of Representatives is called upon to\r\nchoose the President\xe2\x80\x94Results of the twelve elections which have taken\r\nplace since the Constitution has been established.\r\n\r\nBesides the dangers which are inherent in the system, many other\r\ndifficulties may arise from the mode of election, which may be obviated\r\nby the precaution of the legislator. When a people met in arms on some\r\npublic spot to choose its head, it was exposed to all the chances of\r\ncivil war resulting from so martial a mode of proceeding, besides the\r\ndangers of the elective system in itself. The Polish laws, which\r\nsubjected the election of the sovereign to the veto of a single\r\nindividual, suggested the murder of that individual or prepared the way\r\nto anarchy.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the institutions and the political as well as\r\nsocial condition of the United States, we are struck by the admirable\r\nharmony of the gifts of fortune and the efforts of man. The nation\r\npossessed two of the main causes of internal peace; it was a new\r\ncountry, but it was inhabited by a people grown old in the exercise of\r\nfreedom. America had no hostile neighbors to dread; and the American\r\nlegislators, profiting by these favorable circumstances, created a weak\r\nand subordinate executive power which could without danger be made\r\nelective.\r\n\r\nIt then only remained for them to choose the least dangerous of the\r\nvarious modes of election; and the rules which they laid down upon this\r\npoint admirably correspond to the securities which the physical and\r\npolitical constitution of the country already afforded. Their object\r\nwas to find the mode of election which would best express the choice of\r\nthe people with the least possible excitement and suspense. It was\r\nadmitted in the first place that the simple majority should be\r\ndecisive; but the difficulty was to obtain this majority without an\r\ninterval of delay which it was most important to avoid. It rarely\r\nhappens that an individual can at once collect the majority of the\r\nsuffrages of a great people; and this difficulty is enhanced in a\r\nrepublic of confederate States, where local influences are apt to\r\npreponderate. The means by which it was proposed to obviate this second\r\nobstacle was to delegate the electoral powers of the nation to a body\r\nof representatives. This mode of election rendered a majority more\r\nprobable; for the fewer the electors are, the greater is the chance of\r\ntheir coming to a final decision. It also offered an additional\r\nprobability of a judicious choice. It then remained to be decided\r\nwhether this right of election was to be entrusted to a legislative\r\nbody, the habitual representative assembly of the nation, or whether an\r\nelectoral assembly should be formed for the express purpose of\r\nproceeding to the nomination of a President. The Americans chose the\r\nlatter alternative, from a belief that the individuals who were\r\nreturned to make the laws were incompetent to represent the wishes of\r\nthe nation in the election of its chief magistrate; and that, as they\r\nare chosen for more than a year, the constituency they represent might\r\nhave changed its opinion in that time. It was thought that if the\r\nlegislature was empowered to elect the head of the executive power, its\r\nmembers would, for some time before the election, be exposed to the\r\nmanoeuvres of corruption and the tricks of intrigue; whereas the\r\nspecial electors would, like a jury, remain mixed up with the crowd\r\ntill the day of action, when they would appear for the sole purpose of\r\ngiving their votes.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore established that every State should name a certain\r\nnumber of electors, *v who in their turn should elect the President;\r\nand as it had been observed that the assemblies to which the choice of\r\na chief magistrate had been entrusted in elective countries inevitably\r\nbecame the centres of passion and of cabal; that they sometimes usurped\r\nan authority which did not belong to them; and that their proceedings,\r\nor the uncertainty which resulted from them, were sometimes prolonged\r\nso much as to endanger the welfare of the State, it was determined that\r\nthe electors should all vote upon the same day, without being convoked\r\nto the same place. *w This double election rendered a majority\r\nprobable, though not certain; for it was possible that as many\r\ndifferences might exist between the electors as between their\r\nconstituents. In this case it was necessary to have recourse to one of\r\nthree measures; either to appoint new electors, or to consult a second\r\ntime those already appointed, or to defer the election to another\r\nauthority. The first two of these alternatives, independently of the\r\nuncertainty of their results, were likely to delay the final decision,\r\nand to perpetuate an agitation which must always be accompanied with\r\ndanger. The third expedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed\r\nthat the votes should be transmitted sealed to the President of the\r\nSenate, and that they should be opened and counted in the presence of\r\nthe Senate and the House of Representatives. If none of the candidates\r\nhas a majority, the House of Representatives then proceeds immediately\r\nto elect a President, but with the condition that it must fix upon one\r\nof the three candidates who have the highest numbers. *x\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ As many as it sends members to Congress. The number of electors at\r\nthe election of 1833 was 288. (See \xe2\x80\x9cThe National Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d 1833.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nw\r\n[ The electors of the same State assemble, but they transmit to the\r\ncentral government the list of their individual votes, and not the mere\r\nresult of the vote of the majority.] [Footnote x: In this case it is\r\nthe majority of the States, and not the majority of the members, which\r\ndecides the question; so that New York has not more influence in the\r\ndebate than Rhode Island. Thus the citizens of the Union are first\r\nconsulted as members of one and the same community; and, if they cannot\r\nagree, recourse is had to the division of the States, each of which has\r\na separate and independent vote. This is one of the singularities of\r\nthe Federal Constitution which can only be explained by the jar of\r\nconflicting interests.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it is only in case of an event which cannot often happen, and\r\nwhich can never be foreseen, that the election is entrusted to the\r\nordinary representatives of the nation; and even then they are obliged\r\nto choose a citizen who has already been designated by a powerful\r\nminority of the special electors. It is by this happy expedient that\r\nthe respect which is due to the popular voice is combined with the\r\nutmost celerity of execution and those precautions which the peace of\r\nthe country demands. But the decision of the question by the House of\r\nRepresentatives does not necessarily offer an immediate solution of the\r\ndifficulty, for the majority of that assembly may still be doubtful,\r\nand in this case the Constitution prescribes no remedy. Nevertheless,\r\nby restricting the number of candidates to three, and by referring the\r\nmatter to the judgment of an enlightened public body, it has smoothed\r\nall the obstacles *y which are not inherent in the elective system.\r\n\r\ny\r\n[ Jefferson, in 1801, was not elected until the thirty-sixth time of\r\nballoting.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the forty-four years which have elapsed since the promulgation of\r\nthe Federal Constitution the United States have twelve times chosen a\r\nPresident. Ten of these elections took place simultaneously by the\r\nvotes of the special electors in the different States. The House of\r\nRepresentatives has only twice exercised its conditional privilege of\r\ndeciding in cases of uncertainty; the first time was at the election of\r\nMr. Jefferson in 1801; the second was in 1825, when Mr. Quincy Adams\r\nwas named. *z\r\n\r\nz\r\n[ [General Grant is now (1874) the eighteenth President of the United\r\nStates.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nCrises Of The Election\r\n\r\nThe Election may be considered as a national crisis\xe2\x80\x94Why?\xe2\x80\x94Passions of\r\nthe people\xe2\x80\x94Anxiety of the President\xe2\x80\x94Calm which succeeds the agitation\r\nof the election.\r\n\r\nI have shown what the circumstances are which favored the adoption of\r\nthe elective system in the United States, and what precautions were\r\ntaken by the legislators to obviate its dangers. The Americans are\r\nhabitually accustomed to all kinds of elections, and they know by\r\nexperience the utmost degree of excitement which is compatible with\r\nsecurity. The vast extent of the country and the dissemination of the\r\ninhabitants render a collision between parties less probable and less\r\ndangerous there than elsewhere. The political circumstances under which\r\nthe elections have hitherto been carried on have presented no real\r\nembarrassments to the nation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the epoch of the election of a President of the United\r\nStates may be considered as a crisis in the affairs of the nation. The\r\ninfluence which he exercises on public business is no doubt feeble and\r\nindirect; but the choice of the President, which is of small importance\r\nto each individual citizen, concerns the citizens collectively; and\r\nhowever trifling an interest may be, it assumes a great degree of\r\nimportance as soon as it becomes general. The President possesses but\r\nfew means of rewarding his supporters in comparison to the kings of\r\nEurope, but the places which are at his disposal are sufficiently\r\nnumerous to interest, directly or indirectly, several thousand electors\r\nin his success. Political parties in the United States are led to rally\r\nround an individual, in order to acquire a more tangible shape in the\r\neyes of the crowd, and the name of the candidate for the Presidency is\r\nput forward as the symbol and personification of their theories. For\r\nthese reasons parties are strongly interested in gaining the election,\r\nnot so much with a view to the triumph of their principles under the\r\nauspices of the President-elect as to show by the majority which\r\nreturned him, the strength of the supporters of those principles.\r\n\r\nFor a long while before the appointed time is at hand the election\r\nbecomes the most important and the all-engrossing topic of discussion.\r\nThe ardor of faction is redoubled; and all the artificial passions\r\nwhich the imagination can create in the bosom of a happy and peaceful\r\nland are agitated and brought to light. The President, on the other\r\nhand, is absorbed by the cares of self-defence. He no longer governs\r\nfor the interest of the State, but for that of his re-election; he does\r\nhomage to the majority, and instead of checking its passions, as his\r\nduty commands him to do, he frequently courts its worst caprices. As\r\nthe election draws near, the activity of intrigue and the agitation of\r\nthe populace increase; the citizens are divided into hostile camps,\r\neach of which assumes the name of its favorite candidate; the whole\r\nnation glows with feverish excitement; the election is the daily theme\r\nof the public papers, the subject of private conversation, the end of\r\nevery thought and every action, the sole interest of the present. As\r\nsoon as the choice is determined, this ardor is dispelled; and as a\r\ncalmer season returns, the current of the State, which had nearly\r\nbroken its banks, sinks to its usual level: *a but who can refrain from\r\nastonishment at the causes of the storm.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ [Not always.

It seems at\r\nfirst sight contrary to all reason to prevent the head of the executive\r\npower from being elected a second time. The influence which the talents\r\nand the character of a single individual may exercise upon the fate of\r\na whole people, in critical circumstances or arduous times, is well\r\nknown: a law preventing the re-election of the chief magistrate would\r\ndeprive the citizens of the surest pledge of the prosperity and the\r\nsecurity of the commonwealth; and, by a singular inconsistency, a man\r\nwould be excluded from the government at the very time when he had\r\nshown his ability in conducting its affairs.\r\n\r\nBut if these arguments are strong, perhaps still more powerful reasons\r\nmay be advanced against them. Intrigue and corruption are the natural\r\ndefects of elective government; but when the head of the State can be\r\nre-elected these evils rise to a great height, and compromise the very\r\nexistence of the country. When a simple candidate seeks to rise by\r\nintrigue, his manoeuvres must necessarily be limited to a narrow\r\nsphere; but when the chief magistrate enters the lists, he borrows the\r\nstrength of the government for his own purposes. In the former case the\r\nfeeble resources of an individual are in action; in the latter, the\r\nState itself, with all its immense influence, is busied in the work of\r\ncorruption and cabal. The private citizen, who employs the most immoral\r\npractices to acquire power, can only act in a manner indirectly\r\nprejudicial to the public prosperity. But if the representative of the\r\nexecutive descends into the combat, the cares of government dwindle\r\ninto second-rate importance, and the success of his election is his\r\nfirst concern. All laws and all the negotiations he undertakes are to\r\nhim nothing more than electioneering schemes; places become the reward\r\nof services rendered, not to the nation, but to its chief; and the\r\ninfluence of the government, if not injurious to the country, is at\r\nleast no longer beneficial to the community for which it was created.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the\r\nUnited States without perceiving that the desire of being re-elected is\r\nthe chief aim of the President; that his whole administration, and even\r\nhis most indifferent measures, tend to this object; and that, as the\r\ncrisis approaches, his personal interest takes the place of his\r\ninterest in the public good. The principle of re-eligibility renders\r\nthe corrupt influence of elective government still more extensive and\r\npernicious.\r\n\r\nIn America it exercises a peculiarly fatal influence on the sources of\r\nnational existence. Every government seems to be afflicted by some evil\r\nwhich is inherent in its nature, and the genius of the legislator is\r\nshown in eluding its attacks. A State may survive the influence of a\r\nhost of bad laws, and the mischief they cause is frequently\r\nexaggerated; but a law which encourages the growth of the canker within\r\nmust prove fatal in the end, although its bad consequences may not be\r\nimmediately perceived.\r\n\r\nThe principle of destruction in absolute monarchies lies in the\r\nexcessive and unreasonable extension of the prerogative of the crown;\r\nand a measure tending to remove the constitutional provisions which\r\ncounterbalance this influence would be radically bad, even if its\r\nimmediate consequences were unattended with evil. By a parity of\r\nreasoning, in countries governed by a democracy, where the people is\r\nperpetually drawing all authority to itself, the laws which increase or\r\naccelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very principle\r\nof the government.\r\n\r\nThe greatest proof of the ability of the American legislators is, that\r\nthey clearly discerned this truth, and that they had the courage to act\r\nup to it. They conceived that a certain authority above the body of the\r\npeople was necessary, which should enjoy a degree of independence,\r\nwithout, however, being entirely beyond the popular control; an\r\nauthority which would be forced to comply with the permanent\r\ndeterminations of the majority, but which would be able to resist its\r\ncaprices, and to refuse its most dangerous demands. To this end they\r\ncentred the whole executive power of the nation in a single arm; they\r\ngranted extensive prerogatives to the President, and they armed him\r\nwith the veto to resist the encroachments of the legislature.\r\n\r\nBut by introducing the principle of re-election they partly destroyed\r\ntheir work; and they rendered the President but little inclined to\r\nexert the great power they had vested in his hands. If ineligible a\r\nsecond time, the President would be far from independent of the people,\r\nfor his responsibility would not be lessened; but the favor of the\r\npeople would not be so necessary to him as to induce him to court it by\r\nhumoring its desires. If re-eligible (and this is more especially true\r\nat the present day, when political morality is relaxed, and when great\r\nmen are rare), the President of the United States becomes an easy tool\r\nin the hands of the majority. He adopts its likings and its\r\nanimosities, he hastens to anticipate its wishes, he forestalls its\r\ncomplaints, he yields to its idlest cravings, and instead of guiding\r\nit, as the legislature intended that he should do, he is ever ready to\r\nfollow its bidding. Thus, in order not to deprive the State of the\r\ntalents of an individual, those talents have been rendered almost\r\nuseless; and to reserve an expedient for extraordinary perils, the\r\ncountry has been exposed to daily dangers.\r\n\r\nFederal Courts *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ See chap.

Their judicial institutions\r\nexercise a great influence on the condition of the Anglo-Americans, and\r\nthey occupy a prominent place amongst what are probably called\r\npolitical institutions: in this respect they are peculiarly deserving\r\nof our attention. But I am at a loss to explain the political action of\r\nthe American tribunals without entering into some technical details of\r\ntheir constitution and their forms of proceeding; and I know not how to\r\ndescend to these minutiae without wearying the curiosity of the reader\r\nby the natural aridity of the subject, or without risking to fall into\r\nobscurity through a desire to be succinct. I can scarcely hope to\r\nescape these various evils; for if I appear too lengthy to a man of the\r\nworld, a lawyer may on the other hand complain of my brevity. But these\r\nare the natural disadvantages of my subject, and more especially of the\r\npoint which I am about to discuss.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty was, not to devise the Constitution to the Federal\r\nGovernment, but to find out a method of enforcing its laws. Governments\r\nhave in general but two means of overcoming the opposition of the\r\npeople they govern, viz., the physical force which is at their own\r\ndisposal, and the moral force which they derive from the decisions of\r\nthe courts of justice.\r\n\r\nA government which should have no other means of exacting obedience\r\nthan open war must be very near its ruin, for one of two alternatives\r\nwould then probably occur: if its authority was small and its character\r\ntemperate, it would not resort to violence till the last extremity, and\r\nit would connive at a number of partial acts of insubordination, in\r\nwhich case the State would gradually fall into anarchy; if it was\r\nenterprising and powerful, it would perpetually have recourse to its\r\nphysical strength, and would speedily degenerate into a military\r\ndespotism. So that its activity would not be less prejudicial to the\r\ncommunity than its inaction.\r\n\r\nThe great end of justice is to substitute the notion of right for that\r\nof violence, and to place a legal barrier between the power of the\r\ngovernment and the use of physical force. The authority which is\r\nawarded to the intervention of a court of justice by the general\r\nopinion of mankind is so surprisingly great that it clings to the mere\r\nformalities of justice, and gives a bodily influence to the shadow of\r\nthe law. The moral force which courts of justice possess renders the\r\nintroduction of physical force exceedingly rare, and is very frequently\r\nsubstituted for it; but if the latter proves to be indispensable, its\r\npower is doubled by the association of the idea of law.\r\n\r\nA federal government stands in greater need of the support of judicial\r\ninstitutions than any other, because it is naturally weak and exposed\r\nto formidable opposition. *c If it were always obliged to resort to\r\nviolence in the first instance, it could not fulfil its task. The\r\nUnion, therefore, required a national judiciary to enforce the\r\nobedience of the citizens to the laws, and to repeal the attacks which\r\nmight be directed against them. The question then remained as to what\r\ntribunals were to exercise these privileges; were they to be entrusted\r\nto the courts of justice which were already organized in every State?\r\nor was it necessary to create federal courts? It may easily be proved\r\nthat the Union could not adapt the judicial power of the States to its\r\nwants. The separation of the judiciary from the administrative power of\r\nthe State no doubt affects the security of every citizen and the\r\nliberty of all. But it is no less important to the existence of the\r\nnation that these several powers should have the same origin, should\r\nfollow the same principles, and act in the same sphere; in a word, that\r\nthey should be correlative and homogeneous. No one, I presume, ever\r\nsuggested the advantage of trying offences committed in France by a\r\nforeign court of justice, in order to secure the impartiality of the\r\njudges. The Americans form one people in relation to their Federal\r\nGovernment; but in the bosom of this people divers political bodies\r\nhave been allowed to subsist which are dependent on the national\r\nGovernment in a few points, and independent in all the rest; which have\r\nall a distinct origin, maxims peculiar to themselves, and special means\r\nof carrying on their affairs. To entrust the execution of the laws of\r\nthe Union to tribunals instituted by these political bodies would be to\r\nallow foreign judges to preside over the nation. Nay, more; not only is\r\neach State foreign to the Union at large, but it is in perpetual\r\nopposition to the common interests, since whatever authority the Union\r\nloses turns to the advantage of the States. Thus to enforce the laws of\r\nthe Union by means of the tribunals of the States would be to allow not\r\nonly foreign but partial judges to preside over the nation.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ Federal laws are those which most require courts of justice, and\r\nthose at the same time which have most rarely established them. The\r\nreason is that confederations have usually been formed by independent\r\nStates, which entertained no real intention of obeying the central\r\nGovernment, and which very readily ceded the right of command to the\r\nfederal executive, and very prudently reserved the right of\r\nnon-compliance to themselves.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the number, still more than the mere character, of the tribunals of\r\nthe States rendered them unfit for the service of the nation. When the\r\nFederal Constitution was formed there were already thirteen courts of\r\njustice in the United States which decided causes without appeal. That\r\nnumber is now increased to twenty-four. To suppose that a State can\r\nsubsist when its fundamental laws may be subjected to four-and-twenty\r\ndifferent interpretations at the same time is to advance a proposition\r\nalike contrary to reason and to experience.\r\n\r\nThe American legislators therefore agreed to create a federal judiciary\r\npower to apply the laws of the Union, and to determine certain\r\nquestions affecting general interests, which were carefully determined\r\nbeforehand. The entire judicial power of the Union was centred in one\r\ntribunal, which was denominated the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nBut, to facilitate the expedition of business, inferior courts were\r\nappended to it, which were empowered to decide causes of small\r\nimportance without appeal, and with appeal causes of more magnitude.\r\nThe members of the Supreme Court are named neither by the people nor\r\nthe legislature, but by the President of the United States, acting with\r\nthe advice of the Senate. In order to render them independent of the\r\nother authorities, their office was made inalienable; and it was\r\ndetermined that their salary, when once fixed, should not be altered by\r\nthe legislature. *d It was easy to proclaim the principle of a Federal\r\njudiciary, but difficulties multiplied when the extent of its\r\njurisdiction was to be determined.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ The Union was divided into districts, in each of which a resident\r\nFederal judge was appointed, and the court in which he presided was\r\ntermed a \xe2\x80\x9cDistrict Court.\xe2\x80\x9d Each of the judges of the Supreme Court\r\nannually visits a certain portion of the Republic, in order to try the\r\nmost important causes upon the spot; the court presided over by this\r\nmagistrate is styled a \xe2\x80\x9cCircuit Court.\xe2\x80\x9d Lastly, all the most serious\r\ncases of litigation are brought before the Supreme Court, which holds a\r\nsolemn session once a year, at which all the judges of the Circuit\r\nCourts must attend. The jury was introduced into the Federal Courts in\r\nthe same manner, and in the same cases, as into the courts of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that no analogy exists between the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States and the French Cour de Cassation, since the latter\r\nonly hears appeals on questions of law. The Supreme Court decides upon\r\nthe evidence of the fact as well as upon the law of the case, whereas\r\nthe Cour de Cassation does not pronounce a decision of its own, but\r\nrefers the cause to the arbitration of another tribunal. See the law of\r\nSeptember 24, 1789, \xe2\x80\x9cLaws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d by Story, vol. i. p.\r\n53.]\r\n\r\nMeans Of Determining The Jurisdiction Of The Federal Courts Difficulty\r\nof determining the jurisdiction of separate courts of justice in\r\nconfederations\xe2\x80\x94The courts of the Union obtained the right of fixing\r\ntheir own jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94In what respect this rule attacks the portion of\r\nsovereignty reserved to the several States\xe2\x80\x94The sovereignty of these\r\nStates restricted by the laws, and the interpretation of the\r\nlaws\xe2\x80\x94Consequently, the danger of the several States is more apparent\r\nthan real.\r\n\r\nAs the Constitution of the United States recognized two distinct powers\r\nin presence of each other, represented in a judicial point of view by\r\ntwo distinct classes of courts of justice, the utmost care which could\r\nbe taken in defining their separate jurisdictions would have been\r\ninsufficient to prevent frequent collisions between those tribunals.\r\nThe question then arose to whom the right of deciding the competency of\r\neach court was to be referred.\r\n\r\nIn nations which constitute a single body politic, when a question is\r\ndebated between two courts relating to their mutual jurisdiction, a\r\nthird tribunal is generally within reach to decide the difference; and\r\nthis is effected without difficulty, because in these nations the\r\nquestions of judicial competency have no connection with the privileges\r\nof the national supremacy. But it was impossible to create an arbiter\r\nbetween a superior court of the Union and the superior court of a\r\nseparate State which would not belong to one of these two classes. It\r\nwas, therefore, necessary to allow one of these courts to judge its own\r\ncause, and to take or to retain cognizance of the point which was\r\ncontested. To grant this privilege to the different courts of the\r\nStates would have been to destroy the sovereignty of the Union de facto\r\nafter having established it de jure; for the interpretation of the\r\nConstitution would soon have restored that portion of independence to\r\nthe States of which the terms of that act deprived them. The object of\r\nthe creation of a Federal tribunal was to prevent the courts of the\r\nStates from deciding questions affecting the national interests in\r\ntheir own department, and so to form a uniform body of jurisprudene for\r\nthe interpretation of the laws of the Union. This end would not have\r\nbeen accomplished if the courts of the several States had been\r\ncompetent to decide upon cases in their separate capacities from which\r\nthey were obliged to abstain as Federal tribunals. The Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States was therefore invested with the right of determining\r\nall questions of jurisdiction. *e\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ In order to diminish the number of these suits, it was decided that\r\nin a great many Federal causes the courts of the States should be\r\nempowered to decide conjointly with those of the Union, the losing\r\nparty having then a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates. The Supreme Court of Virginia contested the right of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States to judge an appeal from its\r\ndecisions, but unsuccessfully. See \xe2\x80\x9cKent\xe2\x80\x99s Commentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p.\r\n300, pp. 370 et seq.; Story\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 646; and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Organic\r\nLaw of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 35.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a severe blow upon the independence of the States, which was\r\nthus restricted not only by the laws, but by the interpretation of\r\nthem; by one limit which was known, and by another which was dubious;\r\nby a rule which was certain, and a rule which was arbitrary. It is true\r\nthe Constitution had laid down the precise limits of the Federal\r\nsupremacy, but whenever this supremacy is contested by one of the\r\nStates, a Federal tribunal decides the question. Nevertheless, the\r\ndangers with which the independence of the States was threatened by\r\nthis mode of proceeding are less serious than they appeared to be. We\r\nshall see hereafter that in America the real strength of the country is\r\nvested in the provincial far more than in the Federal Government. The\r\nFederal judges are conscious of the relative weakness of the power in\r\nwhose name they act, and they are more inclined to abandon a right of\r\njurisdiction in cases where it is justly their own than to assert a\r\nprivilege to which they have no legal claim.\r\n\r\nDifferent Cases Of Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nThe matter and the party are the first conditions of the Federal\r\njurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94Suits in which ambassadors are engaged\xe2\x80\x94Suits of the\r\nUnion\xe2\x80\x94Of a separate State\xe2\x80\x94By whom tried\xe2\x80\x94Causes resulting from the laws\r\nof the Union\xe2\x80\x94Why judged by the Federal tribunals\xe2\x80\x94Causes relating to the\r\nperformance of contracts tried by the Federal courts\xe2\x80\x94Consequence of\r\nthis arrangement.\r\n\r\nAfter having appointed the means of fixing the competency of the\r\nFederal courts, the legislators of the Union defined the cases which\r\nshould come within their jurisdiction. It was established, on the one\r\nhand, that certain parties must always be brought before the Federal\r\ncourts, without any regard to the special nature of the cause; and, on\r\nthe other, that certain causes must always be brought before the same\r\ncourts, without any regard to the quality of the parties in the suit.\r\nThese distinctions were therefore admitted to be the basis of the\r\nFederal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors are the representatives of nations in a state of amity with\r\nthe Union, and whatever concerns these personages concerns in some\r\ndegree the whole Union. When an ambassador is a party in a suit, that\r\nsuit affects the welfare of the nation, and a Federal tribunal is\r\nnaturally called upon to decide it.\r\n\r\nThe Union itself may be invoked in legal proceedings, and in this case\r\nit would be alike contrary to the customs of all nations and to common\r\nsense to appeal to a tribunal representing any other sovereignty than\r\nits own; the Federal courts, therefore, take cognizance of these\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nWhen two parties belonging to two different States are engaged in a\r\nsuit, the case cannot with propriety be brought before a court of\r\neither State. The surest expedient is to select a tribunal like that of\r\nthe Union, which can excite the suspicions of neither party, and which\r\noffers the most natural as well as the most certain remedy.\r\n\r\nWhen the two parties are not private individuals, but States, an\r\nimportant political consideration is added to the same motive of\r\nequity. The quality of the parties in this case gives a national\r\nimportance to all their disputes; and the most trifling litigation of\r\nthe States may be said to involve the peace of the whole Union. *f\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ The Constitution also says that the Federal courts shall decide\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontroversies between a State and the citizens of another State.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhere a most important question of a constitutional nature arose, which\r\nwas, whether the jurisdiction given by the Constitution in cases in\r\nwhich a State is a party extended to suits brought against a State as\r\nwell as by it, or was exclusively confined to the latter. The question\r\nwas most elaborately considered in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, and\r\nwas decided by the majority of the Supreme Court in the affirmative.\r\nThe decision created general alarm among the States, and an amendment\r\nwas proposed and ratified by which the power was entirely taken away,\r\nso far as it regards suits brought against a State. See Story\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 624, or in the large edition Section 1677.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the cause frequently prescribes the rule of competency.\r\nThus all the questions which concern maritime commerce evidently fall\r\nunder the cognizance of the Federal tribunals. *g Almost all these\r\nquestions are connected with the interpretation of the law of nations,\r\nand in this respect they essentially interest the Union in relation to\r\nforeign powers. Moreover, as the sea is not included within the limits\r\nof any peculiar jurisdiction, the national courts can only hear causes\r\nwhich originate in maritime affairs.\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ As for instance, all cases of piracy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution comprises under one head almost all the cases which by\r\ntheir very nature come within the limits of the Federal courts. The\r\nrule which it lays down is simple, but pregnant with an entire system\r\nof ideas, and with a vast multitude of facts. It declares that the\r\njudicial power of the Supreme Court shall extend to all cases in law\r\nand equity arising under the laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nTwo examples will put the intention of the legislator in the clearest\r\nlight:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution prohibits the States from making laws on the value and\r\ncirculation of money: If, notwithstanding this prohibition, a State\r\npasses a law of this kind, with which the interested parties refuse to\r\ncomply because it is contrary to the Constitution, the case must come\r\nbefore a Federal court, because it arises under the laws of the United\r\nStates. Again, if difficulties arise in the levying of import duties\r\nwhich have been voted by Congress, the Federal court must decide the\r\ncase, because it arises under the interpretation of a law of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis rule is in perfect accordance with the fundamental principles of\r\nthe Federal Constitution. The Union, as it was established in 1789,\r\npossesses, it is true, a limited supremacy; but it was intended that\r\nwithin its limits it should form one and the same people. *h Within\r\nthose limits the Union is sovereign. When this point is established and\r\nadmitted, the inference is easy; for if it be acknowledged that the\r\nUnited States constitute one and the same people within the bounds\r\nprescribed by their Constitution, it is impossible to refuse them the\r\nrights which belong to other nations. But it has been allowed, from the\r\norigin of society, that every nation has the right of deciding by its\r\nown courts those questions which concern the execution of its own laws.\r\nTo this it is answered that the Union is in so singular a position that\r\nin relation to some matters it constitutes a people, and that in\r\nrelation to all the rest it is a nonentity. But the inference to be\r\ndrawn is, that in the laws relating to these matters the Union\r\npossesses all the rights of absolute sovereignty. The difficulty is to\r\nknow what these matters are; and when once it is resolved (and we have\r\nshown how it was resolved, in speaking of the means of determining the\r\njurisdiction of the Federal courts) no further doubt can arise; for as\r\nsoon as it is established that a suit is Federal\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, that\r\nit belongs to the share of sovereignty reserved by the Constitution of\r\nthe Union\xe2\x80\x94the natural consequence is that it should come within the\r\njurisdiction of a Federal court.\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ This principle was in some measure restricted by the introduction of\r\nthe several States as independent powers into the Senate, and by\r\nallowing them to vote separately in the House of Representatives when\r\nthe President is elected by that body. But these are exceptions, and\r\nthe contrary principle is the rule.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the laws of the United States are attacked, or whenever they\r\nare resorted to in self-defence, the Federal courts must be appealed\r\nto. Thus the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the Union extends and\r\nnarrows its limits exactly in the same ratio as the sovereignty of the\r\nUnion augments or decreases. We have shown that the principal aim of\r\nthe legislators of 1789 was to divide the sovereign authority into two\r\nparts. In the one they placed the control of all the general interests\r\nof the Union, in the other the control of the special interests of its\r\ncomponent States. Their chief solicitude was to arm the Federal\r\nGovernment with sufficient power to enable it to resist, within its\r\nsphere, the encroachments of the several States. As for these\r\ncommunities, the principle of independence within certain limits of\r\ntheir own was adopted in their behalf; and they were concealed from the\r\ninspection, and protected from the control, of the central Government.\r\nIn speaking of the division of authority, I observed that this latter\r\nprinciple had not always been held sacred, since the States are\r\nprevented from passing certain laws which apparently belong to their\r\nown particular sphere of interest. When a State of the Union passes a\r\nlaw of this kind, the citizens who are injured by its execution can\r\nappeal to the Federal courts.\r\n\r\nThus the jurisdiction of the Federal courts extends not only to all the\r\ncases which arise under the laws of the Union, but also to those which\r\narise under laws made by the several States in opposition to the\r\nConstitution. The States are prohibited from making ex post facto laws\r\nin criminal cases, and any person condemned by virtue of a law of this\r\nkind can appeal to the judicial power of the Union. The States are\r\nlikewise prohibited from making laws which may have a tendency to\r\nimpair the obligations of contracts. *i If a citizen thinks that an\r\nobligation of this kind is impaired by a law passed in his State, he\r\nmay refuse to obey it, and may appeal to the Federal courts. *j\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ It is perfectly clear, says Mr. Story (\xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 503, or in\r\nthe large edition Section 1379), that any law which enlarges, abridges,\r\nor in any manner changes the intention of the parties, resulting from\r\nthe stipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it. He gives in\r\nthe same place a very long and careful definition of what is understood\r\nby a contract in Federal jurisprudence. A grant made by the State to a\r\nprivate individual, and accepted by him, is a contract, and cannot be\r\nrevoked by any future law. A charter granted by the State to a company\r\nis a contract, and equally binding to the State as to the grantee. The\r\nclause of the Constitution here referred to insures, therefore, the\r\nexistence of a great part of acquired rights, but not of all. Property\r\nmay legally be held, though it may not have passed into the possessor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands by means of a contract; and its possession is an acquired right,\r\nnot guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ A remarkable instance of this is given by Mr. Story (p. 508, or in\r\nthe large edition Section 1388): \xe2\x80\x9cDartmouth College in New Hampshire\r\nhad been founded by a charter granted to certain individuals before the\r\nAmerican Revolution, and its trustees formed a corporation under this\r\ncharter. The legislature of New Hampshire had, without the consent of\r\nthis corporation, passed an act changing the organization of the\r\noriginal provincial charter of the college, and transferring all the\r\nrights, privileges, and franchises from the old charter trustees to new\r\ntrustees appointed under the act. The constitutionality of the act was\r\ncontested, and, after solemn arguments, it was deliberately held by the\r\nSupreme Court that the provincial charter was a contract within the\r\nmeaning of the Constitution (Art. I. Section 10), and that the\r\nemendatory act was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of that\r\ncharter. The college was deemed, like other colleges of private\r\nfoundation, to be a private eleemosynary institution, endowed by its\r\ncharter with a capacity to take property unconnected with the\r\nGovernment. Its funds were bestowed upon the faith of the charter, and\r\nthose funds consisted entirely of private donations. It is true that\r\nthe uses were in some sense public, that is, for the general benefit,\r\nand not for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did not make\r\nthe corporation a public corporation. It was a private institution for\r\ngeneral charity. It was not distinguishable in principle from a private\r\ndonation, vested in private trustees, for a public charity, or for a\r\nparticular purpose of beneficence. And the State itself, if it had\r\nbestowed funds upon a charity of the same nature, could not resume\r\nthose funds.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis provision appears to me to be the most serious attack upon the\r\nindependence of the States. The rights awarded to the Federal\r\nGovernment for purposes of obvious national importance are definite and\r\neasily comprehensible; but those with which this last clause invests it\r\nare not either clearly appreciable or accurately defined. For there are\r\nvast numbers of political laws which influence the existence of\r\nobligations of contracts, which may thus furnish an easy pretext for\r\nthe aggressions of the central authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x94Part IV\r\n\r\nProcedure Of The Federal Courts\r\n\r\nNatural weakness of the judiciary power in confederations\xe2\x80\x94Legislators\r\nought to strive as much as possible to bring private individuals, and\r\nnot States, before the Federal Courts\xe2\x80\x94How the Americans have succeeded\r\nin this\xe2\x80\x94Direct prosecution of private individuals in the Federal\r\nCourts\xe2\x80\x94Indirect prosecution of the States which violate the laws of the\r\nUnion\xe2\x80\x94The decrees of the Supreme Court enervate but do not destroy the\r\nprovincial laws.\r\n\r\nI have shown what the privileges of the Federal courts are, and it is\r\nno less important to point out the manner in which they are exercised.\r\nThe irresistible authority of justice in countries in which the\r\nsovereignty in undivided is derived from the fact that the tribunals of\r\nthose countries represent the entire nation at issue with the\r\nindividual against whom their decree is directed, and the idea of power\r\nis thus introduced to corroborate the idea of right. But this is not\r\nalways the case in countries in which the sovereignty is divided; in\r\nthem the judicial power is more frequently opposed to a fraction of the\r\nnation than to an isolated individual, and its moral authority and\r\nphysical strength are consequently diminished. In federal States the\r\npower of the judge is naturally decreased, and that of the justiciable\r\nparties is augmented. The aim of the legislator in confederate States\r\nought therefore to be to render the position of the courts of justice\r\nanalogous to that which they occupy in countries where the sovereignty\r\nis undivided; in other words, his efforts ought constantly to tend to\r\nmaintain the judicial power of the confederation as the representative\r\nof the nation, and the justiciable party as the representative of an\r\nindividual interest.\r\n\r\nEvery government, whatever may be its constitution, requires the means\r\nof constraining its subjects to discharge their obligations, and of\r\nprotecting its privileges from their assaults. As far as the direct\r\naction of the Government on the community is concerned, the\r\nConstitution of the United States contrived, by a master-stroke of\r\npolicy, that the federal courts, acting in the name of the laws, should\r\nonly take cognizance of parties in an individual capacity. For, as it\r\nhad been declared that the Union consisted of one and the same people\r\nwithin the limits laid down by the Constitution, the inference was that\r\nthe Government created by this Constitution, and acting within these\r\nlimits, was invested with all the privileges of a national government,\r\none of the principal of which is the right of transmitting its\r\ninjunctions directly to the private citizen. When, for instance, the\r\nUnion votes an impost, it does not apply to the States for the levying\r\nof it, but to every American citizen in proportion to his assessment.\r\nThe Supreme Court, which is empowered to enforce the execution of this\r\nlaw of the Union, exerts its influence not upon a refractory State, but\r\nupon the private taxpayer; and, like the judicial power of other\r\nnations, it is opposed to the person of an individual. It is to be\r\nobserved that the Union chose its own antagonist; and as that\r\nantagonist is feeble, he is naturally worsted.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not brought\r\nforward by but against the Union. The Constitution recognizes the\r\nlegislative power of the States; and a law so enacted may impair the\r\nprivileges of the Union, in which case a collision in unavoidable\r\nbetween that body and the State which has passed the law: and it only\r\nremains to select the least dangerous remedy, which is very clearly\r\ndeducible from the general principles I have before established. *k\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ See Chapter VI. on \xe2\x80\x9cJudicial Power in America.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived that, in the case under consideration, the Union\r\nmight have used the State before a Federal court, which would have\r\nannulled the act, and by this means it would have adopted a natural\r\ncourse of proceeding; but the judicial power would have been placed in\r\nopen hostility to the State, and it was desirable to avoid this\r\npredicament as much as possible. The Americans hold that it is nearly\r\nimpossible that a new law should not impair the interests of some\r\nprivate individual by its provisions: these private interests are\r\nassumed by the American legislators as the ground of attack against\r\nsuch measures as may be prejudicial to the Union, and it is to these\r\ncases that the protection of the Supreme Court is extended.\r\n\r\nSuppose a State vends a certain portion of its territory to a company,\r\nand that a year afterwards it passes a law by which the territory is\r\notherwise disposed of, and that clause of the Constitution which\r\nprohibits laws impairing the obligation of contracts violated. When the\r\npurchaser under the second act appears to take possession, the\r\npossessor under the first act brings his action before the tribunals of\r\nthe Union, and causes the title of the claimant to be pronounced null\r\nand void. *l Thus, in point of fact, the judicial power of the Union is\r\ncontesting the claims of the sovereignty of a State; but it only acts\r\nindirectly and upon a special application of detail: it attacks the law\r\nin its consequences, not in its principle, and it rather weakens than\r\ndestroys it.\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ See Kent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 387.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last hypothesis that remained was that each State formed a\r\ncorporation enjoying a separate existence and distinct civil rights,\r\nand that it could therefore sue or be sued before a tribunal. Thus a\r\nState could bring an action against another State. In this instance the\r\nUnion was not called upon to contest a provincial law, but to try a\r\nsuit in which a State was a party. This suit was perfectly similar to\r\nany other cause, except that the quality of the parties was different;\r\nand here the danger pointed out at the beginning of this chapter exists\r\nwith less chance of being avoided. The inherent disadvantage of the\r\nvery essence of Federal constitutions is that they engender parties in\r\nthe bosom of the nation which present powerful obstacles to the free\r\ncourse of justice.\r\n\r\nHigh Rank Of The Supreme Court Amongst The Great Powers Of State No\r\nnation ever constituted so great a judicial power as the\r\nAmericans\xe2\x80\x94Extent of its prerogative\xe2\x80\x94Its political influence\xe2\x80\x94The\r\ntranquillity and the very existence of the Union depend on the\r\ndiscretion of the seven Federal Judges.\r\n\r\nWhen we have successively examined in detail the organization of the\r\nSupreme Court, and the entire prerogatives which it exercises, we shall\r\nreadily admit that a more imposing judicial power was never constituted\r\nby any people. The Supreme Court is placed at the head of all known\r\ntribunals, both by the nature of its rights and the class of\r\njusticiable parties which it controls.\r\n\r\nIn all the civilized countries of Europe the Government has always\r\nshown the greatest repugnance to allow the cases to which it was itself\r\na party to be decided by the ordinary course of justice. This\r\nrepugnance naturally attains its utmost height in an absolute\r\nGovernment; and, on the other hand, the privileges of the courts of\r\njustice are extended with the increasing liberties of the people: but\r\nno European nation has at present held that all judicial controversies,\r\nwithout regard to their origin, can be decided by the judges of common\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn America this theory has been actually put in practice, and the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States is the sole tribunal of the nation.\r\nIts power extends to all the cases arising under laws and treaties made\r\nby the executive and legislative authorities, to all cases of admiralty\r\nand maritime jurisdiction, and in general to all points which affect\r\nthe law of nations. It may even be affirmed that, although its\r\nconstitution is essentially judicial, its prerogatives are almost\r\nentirely political. Its sole object is to enforce the execution of the\r\nlaws of the Union; and the Union only regulates the relations of the\r\nGovernment with the citizens, and of the nation with Foreign Powers:\r\nthe relations of citizens amongst themselves are almost exclusively\r\nregulated by the sovereignty of the States.\r\n\r\nA second and still greater cause of the preponderance of this court may\r\nbe adduced. In the nations of Europe the courts of justice are only\r\ncalled upon to try the controversies of private individuals; but the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States summons sovereign powers to its bar.\r\nWhen the clerk of the court advances on the steps of the tribunal, and\r\nsimply says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe State of New York versus the State of Ohio,\xe2\x80\x9d it is\r\nimpossible not to feel that the Court which he addresses is no ordinary\r\nbody; and when it is recollected that one of these parties represents\r\none million, and the other two millions of men, one is struck by the\r\nresponsibility of the seven judges whose decision is about to satisfy\r\nor to disappoint so large a number of their fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe peace, the prosperity, and the very existence of the Union are\r\nvested in the hands of the seven judges. Without their active\r\nco-operation the Constitution would be a dead letter: the Executive\r\nappeals to them for assistance against the encroachments of the\r\nlegislative powers; the Legislature demands their protection from the\r\ndesigns of the Executive; they defend the Union from the disobedience\r\nof the States, the States from the exaggerated claims of the Union, the\r\npublic interest against the interests of private citizens, and the\r\nconservative spirit of order against the fleeting innovations of\r\ndemocracy. Their power is enormous, but it is clothed in the authority\r\nof public opinion. They are the all-powerful guardians of a people\r\nwhich respects law, but they would be impotent against popular neglect\r\nor popular contempt. The force of public opinion is the most\r\nintractable of agents, because its exact limits cannot be defined; and\r\nit is not less dangerous to exceed than to remain below the boundary\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nThe Federal judges must not only be good citizens, and men possessed of\r\nthat information and integrity which are indispensable to magistrates,\r\nbut they must be statesmen\xe2\x80\x94politicians, not unread in the signs of the\r\ntimes, not afraid to brave the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow\r\nto turn aside such encroaching elements as may threaten the supremacy\r\nof the Union and the obedience which is due to the laws.\r\n\r\nThe President, who exercises a limited power, may err without causing\r\ngreat mischief in the State. Congress may decide amiss without\r\ndestroying the Union, because the electoral body in which Congress\r\noriginates may cause it to retract its decision by changing its\r\nmembers. But if the Supreme Court is ever composed of imprudent men or\r\nbad citizens, the Union may be plunged into anarchy or civil war.\r\n\r\nThe real cause of this danger, however, does not lie in the\r\nconstitution of the tribunal, but in the very nature of Federal\r\nGovernments. We have observed that in confederate peoples it is\r\nespecially necessary to consolidate the judicial authority, because in\r\nno other nations do those independent persons who are able to cope with\r\nthe social body exist in greater power or in a better condition to\r\nresist the physical strength of the Government. But the more a power\r\nrequires to be strengthened, the more extensive and independent it must\r\nbe made; and the dangers which its abuse may create are heightened by\r\nits independence and its strength. The source of the evil is not,\r\ntherefore, in the constitution of the power, but in the constitution of\r\nthose States which render its existence necessary.\r\n\r\nIn What Respects The Federal Constitution Is Superior To That Of The\r\nStates\r\n\r\nIn what respects the Constitution of the Union can be compared to that\r\nof the States\xe2\x80\x94Superiority of the Constitution of the Union attributable\r\nto the wisdom of the Federal legislators\xe2\x80\x94Legislature of the Union less\r\ndependent on the people than that of the States\xe2\x80\x94Executive power more\r\nindependent in its sphere\xe2\x80\x94Judicial power less subjected to the\r\ninclinations of the majority\xe2\x80\x94Practical consequence of these facts\xe2\x80\x94The\r\ndangers inherent in a democratic government eluded by the Federal\r\nlegislators, and increased by the legislators of the States.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution differs essentially from that of the States in\r\nthe ends which it is intended to accomplish, but in the means by which\r\nthese ends are promoted a greater analogy exists between them. The\r\nobjects of the Governments are different, but their forms are the same;\r\nand in this special point of view there is some advantage in comparing\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the Federal Constitution is superior to all the\r\nConstitutions of the States, for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe present Constitution of the Union was formed at a later period than\r\nthose of the majority of the States, and it may have derived some\r\nameliorations from past experience. But we shall be led to acknowledge\r\nthat this is only a secondary cause of its superiority, when we\r\nrecollect that eleven new States *n have been added to the American\r\nConfederation since the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, and\r\nthat these new republics have always rather exaggerated than avoided\r\nthe defects which existed in the former Constitutions.\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ [The number of States has now risen to 46 (1874), besides the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of the superiority of the Federal Constitution lay in\r\nthe character of the legislators who composed it. At the time when it\r\nwas formed the dangers of the Confederation were imminent, and its ruin\r\nseemed inevitable. In this extremity the people chose the men who most\r\ndeserved the esteem, rather than those who had gained the affections,\r\nof the country. I have already observed that distinguished as almost\r\nall the legislators of the Union were for their intelligence, they were\r\nstill more so for their patriotism. They had all been nurtured at a\r\ntime when the spirit of liberty was braced by a continual struggle\r\nagainst a powerful and predominant authority. When the contest was\r\nterminated, whilst the excited passions of the populace persisted in\r\nwarring with dangers which had ceased to threaten them, these men\r\nstopped short in their career; they cast a calmer and more penetrating\r\nlook upon the country which was now their own; they perceived that the\r\nwar of independence was definitely ended, and that the only dangers\r\nwhich America had to fear were those which might result from the abuse\r\nof the freedom she had won. They had the courage to say what they\r\nbelieved to be true, because they were animated by a warm and sincere\r\nlove of liberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions, because\r\nthey were resolutely opposed to destruction. *o\r\n\r\no\r\n[ At this time Alexander Hamilton, who was one of the principal\r\nfounders of the Constitution, ventured to express the following\r\nsentiments in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist,\xe2\x80\x9d No. 71:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of\r\nthe Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in\r\nthe Legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain\r\nvery crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was\r\ninstituted as of the true means by which the public happiness may be\r\npromoted. The Republican principle demands that the deliberative sense\r\nof the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they\r\nentrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an\r\nunqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every\r\ntransient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men who\r\nflatter their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just\r\nobservation, that the people commonly intend the public good. This\r\noften applies to their very errors. But their good sense would despise\r\nthe adulator who should pretend that they always reason right about the\r\nmeans of promoting it. They know from experience that they sometimes\r\nerr; and the wonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as\r\nthey continually are, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants; by the\r\nsnares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate; by the\r\nartifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve\r\nit, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it. When\r\noccasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are\r\nat variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of persons whom\r\nthey have appointed to be the guardians of those interests to withstand\r\nthe temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for\r\nmore cool and sedate reflection. Instances might be cited in which a\r\nconduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences\r\nof their own mistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their\r\ngratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve\r\nthem at the peril of their displeasure.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the Constitutions of the States assign one year\r\nfor the duration of the House of Representatives, and two years for\r\nthat of the Senate; so that members of the legislative body are\r\nconstantly and narrowly tied down by the slightest desires of their\r\nconstituents. The legislators of the Union were of opinion that this\r\nexcessive dependence of the Legislature tended to alter the nature of\r\nthe main consequences of the representative system, since it vested the\r\nsource, not only of authority, but of government, in the people. They\r\nincreased the length of the time for which the representatives were\r\nreturned, in order to give them freer scope for the exercise of their\r\nown judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution, as well as the Constitutions of the different\r\nStates, divided the legislative body into two branches. But in the\r\nStates these two branches were composed of the same elements, and\r\nelected in the same manner. The consequence was that the passions and\r\ninclinations of the populace were as rapidly and as energetically\r\nrepresented in one chamber as in the other, and that laws were made\r\nwith all the characteristics of violence and precipitation. By the\r\nFederal Constitution the two houses originate in like manner in the\r\nchoice of the people; but the conditions of eligibility and the mode of\r\nelection were changed, to the end that, if, as is the case in certain\r\nnations, one branch of the Legislature represents the same interests as\r\nthe other, it may at least represent a superior degree of intelligence\r\nand discretion. A mature age was made one of the conditions of the\r\nsenatorial dignity, and the Upper House was chosen by an elected\r\nassembly of a limited number of members.\r\n\r\nTo concentrate the whole social force in the hands of the legislative\r\nbody is the natural tendency of democracies; for as this is the power\r\nwhich emanates the most directly from the people, it is made to\r\nparticipate most fully in the preponderating authority of the\r\nmultitude, and it is naturally led to monopolize every species of\r\ninfluence. This concentration is at once prejudicial to a\r\nwell-conducted administration, and favorable to the despotism of the\r\nmajority. The legislators of the States frequently yielded to these\r\ndemocratic propensities, which were invariably and courageously\r\nresisted by the founders of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the States the executive power is vested in the hands of a\r\nmagistrate, who is apparently placed upon a level with the Legislature,\r\nbut who is in reality nothing more than the blind agent and the passive\r\ninstrument of its decisions. He can derive no influence from the\r\nduration of his functions, which terminate with the revolving year, or\r\nfrom the exercise of prerogatives which can scarcely be said to exist.\r\nThe Legislature can condemn him to inaction by intrusting the execution\r\nof the laws to special committees of its own members, and can annul his\r\ntemporary dignity by depriving him of his salary. The Federal\r\nConstitution vests all the privileges and all the responsibility of the\r\nexecutive power in a single individual. The duration of the Presidency\r\nis fixed at four years; the salary of the individual who fills that\r\noffice cannot be altered during the term of his functions; he is\r\nprotected by a body of official dependents, and armed with a suspensive\r\nveto. In short, every effort was made to confer a strong and\r\nindependent position upon the executive authority within the limits\r\nwhich had been prescribed to it.\r\n\r\nIn the Constitutions of all the States the judicial power is that which\r\nremains the most independent of the legislative authority;\r\nnevertheless, in all the States the Legislature has reserved to itself\r\nthe right of regulating the emoluments of the judges, a practice which\r\nnecessarily subjects these magistrates to its immediate influence. In\r\nsome States the judges are only temporarily appointed, which deprives\r\nthem of a great portion of their power and their freedom. In others the\r\nlegislative and judicial powers are entirely confounded; thus the\r\nSenate of New York, for instance, constitutes in certain cases the\r\nSuperior Court of the State. The Federal Constitution, on the other\r\nhand, carefully separates the judicial authority from all external\r\ninfluences; and it provides for the independence of the judges, by\r\ndeclaring that their salary shall not be altered, and that their\r\nfunctions shall be inalienable.\r\n\r\nThe practical consequences of these different systems may easily be\r\nperceived. An attentive observer will soon remark that the business of\r\nthe Union is incomparably better conducted than that of any individual\r\nState. The conduct of the Federal Government is more fair and more\r\ntemperate than that of the States, its designs are more fraught with\r\nwisdom, its projects are more durable and more skilfully combined, its\r\nmeasures are put into execution with more vigor and consistency.\r\n\r\nI recapitulate the substance of this chapter in a few words: The\r\nexistence of democracies is threatened by two dangers, viz., the\r\ncomplete subjection of the legislative body to the caprices of the\r\nelectoral body, and the concentration of all the powers of the\r\nGovernment in the legislative authority. The growth of these evils has\r\nbeen encouraged by the policy of the legislators of the States, but it\r\nhas been resisted by the legislators of the Union by every means which\r\nlay within their control.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics Which Distinguish The Federal Constitution Of The\r\nUnited States Of America From All Other Federal Constitutions American\r\nUnion appears to resemble all other confederations\xe2\x80\x94Nevertheless its\r\neffects are different\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94Distinctions between the Union and\r\nall other confederations\xe2\x80\x94The American Government not a federal but an\r\nimperfect national Government.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America do not afford either the first or the only\r\ninstance of confederate States, several of which have existed in modern\r\nEurope, without adverting to those of antiquity. Switzerland, the\r\nGermanic Empire, and the Republic of the United Provinces either have\r\nbeen or still are confederations. In studying the constitutions of\r\nthese different countries, the politician is surprised to observe that\r\nthe powers with which they invested the Federal Government are nearly\r\nidentical with the privileges awarded by the American Constitution to\r\nthe Government of the United States. They confer upon the central power\r\nthe same rights of making peace and war, of raising money and troops,\r\nand of providing for the general exigencies and the common interests of\r\nthe nation. Nevertheless the Federal Government of these different\r\npeoples has always been as remarkable for its weakness and inefficiency\r\nas that of the Union is for its vigorous and enterprising spirit.\r\nAgain, the first American Confederation perished through the excessive\r\nweakness of its Government; and this weak Government was,\r\nnotwithstanding, in possession of rights even more extensive than those\r\nof the Federal Government of the present day. But the more recent\r\nConstitution of the United States contains certain principles which\r\nexercise a most important influence, although they do not at once\r\nstrike the observer.\r\n\r\nThis Constitution, which may at first sight be confounded with the\r\nfederal constitutions which preceded it, rests upon a novel theory,\r\nwhich may be considered as a great invention in modern political\r\nscience. In all the confederations which had been formed before the\r\nAmerican Constitution of 1789 the allied States agreed to obey the\r\ninjunctions of a Federal Government; but they reserved to themselves\r\nthe right of ordaining and enforcing the execution of the laws of the\r\nUnion. The American States which combined in 1789 agreed that the\r\nFederal Government should not only dictate the laws, but that it should\r\nexecute it own enactments. In both cases the right is the same, but the\r\nexercise of the right is different; and this alteration produced the\r\nmost momentous consequences.\r\n\r\nIn all the confederations which had been formed before the American\r\nUnion the Federal Government demanded its supplies at the hands of the\r\nseparate Governments; and if the measure it prescribed was onerous to\r\nany one of those bodies means were found to evade its claims: if the\r\nState was powerful, it had recourse to arms; if it was weak, it\r\nconnived at the resistance which the law of the Union, its sovereign,\r\nmet with, and resorted to inaction under the plea of inability. Under\r\nthese circumstances one of the two alternatives has invariably\r\noccurred; either the most preponderant of the allied peoples has\r\nassumed the privileges of the Federal authority and ruled all the\r\nStates in its name, *p or the Federal Government has been abandoned by\r\nits natural supporters, anarchy has arisen between the confederates,\r\nand the Union has lost all powers of action. *q\r\n\r\np\r\n[ This was the case in Greece, when Philip undertook to execute the\r\ndecree of the Amphictyons; in the Low Countries, where the province of\r\nHolland always gave the law; and, in our own time, in the Germanic\r\nConfederation, in which Austria and Prussia assume a great degree of\r\ninfluence over the whole country, in the name of the Diet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ Such has always been the situation of the Swiss Confederation, which\r\nwould have perished ages ago but for the mutual jealousies of its\r\nneighbors.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America the subjects of the Union are not States, but private\r\ncitizens: the national Government levies a tax, not upon the State of\r\nMassachusetts, but upon each inhabitant of Massachusetts. All former\r\nconfederate governments presided over communities, but that of the\r\nUnion rules individuals; its force is not borrowed, but self-derived;\r\nand it is served by its own civil and military officers, by its own\r\narmy, and its own courts of justice. It cannot be doubted that the\r\nspirit of the nation, the passions of the multitude, and the provincial\r\nprejudices of each State tend singularly to diminish the authority of a\r\nFederal authority thus constituted, and to facilitate the means of\r\nresistance to its mandates; but the comparative weakness of a\r\nrestricted sovereignty is an evil inherent in the Federal system. In\r\nAmerica, each State has fewer opportunities of resistance and fewer\r\ntemptations to non-compliance; nor can such a design be put in\r\nexecution (if indeed it be entertained) without an open violation of\r\nthe laws of the Union, a direct interruption of the ordinary course of\r\njustice, and a bold declaration of revolt; in a word, without taking a\r\ndecisive step which men hesitate to adopt.\r\n\r\nIn all former confederations the privileges of the Union furnished more\r\nelements of discord than of power, since they multiplied the claims of\r\nthe nation without augmenting the means of enforcing them: and in\r\naccordance with this fact it may be remarked that the real weakness of\r\nfederal governments has almost always been in the exact ratio of their\r\nnominal power. Such is not the case in the American Union, in which, as\r\nin ordinary governments, the Federal Government has the means of\r\nenforcing all it is empowered to demand.\r\n\r\nThe human understanding more easily invents new things than new words,\r\nand we are thence constrained to employ a multitude of improper and\r\ninadequate expressions. When several nations form a permanent league\r\nand establish a supreme authority, which, although it has not the same\r\ninfluence over the members of the community as a national government,\r\nacts upon each of the Confederate States in a body, this Government,\r\nwhich is so essentially different from all others, is denominated a\r\nFederal one. Another form of society is afterwards discovered, in which\r\nseveral peoples are fused into one and the same nation with regard to\r\ncertain common interests, although they remain distinct, or at least\r\nonly confederate, with regard to all their other concerns. In this case\r\nthe central power acts directly upon those whom it governs, whom it\r\nrules, and whom it judges, in the same manner, as, but in a more\r\nlimited circle than, a national government. Here the term Federal\r\nGovernment is clearly no longer applicable to a state of things which\r\nmust be styled an incomplete national Government: a form of government\r\nhas been found out which is neither exactly national nor federal; but\r\nno further progress has been made, and the new word which will one day\r\ndesignate this novel invention does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nThe absence of this new species of confederation has been the cause\r\nwhich has brought all Unions to Civil War, to subjection, or to a\r\nstagnant apathy, and the peoples which formed these leagues have been\r\neither too dull to discern, or too pusillanimous to apply this great\r\nremedy. The American Confederation perished by the same defects.\r\n\r\nBut the Confederate States of America had been long accustomed to form\r\na portion of one empire before they had won their independence; they\r\nhad not contracted the habit of governing themselves, and their\r\nnational prejudices had not taken deep root in their minds. Superior to\r\nthe rest of the world in political knowledge, and sharing that\r\nknowledge equally amongst themselves, they were little agitated by the\r\npassions which generally oppose the extension of federal authority in a\r\nnation, and those passions were checked by the wisdom of the chief\r\ncitizens. The Americans applied the remedy with prudent firmness as\r\nsoon as they were conscious of the evil; they amended their laws, and\r\nthey saved their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter VIII: The Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x94Part V\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages Of The Federal System In General, And Its Special Utility In\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nHappiness and freedom of small nations\xe2\x80\x94Power of great nations\xe2\x80\x94Great\r\nempires favorable to the growth of civilization\xe2\x80\x94Strength often the\r\nfirst element of national prosperity\xe2\x80\x94Aim of the Federal system to unite\r\nthe twofold advantages resulting from a small and from a large\r\nterritory\xe2\x80\x94Advantages derived by the United States from this system\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nlaw adapts itself to the exigencies of the population; population does\r\nnot conform to the exigencies of the law\xe2\x80\x94Activity, amelioration, love\r\nand enjoyment of freedom in the American communities\xe2\x80\x94Public spirit of\r\nthe Union the abstract of provincial patriotism\xe2\x80\x94Principles and things\r\ncirculate freely over the territory of the United States\xe2\x80\x94The Union is\r\nhappy and free as a little nation, and respected as a great empire.\r\n\r\nIn small nations the scrutiny of society penetrates into every part,\r\nand the spirit of improvement enters into the most trifling details; as\r\nthe ambition of the people is necessarily checked by its weakness, all\r\nthe efforts and resources of the citizens are turned to the internal\r\nbenefit of the community, and are not likely to evaporate in the\r\nfleeting breath of glory. The desires of every individual are limited,\r\nbecause extraordinary faculties are rarely to be met with. The gifts of\r\nan equal fortune render the various conditions of life uniform, and the\r\nmanners of the inhabitants are orderly and simple. Thus, if one\r\nestimate the gradations of popular morality and enlightenment, we shall\r\ngenerally find that in small nations there are more persons in easy\r\ncircumstances, a more numerous population, and a more tranquil state of\r\nsociety, than in great empires.\r\n\r\nWhen tyranny is established in the bosom of a small nation, it is more\r\ngalling than elsewhere, because, as it acts within a narrow circle,\r\nevery point of that circle is subject to its direct influence. It\r\nsupplies the place of those great designs which it cannot entertain by\r\na violent or an exasperating interference in a multitude of minute\r\ndetails; and it leaves the political world, to which it properly\r\nbelongs, to meddle with the arrangements of domestic life. Tastes as\r\nwell as actions are to be regulated at its pleasure; and the families\r\nof the citizens as well as the affairs of the State are to be governed\r\nby its decisions. This invasion of rights occurs, however, but seldom,\r\nand freedom is in truth the natural state of small communities. The\r\ntemptations which the Government offers to ambition are too weak, and\r\nthe resources of private individuals are too slender, for the sovereign\r\npower easily to fall within the grasp of a single citizen; and should\r\nsuch an event have occurred, the subjects of the State can without\r\ndifficulty overthrow the tyrant and his oppression by a simultaneous\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nSmall nations have therefore ever been the cradle of political liberty;\r\nand the fact that many of them have lost their immunities by extending\r\ntheir dominion shows that the freedom they enjoyed was more a\r\nconsequence of the inferior size than of the character of the people.\r\n\r\nThe history of the world affords no instance of a great nation\r\nretaining the form of republican government for a long series of years,\r\n*r and this has led to the conclusion that such a state of things is\r\nimpracticable. For my own part, I cannot but censure the imprudence of\r\nattempting to limit the possible and to judge the future on the part of\r\na being who is hourly deceived by the most palpable realities of life,\r\nand who is constantly taken by surprise in the circumstances with which\r\nhe is most familiar. But it may be advanced with confidence that the\r\nexistence of a great republic will always be exposed to far greater\r\nperils than that of a small one.\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ I do not speak of a confederation of small republics, but of a great\r\nconsolidated Republic.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the passions which are most fatal to republican institutions spread\r\nwith an increasing territory, whilst the virtues which maintain their\r\ndignity do not augment in the same proportion. The ambition of the\r\ncitizens increases with the power of the State; the strength of parties\r\nwith the importance of the ends they have in view; but that devotion to\r\nthe common weal which is the surest check on destructive passions is\r\nnot stronger in a large than in a small republic. It might, indeed, be\r\nproved without difficulty that it is less powerful and less sincere.\r\nThe arrogance of wealth and the dejection of wretchedness, capital\r\ncities of unwonted extent, a lax morality, a vulgar egotism, and a\r\ngreat confusion of interests, are the dangers which almost invariably\r\narise from the magnitude of States. But several of these evils are\r\nscarcely prejudicial to a monarchy, and some of them contribute to\r\nmaintain its existence. In monarchical States the strength of the\r\ngovernment is its own; it may use, but it does not depend on, the\r\ncommunity, and the authority of the prince is proportioned to the\r\nprosperity of the nation; but the only security which a republican\r\ngovernment possesses against these evils lies in the support of the\r\nmajority. This support is not, however, proportionably greater in a\r\nlarge republic than it is in a small one; and thus, whilst the means of\r\nattack perpetually increase both in number and in influence, the power\r\nof resistance remains the same, or it may rather be said to diminish,\r\nsince the propensities and interests of the people are diversified by\r\nthe increase of the population, and the difficulty of forming a compact\r\nmajority is constantly augmented. It has been observed, moreover, that\r\nthe intensity of human passions is heightened, not only by the\r\nimportance of the end which they propose to attain, but by the\r\nmultitude of individuals who are animated by them at the same time.\r\nEvery one has had occasion to remark that his emotions in the midst of\r\na sympathizing crowd are far greater than those which he would have\r\nfelt in solitude. In great republics the impetus of political passion\r\nis irresistible, not only because it aims at gigantic purposes, but\r\nbecause it is felt and shared by millions of men at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be asserted as a general proposition that nothing is\r\nmore opposed to the well-being and the freedom of man than vast\r\nempires. Nevertheless it is important to acknowledge the peculiar\r\nadvantages of great States. For the very reason which renders the\r\ndesire of power more intense in these communities than amongst ordinary\r\nmen, the love of glory is also more prominent in the hearts of a class\r\nof citizens, who regard the applause of a great people as a reward\r\nworthy of their exertions, and an elevating encouragement to man. If we\r\nwould learn why it is that great nations contribute more powerfully to\r\nthe spread of human improvement than small States, we shall discover an\r\nadequate cause in the rapid and energetic circulation of ideas, and in\r\nthose great cities which are the intellectual centres where all the\r\nrays of human genius are reflected and combined. To this it may be\r\nadded that most important discoveries demand a display of national\r\npower which the Government of a small State is unable to make; in great\r\nnations the Government entertains a greater number of general notions,\r\nand is more completely disengaged from the routine of precedent and the\r\negotism of local prejudice; its designs are conceived with more talent,\r\nand executed with more boldness.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace the well-being of small nations is undoubtedly more\r\ngeneral and more complete, but they are apt to suffer more acutely from\r\nthe calamities of war than those great empires whose distant frontiers\r\nmay for ages avert the presence of the danger from the mass of the\r\npeople, which is therefore more frequently afflicted than ruined by the\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nBut in this matter, as in many others, the argument derived from the\r\nnecessity of the case predominates over all others. If none but small\r\nnations existed, I do not doubt that mankind would be more happy and\r\nmore free; but the existence of great nations is unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThis consideration introduces the element of physical strength as a\r\ncondition of national prosperity. It profits a people but little to be\r\naffluent and free if it is perpetually exposed to be pillaged or\r\nsubjugated; the number of its manufactures and the extent of its\r\ncommerce are of small advantage if another nation has the empire of the\r\nseas and gives the law in all the markets of the globe. Small nations\r\nare often impoverished, not because they are small, but because they\r\nare weak; the great empires prosper less because they are great than\r\nbecause they are strong. Physical strength is therefore one of the\r\nfirst conditions of the happiness and even of the existence of nations.\r\nHence it occurs that, unless very peculiar circumstances intervene,\r\nsmall nations are always united to large empires in the end, either by\r\nforce or by their own consent: yet I am unacquainted with a more\r\ndeplorable spectacle than that of a people unable either to defend or\r\nto maintain its independence.\r\n\r\nThe Federal system was created with the intention of combining the\r\ndifferent advantages which result from the greater and the lesser\r\nextent of nations; and a single glance over the United States of\r\nAmerica suffices to discover the advantages which they have derived\r\nfrom its adoption.\r\n\r\nIn great centralized nations the legislator is obliged to impart a\r\ncharacter of uniformity to the laws which does not always suit the\r\ndiversity of customs and of districts; as he takes no cognizance of\r\nspecial cases, he can only proceed upon general principles; and the\r\npopulation is obliged to conform to the exigencies of the legislation,\r\nsince the legislation cannot adapt itself to the exigencies and the\r\ncustoms of the population, which is the cause of endless trouble and\r\nmisery. This disadvantage does not exist in confederations. Congress\r\nregulates the principal measures of the national Government, and all\r\nthe details of the administration are reserved to the provincial\r\nlegislatures. It is impossible to imagine how much this division of\r\nsovereignty contributes to the well-being of each of the States which\r\ncompose the Union. In these small communities, which are never agitated\r\nby the desire of aggrandizement or the cares of self-defence, all\r\npublic authority and private energy is employed in internal\r\namelioration. The central government of each State, which is in\r\nimmediate juxtaposition to the citizens, is daily apprised of the wants\r\nwhich arise in society; and new projects are proposed every year, which\r\nare discussed either at town meetings or by the legislature of the\r\nState, and which are transmitted by the press to stimulate the zeal and\r\nto excite the interest of the citizens. This spirit of amelioration is\r\nconstantly alive in the American republics, without compromising their\r\ntranquillity; the ambition of power yields to the less refined and less\r\ndangerous love of comfort. It is generally believed in America that the\r\nexistence and the permanence of the republican form of government in\r\nthe New World depend upon the existence and the permanence of the\r\nFederal system; and it is not unusual to attribute a large share of the\r\nmisfortunes which have befallen the new States of South America to the\r\ninjudicious erection of great republics, instead of a divided and\r\nconfederate sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is incontestably true that the love and the habits of republican\r\ngovernment in the United States were engendered in the townships and in\r\nthe provincial assemblies. In a small State, like that of Connecticut\r\nfor instance, where cutting a canal or laying down a road is a\r\nmomentous political question, where the State has no army to pay and no\r\nwars to carry on, and where much wealth and much honor cannot be\r\nbestowed upon the chief citizens, no form of government can be more\r\nnatural or more appropriate than that of a republic. But it is this\r\nsame republican spirit, it is these manners and customs of a free\r\npeople, which are engendered and nurtured in the different States, to\r\nbe afterwards applied to the country at large. The public spirit of the\r\nUnion is, so to speak, nothing more than an abstract of the patriotic\r\nzeal of the provinces. Every citizen of the United States transfuses\r\nhis attachment to his little republic in the common store of American\r\npatriotism. In defending the Union he defends the increasing prosperity\r\nof his own district, the right of conducting its affairs, and the hope\r\nof causing measures of improvement to be adopted which may be favorable\r\nto his own interest; and these are motives which are wont to stir men\r\nmore readily than the general interests of the country and the glory of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the temper and the manners of the inhabitants\r\nespecially fitted them to promote the welfare of a great republic, the\r\nFederal system smoothed the obstacles which they might have\r\nencountered. The confederation of all the American States presents none\r\nof the ordinary disadvantages resulting from great agglomerations of\r\nmen. The Union is a great republic in extent, but the paucity of\r\nobjects for which its Government provides assimilates it to a small\r\nState. Its acts are important, but they are rare. As the sovereignty of\r\nthe Union is limited and incomplete, its exercise is not incompatible\r\nwith liberty; for it does not excite those insatiable desires of fame\r\nand power which have proved so fatal to great republics. As there is no\r\ncommon centre to the country, vast capital cities, colossal wealth,\r\nabject poverty, and sudden revolutions are alike unknown; and political\r\npassion, instead of spreading over the land like a torrent of\r\ndesolation, spends its strength against the interests and the\r\nindividual passions of every State.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all commodities and ideas circulate throughout the Union\r\nas freely as in a country inhabited by one people. Nothing checks the\r\nspirit of enterprise. Government avails itself of the assistance of all\r\nwho have talents or knowledge to serve it. Within the frontiers of the\r\nUnion the profoundest peace prevails, as within the heart of some great\r\nempire; abroad, it ranks with the most powerful nations of the earth;\r\ntwo thousand miles of coast are open to the commerce of the world; and\r\nas it possesses the keys of the globe, its flags is respected in the\r\nmost remote seas. The Union is as happy and as free as a small people,\r\nand as glorious and as strong as a great nation.\r\n\r\nWhy The Federal System Is Not Adapted To All Peoples, And How The\r\nAnglo-Americans Were Enabled To Adopt It.\r\n\r\nEvery Federal system contains defects which baffle the efforts of the\r\nlegislator\xe2\x80\x94The Federal system is complex\xe2\x80\x94It demands a daily exercise of\r\ndiscretion on the part of the citizens\xe2\x80\x94Practical knowledge of\r\ngovernment common amongst the Americans\xe2\x80\x94Relative weakness of the\r\nGovernment of the Union, another defect inherent in the Federal\r\nsystem\xe2\x80\x94The Americans have diminished without remedying it\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nsovereignty of the separate States apparently weaker, but really\r\nstronger, than that of the Union\xe2\x80\x94Why?\xe2\x80\x94Natural causes of union must\r\nexist between confederate peoples besides the laws\xe2\x80\x94What these causes\r\nare amongst the Anglo-Americans\xe2\x80\x94Maine and Georgia, separated by a\r\ndistance of a thousand miles, more naturally united than Normandy and\r\nBrittany\xe2\x80\x94War, the main peril of confederations\xe2\x80\x94This proved even by the\r\nexample of the United States\xe2\x80\x94The Union has no great wars to\r\nfear\xe2\x80\x94Why?\xe2\x80\x94Dangers to which Europeans would be exposed if they adopted\r\nthe Federal system of the Americans.\r\n\r\nWhen a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exercising an\r\nindirect influence upon the destiny of nations, his genius is lauded by\r\nmankind, whilst, in point of fact, the geographical position of the\r\ncountry which he is unable to change, a social condition which arose\r\nwithout his co-operation, manners and opinions which he cannot trace to\r\ntheir source, and an origin with which he is unacquainted, exercise so\r\nirresistible an influence over the courses of society that he is\r\nhimself borne away by the current, after an ineffectual resistance.\r\nLike the navigator, he may direct the vessel which bears him along, but\r\nhe can neither change its structure, nor raise the winds, nor lull the\r\nwaters which swell beneath him.\r\n\r\nI have shown the advantages which the Americans derive from their\r\nfederal system; it remains for me to point out the circumstances which\r\nrendered that system practicable, as its benefits are not to be enjoyed\r\nby all nations. The incidental defects of the Federal system which\r\noriginate in the laws may be corrected by the skill of the legislator,\r\nbut there are further evils inherent in the system which cannot be\r\ncounteracted by the peoples which adopt it. These nations must\r\ntherefore find the strength necessary to support the natural\r\nimperfections of their Government.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent evil of all Federal systems is the very complex\r\nnature of the means they employ. Two sovereignties are necessarily in\r\npresence of each other. The legislator may simplify and equalize the\r\naction of these two sovereignties, by limiting each of them to a sphere\r\nof authority accurately defined; but he cannot combine them into one,\r\nor prevent them from coming into collision at certain points. The\r\nFederal system therefore rests upon a theory which is necessarily\r\ncomplicated, and which demands the daily exercise of a considerable\r\nshare of discretion on the part of those it governs.\r\n\r\nA proposition must be plain to be adopted by the understanding of a\r\npeople. A false notion which is clear and precise will always meet with\r\na greater number of adherents in the world than a true principle which\r\nis obscure or involved. Hence it arises that parties, which are like\r\nsmall communities in the heart of the nation, invariably adopt some\r\nprinciple or some name as a symbol, which very inadequately represents\r\nthe end they have in view and the means which are at their disposal,\r\nbut without which they could neither act nor subsist. The governments\r\nwhich are founded upon a single principle or a single feeling which is\r\neasily defined are perhaps not the best, but they are unquestionably\r\nthe strongest and the most durable in the world.\r\n\r\nIn examining the Constitution of the United States, which is the most\r\nperfect federal constitution that ever existed, one is startled, on the\r\nother hand, at the variety of information and the excellence of\r\ndiscretion which it presupposes in the people whom it is meant to\r\ngovern. The government of the Union depends entirely upon legal\r\nfictions; the Union is an ideal nation which only exists in the mind,\r\nand whose limits and extent can only be discerned by the understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen once the general theory is comprehended, numberless difficulties\r\nremain to be solved in its application; for the sovereignty of the\r\nUnion is so involved in that of the States that it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish its boundaries at the first glance. The whole structure of\r\nthe Government is artificial and conventional; and it would be ill\r\nadapted to a people which has not been long accustomed to conduct its\r\nown affairs, or to one in which the science of politics has not\r\ndescended to the humblest classes of society. I have never been more\r\nstruck by the good sense and the practical judgment of the Americans\r\nthan in the ingenious devices by which they elude the numberless\r\ndifficulties resulting from their Federal Constitution. I scarcely ever\r\nmet with a plain American citizen who could not distinguish, with\r\nsurprising facility, the obligations created by the laws of Congress\r\nfrom those created by the laws of his own State; and who, after having\r\ndiscriminated between the matters which come under the cognizance of\r\nthe Union and those which the local legislature is competent to\r\nregulate, could not point out the exact limit of the several\r\njurisdictions of the Federal courts and the tribunals of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States is like those exquisite\r\nproductions of human industry which ensure wealth and renown to their\r\ninventors, but which are profitless in any other hands. This truth is\r\nexemplified by the condition of Mexico at the present time. The\r\nMexicans were desirous of establishing a federal system, and they took\r\nthe Federal Constitution of their neighbors, the Anglo-Americans, as\r\ntheir model, and copied it with considerable accuracy. *s But although\r\nthey had borrowed the letter of the law, they were unable to create or\r\nto introduce the spirit and the sense which give it life. They were\r\ninvolved in ceaseless embarrassments between the mechanism of their\r\ndouble government; the sovereignty of the States and that of the Union\r\nperpetually exceeded their respective privileges, and entered into\r\ncollision; and to the present day Mexico is alternately the victim of\r\nanarchy and the slave of military despotism.\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ See the Mexican Constitution of 1824.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second and the most fatal of all the defects I have alluded to, and\r\nthat which I believe to be inherent in the federal system, is the\r\nrelative weakness of the government of the Union. The principle upon\r\nwhich all confederations rest is that of a divided sovereignty. The\r\nlegislator may render this partition less perceptible, he may even\r\nconceal it for a time from the public eye, but he cannot prevent it\r\nfrom existing, and a divided sovereignty must always be less powerful\r\nthan an entire supremacy. The reader has seen in the remarks I have\r\nmade on the Constitution of the United States that the Americans have\r\ndisplayed singular ingenuity in combining the restriction of the power\r\nof the Union within the narrow limits of a federal government with the\r\nsemblance and, to a certain extent, with the force of a national\r\ngovernment. By this means the legislators of the Union have succeeded\r\nin diminishing, though not in counteracting the natural danger of\r\nconfederations.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the American Government does not apply itself\r\nto the States, but that it immediately transmits its injunctions to the\r\ncitizens, and compels them as isolated individuals to comply with its\r\ndemands. But if the Federal law were to clash with the interests and\r\nthe prejudices of a State, it might be feared that all the citizens of\r\nthat State would conceive themselves to be interested in the cause of a\r\nsingle individual who should refuse to obey. If all the citizens of the\r\nState were aggrieved at the same time and in the same manner by the\r\nauthority of the Union, the Federal Government would vainly attempt to\r\nsubdue them individually; they would instinctively unite in a common\r\ndefence, and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from the\r\nshare of sovereignty which the institution of their State allows them\r\nto enjoy. Fiction would give way to reality, and an organized portion\r\nof the territory might then contest the central authority. *t The same\r\nobservation holds good with regard to the Federal jurisdiction. If the\r\ncourts of the Union violated an important law of a State in a private\r\ncase, the real, if not the apparent, contest would arise between the\r\naggrieved State represented by a citizen and the Union represented by\r\nits courts of justice. *u\r\n\r\nt\r\n[ [This is precisely what occurred in 1862, and the following paragraph\r\ndescribes correctly the feelings and notions of the South. General Lee\r\nheld that his primary allegiance was due, not to the Union, but to\r\nVirginia.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nu\r\n[ For instance, the Union possesses by the Constitution the right of\r\nselling unoccupied lands for its own profit. Supposing that the State\r\nof Ohio should claim the same right in behalf of certain territories\r\nlying within its boundaries, upon the plea that the Constitution refers\r\nto those lands alone which do not belong to the jurisdiction of any\r\nparticular State, and consequently should choose to dispose of them\r\nitself, the litigation would be carried on in the names of the\r\npurchasers from the State of Ohio and the purchasers from the Union,\r\nand not in the names of Ohio and the Union. But what would become of\r\nthis legal fiction if the Federal purchaser was confirmed in his right\r\nby the courts of the Union, whilst the other competitor was ordered to\r\nretain possession by the tribunals of the State of Ohio?]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe would have but a partial knowledge of the world who should imagine\r\nthat it is possible, by the aid of legal fictions, to prevent men from\r\nfinding out and employing those means of gratifying their passions\r\nwhich have been left open to them; and it may be doubted whether the\r\nAmerican legislators, when they rendered a collision between the two\r\nsovereigns less probable, destroyed the cause of such a misfortune. But\r\nit may even be affirmed that they were unable to ensure the\r\npreponderance of the Federal element in a case of this kind. The Union\r\nis possessed of money and of troops, but the affections and the\r\nprejudices of the people are in the bosom of the States. The\r\nsovereignty of the Union is an abstract being, which is connected with\r\nbut few external objects; the sovereignty of the States is hourly\r\nperceptible, easily understood, constantly active; and if the former is\r\nof recent creation, the latter is coeval with the people itself. The\r\nsovereignty of the Union is factitious, that of the States is natural,\r\nand derives its existence from its own simple influence, like the\r\nauthority of a parent. The supreme power of the nation only affects a\r\nfew of the chief interests of society; it represents an immense but\r\nremote country, and claims a feeling of patriotism which is vague and\r\nill defined; but the authority of the States controls every individual\r\ncitizen at every hour and in all circumstances; it protects his\r\nproperty, his freedom, and his life; and when we recollect the\r\ntraditions, the customs, the prejudices of local and familiar\r\nattachment with which it is connected, we cannot doubt of the\r\nsuperiority of a power which is interwoven with every circumstance that\r\nrenders the love of one\xe2\x80\x99s native country instinctive in the human\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nSince legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous collisions as\r\noccur between the two sovereignties which coexist in the federal\r\nsystem, their first object must be, not only to dissuade the\r\nconfederate States from warfare, but to encourage such institutions as\r\nmay promote the maintenance of peace. Hence it results that the Federal\r\ncompact cannot be lasting unless there exists in the communities which\r\nare leagued together a certain number of inducements to union which\r\nrender their common dependence agreeable, and the task of the\r\nGovernment light, and that system cannot succeed without the presence\r\nof favorable circumstances added to the influence of good laws. All the\r\npeoples which have ever formed a confederation have been held together\r\nby a certain number of common interests, which served as the\r\nintellectual ties of association.\r\n\r\nBut the sentiments and the principles of man must be taken into\r\nconsideration as well as his immediate interests. A certain uniformity\r\nof civilization is not less necessary to the durability of a\r\nconfederation than a uniformity of interests in the States which\r\ncompose it. In Switzerland the difference which exists between the\r\nCanton of Uri and the Canton of Vaud is equal to that between the\r\nfifteenth and the nineteenth centuries; and, properly speaking,\r\nSwitzerland has never possessed a federal government. The union between\r\nthese two cantons only subsists upon the map, and their discrepancies\r\nwould soon be perceived if an attempt were made by a central authority\r\nto prescribe the same laws to the whole territory.\r\n\r\nOne of the circumstances which most powerfully contribute to support\r\nthe Federal Government in America is that the States have not only\r\nsimilar interests, a common origin, and a common tongue, but that they\r\nare also arrived at the same stage of civilization; which almost always\r\nrenders a union feasible. I do not know of any European nation, how\r\nsmall soever it may be, which does not present less uniformity in its\r\ndifferent provinces than the American people, which occupies a\r\nterritory as extensive as one-half of Europe. The distance from the\r\nState of Maine to that of Georgia is reckoned at about one thousand\r\nmiles; but the difference between the civilization of Maine and that of\r\nGeorgia is slighter than the difference between the habits of Normandy\r\nand those of Brittany. Maine and Georgia, which are placed at the\r\nopposite extremities of a great empire, are consequently in the natural\r\npossession of more real inducements to form a confederation than\r\nNormandy and Brittany, which are only separated by a bridge.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the country contributed to increase the\r\nfacilities which the American legislators derived from the manners and\r\ncustoms of the inhabitants; and it is to this circumstance that the\r\nadoption and the maintenance of the Federal system are mainly\r\nattributable.\r\n\r\nThe most important occurrence which can mark the annals of a people is\r\nthe breaking out of a war. In war a people struggles with the energy of\r\na single man against foreign nations in the defence of its very\r\nexistence. The skill of a government, the good sense of the community,\r\nand the natural fondness which men entertain for their country, may\r\nsuffice to maintain peace in the interior of a district, and to favor\r\nits internal prosperity; but a nation can only carry on a great war at\r\nthe cost of more numerous and more painful sacrifices; and to suppose\r\nthat a great number of men will of their own accord comply with these\r\nexigencies of the State is to betray an ignorance of mankind. All the\r\npeoples which have been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare\r\nhave consequently been led to augment the power of their government.\r\nThose which have not succeeded in this attempt have been subjugated. A\r\nlong war almost always places nations in the wretched alternative of\r\nbeing abandoned to ruin by defeat or to despotism by success. War\r\ntherefore renders the symptoms of the weakness of a government most\r\npalpable and most alarming; and I have shown that the inherent defeat\r\nof federal governments is that of being weak.\r\n\r\nThe Federal system is not only deficient in every kind of centralized\r\nadministration, but the central government itself is imperfectly\r\norganized, which is invariably an influential cause of inferiority when\r\nthe nation is opposed to other countries which are themselves governed\r\nby a single authority. In the Federal Constitution of the United\r\nStates, by which the central government possesses more real force, this\r\nevil is still extremely sensible. An example will illustrate the case\r\nto the reader.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution confers upon Congress the right of calling forth\r\nmilitia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and\r\nrepel invasions; and another article declares that the President of the\r\nUnited States is the commander-in-chief of the militia. In the war of\r\n1812 the President ordered the militia of the Northern States to march\r\nto the frontiers; but Connecticut and Massachusetts, whose interests\r\nwere impaired by the war, refused to obey the command. They argued that\r\nthe Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to call forth the\r\nmilitia in case of insurrection or invasion, but that in the present\r\ninstance there was neither invasion nor insurrection. They added, that\r\nthe same Constitution which conferred upon the Union the right of\r\ncalling forth the militia reserved to the States that of naming the\r\nofficers; and that consequently (as they understood the clause) no\r\nofficer of the Union had any right to command the militia, even during\r\nwar, except the President in person; and in this case they were ordered\r\nto join an army commanded by another individual. These absurd and\r\npernicious doctrines received the sanction not only of the governors\r\nand the legislative bodies, but also of the courts of justice in both\r\nStates; and the Federal Government was constrained to raise elsewhere\r\nthe troops which it required. *v\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ Kent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 244. I have selected an example\r\nwhich relates to a time posterior to the promulgation of the present\r\nConstitution. If I had gone back to the days of the Confederation, I\r\nmight have given still more striking instances. The whole nation was at\r\nthat time in a state of enthusiastic excitement; the Revolution was\r\nrepresented by a man who was the idol of the people; but at that very\r\nperiod Congress had, to say the truth, no resources at all at its\r\ndisposal. Troops and supplies were perpetually wanting. The\r\nbest-devised projects failed in the execution, and the Union, which was\r\nconstantly on the verge of destruction, was saved by the weakness of\r\nits enemies far more than by its own strength. [All doubt as to the\r\npowers of the Federal Executive was, however, removed by its efforts in\r\nthe Civil War, and those powers were largely extended.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only safeguard which the American Union, with all the relative\r\nperfection of its laws, possesses against the dissolution which would\r\nbe produced by a great war, lies in its probable exemption from that\r\ncalamity. Placed in the centre of an immense continent, which offers a\r\nboundless field for human industry, the Union is almost as much\r\ninsulated from the world as if its frontiers were girt by the ocean.\r\nCanada contains only a million of inhabitants, and its population is\r\ndivided into two inimical nations. The rigor of the climate limits the\r\nextension of its territory, and shuts up its ports during the six\r\nmonths of winter. From Canada to the Gulf of Mexico a few savage tribes\r\nare to be met with, which retire, perishing in their retreat, before\r\nsix thousand soldiers. To the South, the Union has a point of contact\r\nwith the empire of Mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities\r\nmay one day be expected to arise. But for a long while to come the\r\nuncivilized state of the Mexican community, the depravity of its\r\nmorals, and its extreme poverty, will prevent that country from ranking\r\nhigh amongst nations. *w As for the Powers of Europe, they are too\r\ndistant to be formidable.\r\n\r\nw\r\n[ [War broke out between the United States and Mexico in 1846, and\r\nended in the conquest of an immense territory, including California.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of the United States does not, then, consist in a\r\nFederal Constitution which allows them to carry on great wars, but in a\r\ngeographical position which renders such enterprises extremely\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nNo one can be more inclined than I am myself to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of the federal system, which I hold to be one of the\r\ncombinations most favorable to the prosperity and freedom of man. I\r\nenvy the lot of those nations which have been enabled to adopt it; but\r\nI cannot believe that any confederate peoples could maintain a long or\r\nan equal contest with a nation of similar strength in which the\r\ngovernment should be centralized. A people which should divide its\r\nsovereignty into fractional powers, in the presence of the great\r\nmilitary monarchies of Europe, would, in my opinion, by that very act,\r\nabdicate its power, and perhaps its existence and its name. But such is\r\nthe admirable position of the New World that man has no other enemy\r\nthan himself; and that, in order to be happy and to be free, it\r\nsuffices to seek the gifts of prosperity and the knowledge of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter IX: Why The People May Strictly Be Said To Govern In The\r\n United\r\n\r\n\r\nStates\r\n\r\nI have hitherto examined the institutions of the United States; I have\r\npassed their legislation in review, and I have depicted the present\r\ncharacteristics of political society in that country. But a sovereign\r\npower exists above these institutions and beyond these characteristic\r\nfeatures which may destroy or modify them at its pleasure\xe2\x80\x94I mean that\r\nof the people. It remains to be shown in what manner this power, which\r\nregulates the laws, acts: its propensities and its passions remain to\r\nbe pointed out, as well as the secret springs which retard, accelerate,\r\nor direct its irresistible course; and the effects of its unbounded\r\nauthority, with the destiny which is probably reserved for it.\r\n\r\nIn America the people appoints the legislative and the executive power,\r\nand furnishes the jurors who punish all offences against the laws. The\r\nAmerican institutions are democratic, not only in their principle but\r\nin all their consequences; and the people elects its representatives\r\ndirectly, and for the most part annually, in order to ensure their\r\ndependence. The people is therefore the real directing power; and\r\nalthough the form of government is representative, it is evident that\r\nthe opinions, the prejudices, the interests, and even the passions of\r\nthe community are hindered by no durable obstacles from exercising a\r\nperpetual influence on society. In the United States the majority\r\ngoverns in the name of the people, as is the case in all the countries\r\nin which the people is supreme. The majority is principally composed of\r\npeaceful citizens who, either by inclination or by interest, are\r\nsincerely desirous of the welfare of their country. But they are\r\nsurrounded by the incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain\r\ntheir co-operation and to avail themselves of their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter X: Parties In The United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat distinction to be made between parties\xe2\x80\x94Parties which are to each\r\nother as rival nations\xe2\x80\x94Parties properly so called\xe2\x80\x94Difference between\r\ngreat and small parties\xe2\x80\x94Epochs which produce them\xe2\x80\x94Their\r\ncharacteristics\xe2\x80\x94America has had great parties\xe2\x80\x94They are\r\nextinct\xe2\x80\x94Federalists\xe2\x80\x94Republicans\xe2\x80\x94Defeat of the Federalists\xe2\x80\x94Difficulty of\r\ncreating parties in the United States\xe2\x80\x94What is done with this\r\nintention\xe2\x80\x94Aristocratic or democratic character to be met with in all\r\nparties\xe2\x80\x94Struggle of General Jackson against the Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Parties In The United States\r\n\r\n\r\nA great distinction must be made between parties. Some countries are so\r\nlarge that the different populations which inhabit them have\r\ncontradictory interests, although they are the subjects of the same\r\nGovernment, and they may thence be in a perpetual state of opposition.\r\nIn this case the different fractions of the people may more properly be\r\nconsidered as distinct nations than as mere parties; and if a civil war\r\nbreaks out, the struggle is carried on by rival peoples rather than by\r\nfactions in the State.\r\n\r\nBut when the citizens entertain different opinions upon subjects which\r\naffect the whole country alike, such, for instance, as the principles\r\nupon which the government is to be conducted, then distinctions arise\r\nwhich may correctly be styled parties. Parties are a necessary evil in\r\nfree governments; but they have not at all times the same character and\r\nthe same propensities.\r\n\r\nAt certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such insupportable\r\nevils as to conceive the design of effecting a total change in its\r\npolitical constitution; at other times the mischief lies still deeper,\r\nand the existence of society itself is endangered. Such are the times\r\nof great revolutions and of great parties. But between these epochs of\r\nmisery and of confusion there are periods during which human society\r\nseems to rest, and mankind to make a pause. This pause is, indeed, only\r\napparent, for time does not stop its course for nations any more than\r\nfor men; they are all advancing towards a goal with which they are\r\nunacquainted; and we only imagine them to be stationary when their\r\nprogress escapes our observation, as men who are going at a foot-pace\r\nseem to be standing still to those who run.\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, there are certain epochs at which the changes\r\nthat take place in the social and political constitution of nations are\r\nso slow and so insensible that men imagine their present condition to\r\nbe a final state; and the human mind, believing itself to be firmly\r\nbased upon certain foundations, does not extend its researches beyond\r\nthe horizon which it descries. These are the times of small parties and\r\nof intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe political parties which I style great are those which cling to\r\nprinciples more than to their consequences; to general, and not to\r\nespecial cases; to ideas, and not to men. These parties are usually\r\ndistinguished by a nobler character, by more generous passions, more\r\ngenuine convictions, and a more bold and open conduct than the others.\r\nIn them private interest, which always plays the chief part in\r\npolitical passions, is more studiously veiled under the pretext of the\r\npublic good; and it may even be sometimes concealed from the eyes of\r\nthe very persons whom it excites and impels.\r\n\r\nMinor parties are, on the other hand, generally deficient in political\r\nfaith. As they are not sustained or dignified by a lofty purpose, they\r\nostensibly display the egotism of their character in their actions.\r\nThey glow with a factitious zeal; their language is vehement, but their\r\nconduct is timid and irresolute. The means they employ are as wretched\r\nas the end at which they aim. Hence it arises that when a calm state of\r\nthings succeeds a violent revolution, the leaders of society seem\r\nsuddenly to disappear, and the powers of the human mind to lie\r\nconcealed. Society is convulsed by great parties, by minor ones it is\r\nagitated; it is torn by the former, by the latter it is degraded; and\r\nif these sometimes save it by a salutary perturbation, those invariably\r\ndisturb it to no good end.\r\n\r\nAmerica has already lost the great parties which once divided the\r\nnation; and if her happiness is considerably increased, her morality\r\nhas suffered by their extinction. When the War of Independence was\r\nterminated, and the foundations of the new Government were to be laid\r\ndown, the nation was divided between two opinions\xe2\x80\x94two opinions which\r\nare as old as the world, and which are perpetually to be met with under\r\nall the forms and all the names which have ever obtained in free\r\ncommunities\xe2\x80\x94the one tending to limit, the other to extend indefinitely,\r\nthe power of the people. The conflict of these two opinions never\r\nassumed that degree of violence in America which it has frequently\r\ndisplayed elsewhere. Both parties of the Americans were, in fact,\r\nagreed upon the most essential points; and neither of them had to\r\ndestroy a traditionary constitution, or to overthrow the structure of\r\nsociety, in order to ensure its own triumph. In neither of them,\r\nconsequently, were a great number of private interests affected by\r\nsuccess or by defeat; but moral principles of a high order, such as the\r\nlove of equality and of independence, were concerned in the struggle,\r\nand they sufficed to kindle violent passions.\r\n\r\nThe party which desired to limit the power of the people endeavored to\r\napply its doctrines more especially to the Constitution of the Union,\r\nwhence it derived its name of Federal. The other party, which affected\r\nto be more exclusively attached to the cause of liberty, took that of\r\nRepublican. America is a land of democracy, and the Federalists were\r\nalways in a minority; but they reckoned on their side almost all the\r\ngreat men who had been called forth by the War of Independence, and\r\ntheir moral influence was very considerable. Their cause was, moreover,\r\nfavored by circumstances. The ruin of the Confederation had impressed\r\nthe people with a dread of anarchy, and the Federalists did not fail to\r\nprofit by this transient disposition of the multitude. For ten or\r\ntwelve years they were at the head of affairs, and they were able to\r\napply some, though not all, of their principles; for the hostile\r\ncurrent was becoming from day to day too violent to be checked or\r\nstemmed. In 1801 the Republicans got possession of the Government;\r\nThomas Jefferson was named President; and he increased the influence of\r\ntheir party by the weight of his celebrity, the greatness of his\r\ntalents, and the immense extent of his popularity.\r\n\r\nThe means by which the Federalists had maintained their position were\r\nartificial, and their resources were temporary; it was by the virtues\r\nor the talents of their leaders that they had risen to power. When the\r\nRepublicans attained to that lofty station, their opponents were\r\noverwhelmed by utter defeat. An immense majority declared itself\r\nagainst the retiring party, and the Federalists found themselves in so\r\nsmall a minority that they at once despaired of their future success.\r\nFrom that moment the Republican or Democratic party *a has proceeded\r\nfrom conquest to conquest, until it has acquired absolute supremacy in\r\nthe country. The Federalists, perceiving that they were vanquished\r\nwithout resource, and isolated in the midst of the nation, fell into\r\ntwo divisions, of which one joined the victorious Republicans, and the\r\nother abandoned its rallying-point and its name. Many years have\r\nalready elapsed since they ceased to exist as a party.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ [It is scarcely necessary to remark that in more recent times the\r\nsignification of these terms has changed. The Republicans are the\r\nrepresentatives of the old Federalists, and the Democrats of the old\r\nRepublicans.\xe2\x80\x94Trans. Note (1861).]] The accession of the Federalists to\r\npower was, in my opinion, one of the most fortunate incidents which\r\naccompanied the formation of the great American Union; they resisted\r\nthe inevitable propensities of their age and of the country. But\r\nwhether their theories were good or bad, they had the effect of being\r\ninapplicable, as a system, to the society which they professed to\r\ngovern, and that which occurred under the auspices of Jefferson must\r\ntherefore have taken place sooner or later. But their Government gave\r\nthe new republic time to acquire a certain stability, and afterwards to\r\nsupport the rapid growth of the very doctrines which they had combated.\r\nA considerable number of their principles were in point of fact\r\nembodied in the political creed of their opponents; and the Federal\r\nConstitution which subsists at the present day is a lasting monument of\r\ntheir patriotism and their wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat political parties are not, then, to be met with in the United\r\nStates at the present time. Parties, indeed, may be found which\r\nthreaten the future tranquillity of the Union; but there are none which\r\nseem to contest the present form of Government or the present course of\r\nsociety. The parties by which the Union is menaced do not rest upon\r\nabstract principles, but upon temporal interests. These interests,\r\ndisseminated in the provinces of so vast an empire, may be said to\r\nconstitute rival nations rather than parties. Thus, upon a recent\r\noccasion, the North contended for the system of commercial prohibition,\r\nand the South took up arms in favor of free trade, simply because the\r\nNorth is a manufacturing and the South an agricultural district; and\r\nthat the restrictive system which was profitable to the one was\r\nprejudicial to the other. *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ [The divisions of North and South have since acquired a far greater\r\ndegree of intensity, and the South, though conquered, still presents a\r\nformidable spirit of opposition to Northern government.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nNote, 1875.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the absence of great parties, the United States abound with lesser\r\ncontroversies; and public opinion is divided into a thousand minute\r\nshades of difference upon questions of very little moment. The pains\r\nwhich are taken to create parties are inconceivable, and at the present\r\nday it is no easy task. In the United States there is no religious\r\nanimosity, because all religion is respected, and no sect is\r\npredominant; there is no jealousy of rank, because the people is\r\neverything, and none can contest its authority; lastly, there is no\r\npublic indigence to supply the means of agitation, because the physical\r\nposition of the country opens so wide a field to industry that man is\r\nable to accomplish the most surprising undertakings with his own native\r\nresources. Nevertheless, ambitious men are interested in the creation\r\nof parties, since it is difficult to eject a person from authority upon\r\nthe mere ground that his place is coveted by others. The skill of the\r\nactors in the political world lies therefore in the art of creating\r\nparties. A political aspirant in the United States begins by\r\ndiscriminating his own interest, and by calculating upon those\r\ninterests which may be collected around and amalgamated with it; he\r\nthen contrives to discover some doctrine or some principle which may\r\nsuit the purposes of this new association, and which he adopts in order\r\nto bring forward his party and to secure his popularity; just as the\r\nimprimatur of a King was in former days incorporated with the volume\r\nwhich it authorized, but to which it nowise belonged. When these\r\npreliminaries are terminated, the new party is ushered into the\r\npolitical world.\r\n\r\nAll the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a\r\nstranger to be so incomprehensible and so puerile that he is at a loss\r\nwhether to pity a people which takes such arrant trifles in good\r\nearnest, or to envy the happiness which enables it to discuss them. But\r\nwhen he comes to study the secret propensities which govern the\r\nfactions of America, he easily perceives that the greater part of them\r\nare more or less connected with one or the other of those two divisions\r\nwhich have always existed in free communities. The deeper we penetrate\r\ninto the working of these parties, the more do we perceive that the\r\nobject of the one is to limit, and that of the other to extend, the\r\npopular authority. I do not assert that the ostensible end, or even\r\nthat the secret aim, of American parties is to promote the rule of\r\naristocracy or democracy in the country; but I affirm that aristocratic\r\nor democratic passions may easily be detected at the bottom of all\r\nparties, and that, although they escape a superficial observation, they\r\nare the main point and the very soul of every faction in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo quote a recent example. When the President attacked the Bank, the\r\ncountry was excited and parties were formed; the well-informed classes\r\nrallied round the Bank, the common people round the President. But it\r\nmust not be imagined that the people had formed a rational opinion upon\r\na question which offers so many difficulties to the most experienced\r\nstatesmen. The Bank is a great establishment which enjoys an\r\nindependent existence, and the people, accustomed to make and unmake\r\nwhatsoever it pleases, is startled to meet with this obstacle to its\r\nauthority. In the midst of the perpetual fluctuation of society the\r\ncommunity is irritated by so permanent an institution, and is led to\r\nattack it in order to see whether it can be shaken and controlled, like\r\nall the other institutions of the country.\r\n\r\nRemains Of The Aristocratic Party In The United States\r\n\r\nSecret opposition of wealthy individuals to democracy\xe2\x80\x94Their\r\nretirement\xe2\x80\x94Their taste for exclusive pleasures and for luxury at\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94Their simplicity abroad\xe2\x80\x94Their affected condescension towards the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens in a people amongst which various opinions prevail\r\nthat the balance of the several parties is lost, and one of them\r\nobtains an irresistible preponderance, overpowers all obstacles,\r\nharasses its opponents, and appropriates all the resources of society\r\nto its own purposes. The vanquished citizens despair of success and\r\nthey conceal their dissatisfaction in silence and in general apathy.\r\nThe nation seems to be governed by a single principle, and the\r\nprevailing party assumes the credit of having restored peace and\r\nunanimity to the country. But this apparent unanimity is merely a cloak\r\nto alarming dissensions and perpetual opposition.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what occurred in America; when the democratic party\r\ngot the upper hand, it took exclusive possession of the conduct of\r\naffairs, and from that time the laws and the customs of society have\r\nbeen adapted to its caprices. At the present day the more affluent\r\nclasses of society are so entirely removed from the direction of\r\npolitical affairs in the United States that wealth, far from conferring\r\na right to the exercise of power, is rather an obstacle than a means of\r\nattaining to it. The wealthy members of the community abandon the\r\nlists, through unwillingness to contend, and frequently to contend in\r\nvain, against the poorest classes of their fellow citizens. They\r\nconcentrate all their enjoyments in the privacy of their homes, where\r\nthey occupy a rank which cannot be assumed in public; and they\r\nconstitute a private society in the State, which has its own tastes and\r\nits own pleasures. They submit to this state of things as an\r\nirremediable evil, but they are careful not to show that they are\r\ngalled by its continuance; it is even not uncommon to hear them laud\r\nthe delights of a republican government, and the advantages of\r\ndemocratic institutions when they are in public. Next to hating their\r\nenemies, men are most inclined to flatter them.\r\n\r\nMark, for instance, that opulent citizen, who is as anxious as a Jew of\r\nthe Middle Ages to conceal his wealth. His dress is plain, his demeanor\r\nunassuming; but the interior of his dwelling glitters with luxury, and\r\nnone but a few chosen guests whom he haughtily styles his equals are\r\nallowed to penetrate into this sanctuary. No European noble is more\r\nexclusive in his pleasures, or more jealous of the smallest advantages\r\nwhich his privileged station confers upon him. But the very same\r\nindividual crosses the city to reach a dark counting-house in the\r\ncentre of traffic, where every one may accost him who pleases. If he\r\nmeets his cobbler upon the way, they stop and converse; the two\r\ncitizens discuss the affairs of the State in which they have an equal\r\ninterest, and they shake hands before they part.\r\n\r\nBut beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequious attentions\r\nto the preponderating power, it is easy to perceive that the wealthy\r\nmembers of the community entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic\r\ninstitutions of their country. The populace is at once the object of\r\ntheir scorn and of their fears. If the maladministration of the\r\ndemocracy ever brings about a revolutionary crisis, and if monarchical\r\ninstitutions ever become practicable in the United States, the truth of\r\nwhat I advance will become obvious.\r\n\r\nThe two chief weapons which parties use in order to ensure success are\r\nthe public press and the formation of associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XI: Liberty Of The Press In The United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulty of restraining the liberty of the press\xe2\x80\x94Particular reasons\r\nwhich some nations have to cherish this liberty\xe2\x80\x94The liberty of the\r\npress a necessary consequence of the sovereignty of the people as it is\r\nunderstood in America\xe2\x80\x94Violent language of the periodical press in the\r\nUnited States\xe2\x80\x94Propensities of the periodical press\xe2\x80\x94Illustrated by the\r\nUnited States\xe2\x80\x94Opinion of the Americans upon the repression of the abuse\r\nof the liberty of the press by judicial prosecutions\xe2\x80\x94Reasons for which\r\nthe press is less powerful in America than in France.\r\n\r\nLiberty Of The Press In The United States\r\n\r\nThe influence of the liberty of the press does not affect political\r\nopinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men, and it\r\nmodifies customs as well as laws. In another part of this work I shall\r\nattempt to determinate the degree of influence which the liberty of the\r\npress has exercised upon civil society in the United States, and to\r\npoint out the direction which it has given to the ideas, as well as the\r\ntone which it has imparted to the character and the feelings, of the\r\nAnglo-Americans, but at present I purpose simply to examine the effects\r\nproduced by the liberty of the press in the political world.\r\n\r\nI confess that I do not entertain that firm and complete attachment to\r\nthe liberty of the press which things that are supremely good in their\r\nvery nature are wont to excite in the mind; and I approve of it more\r\nfrom a recollection of the evils it prevents than from a consideration\r\nof the advantages it ensures.\r\n\r\nIf any one could point out an intermediate and yet a tenable position\r\nbetween the complete independence and the entire subjection of the\r\npublic expression of opinion, I should perhaps be inclined to adopt it;\r\nbut the difficulty is to discover this position. If it is your\r\nintention to correct the abuses of unlicensed printing and to restore\r\nthe use of orderly language, you may in the first instance try the\r\noffender by a jury; but if the jury acquits him, the opinion which was\r\nthat of a single individual becomes the opinion of the country at\r\nlarge. Too much and too little has therefore hitherto been done. If you\r\nproceed, you must bring the delinquent before a court of permanent\r\njudges. But even here the cause must be heard before it can be decided;\r\nand the very principles which no book would have ventured to avow are\r\nblazoned forth in the pleadings, and what was obscurely hinted at in a\r\nsingle composition is then repeated in a multitude of other\r\npublications. The language in which a thought is embodied is the mere\r\ncarcass of the thought, and not the idea itself; tribunals may condemn\r\nthe form, but the sense and spirit of the work is too subtle for their\r\nauthority. Too much has still been done to recede, too little to attain\r\nyour end; you must therefore proceed. If you establish a censorship of\r\nthe press, the tongue of the public speaker will still make itself\r\nheard, and you have only increased the mischief. The powers of thought\r\ndo not rely, like the powers of physical strength, upon the number of\r\ntheir mechanical agents, nor can a host of authors be reckoned like the\r\ntroops which compose an army; on the contrary, the authority of a\r\nprinciple is often increased by the smallness of the number of men by\r\nwhom it is expressed. The words of a strong-minded man, which penetrate\r\namidst the passions of a listening assembly, have more power than the\r\nvociferations of a thousand orators; and if it be allowed to speak\r\nfreely in any public place, the consequence is the same as if free\r\nspeaking was allowed in every village. The liberty of discourse must\r\ntherefore be destroyed as well as the liberty of the press; this is the\r\nnecessary term of your efforts; but if your object was to repress the\r\nabuses of liberty, they have brought you to the feet of a despot. You\r\nhave been led from the extreme of independence to the extreme of\r\nsubjection without meeting with a single tenable position for shelter\r\nor repose.\r\n\r\nThere are certain nations which have peculiar reasons for cherishing\r\nthe liberty of the press, independently of the general motives which I\r\nhave just pointed out. For in certain countries which profess to enjoy\r\nthe privileges of freedom every individual agent of the Government may\r\nviolate the laws with impunity, since those whom he oppresses cannot\r\nprosecute him before the courts of justice. In this case the liberty of\r\nthe press is not merely a guarantee, but it is the only guarantee, of\r\ntheir liberty and their security which the citizens possess. If the\r\nrulers of these nations propose to abolish the independence of the\r\npress, the people would be justified in saying: Give us the right of\r\nprosecuting your offences before the ordinary tribunals, and perhaps we\r\nmay then waive our right of appeal to the tribunal of public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut in the countries in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople ostensibly prevails, the censorship of the press is not only\r\ndangerous, but it is absurd. When the right of every citizen to\r\nco-operate in the government of society is acknowledged, every citizen\r\nmust be presumed to possess the power of discriminating between the\r\ndifferent opinions of his contemporaries, and of appreciating the\r\ndifferent facts from which inferences may be drawn. The sovereignty of\r\nthe people and the liberty of the press may therefore be looked upon as\r\ncorrelative institutions; just as the censorship of the press and\r\nuniversal suffrage are two things which are irreconcilably opposed, and\r\nwhich cannot long be retained among the institutions of the same\r\npeople. Not a single individual of the twelve millions who inhabit the\r\nterritory of the United States has as yet dared to propose any\r\nrestrictions to the liberty of the press. The first newspaper over\r\nwhich I cast my eyes, upon my arrival in America, contained the\r\nfollowing article:\r\n\r\nIn all this affair the language of Jackson has been that of a heartless\r\ndespot, solely occupied with the preservation of his own authority.\r\nAmbition is his crime, and it will be his punishment too: intrigue is\r\nhis native element, and intrigue will confound his tricks, and will\r\ndeprive him of his power: he governs by means of corruption, and his\r\nimmoral practices will redound to his shame and confusion. His conduct\r\nin the political arena has been that of a shameless and lawless\r\ngamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of retribution\r\napproaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to throw\r\naside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement, where he\r\nmay curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a virtue with\r\nwhich his heart is likely to remain forever unacquainted.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommonly imagined in France that the virulence of the press\r\noriginates in the uncertain social condition, in the political\r\nexcitement, and the general sense of consequent evil which prevail in\r\nthat country; and it is therefore supposed that as soon as society has\r\nresumed a certain degree of composure the press will abandon its\r\npresent vehemence. I am inclined to think that the above causes explain\r\nthe reason of the extraordinary ascendency it has acquired over the\r\nnation, but that they do not exercise much influence upon the tone of\r\nits language. The periodical press appears to me to be actuated by\r\npassions and propensities independent of the circumstances in which it\r\nis placed, and the present position of America corroborates this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nAmerica is perhaps, at this moment, the country of the whole world\r\nwhich contains the fewest germs of revolution; but the press is not\r\nless destructive in its principles than in France, and it displays the\r\nsame violence without the same reasons for indignation. In America, as\r\nin France, it constitutes a singular power, so strangely composed of\r\nmingled good and evil that it is at the same time indispensable to the\r\nexistence of freedom, and nearly incompatible with the maintenance of\r\npublic order. Its power is certainly much greater in France than in the\r\nUnited States; though nothing is more rare in the latter country than\r\nto hear of a prosecution having been instituted against it. The reason\r\nof this is perfectly simple: the Americans, having once admitted the\r\ndoctrine of the sovereignty of the people, apply it with perfect\r\nconsistency. It was never their intention to found a permanent state of\r\nthings with elements which undergo daily modifications; and there is\r\nconsequently nothing criminal in an attack upon the existing laws,\r\nprovided it be not attended with a violent infraction of them. They are\r\nmoreover of opinion that courts of justice are unable to check the\r\nabuses of the press; and that as the subtilty of human language\r\nperpetually eludes the severity of judicial analysis, offences of this\r\nnature are apt to escape the hand which attempts to apprehend them.\r\nThey hold that to act with efficacy upon the press it would be\r\nnecessary to find a tribunal, not only devoted to the existing order of\r\nthings, but capable of surmounting the influence of public opinion; a\r\ntribunal which should conduct its proceedings without publicity, which\r\nshould pronounce its decrees without assigning its motives, and punish\r\nthe intentions even more than the language of an author. Whosoever\r\nshould have the power of creating and maintaining a tribunal of this\r\nkind would waste his time in prosecuting the liberty of the press; for\r\nhe would be the supreme master of the whole community, and he would be\r\nas free to rid himself of the authors as of their writings. In this\r\nquestion, therefore, there is no medium between servitude and extreme\r\nlicense; in order to enjoy the inestimable benefits which the liberty\r\nof the press ensures, it is necessary to submit to the inevitable evils\r\nwhich it engenders. To expect to acquire the former and to escape the\r\nlatter is to cherish one of those illusions which commonly mislead\r\nnations in their times of sickness, when, tired with faction and\r\nexhausted by effort, they attempt to combine hostile opinions and\r\ncontrary principles upon the same soil.\r\n\r\nThe small influence of the American journals is attributable to several\r\nreasons, amongst which are the following:\r\n\r\nThe liberty of writing, like all other liberty, is most formidable when\r\nit is a novelty; for a people which has never been accustomed to\r\nco-operate in the conduct of State affairs places implicit confidence\r\nin the first tribune who arouses its attention. The Anglo-Americans\r\nhave enjoyed this liberty ever since the foundation of the settlements;\r\nmoreover, the press cannot create human passions by its own power,\r\nhowever skillfully it may kindle them where they exist. In America\r\npolitics are discussed with animation and a varied activity, but they\r\nrarely touch those deep passions which are excited whenever the\r\npositive interest of a part of the community is impaired: but in the\r\nUnited States the interests of the community are in a most prosperous\r\ncondition. A single glance upon a French and an American newspaper is\r\nsufficient to show the difference which exists between the two nations\r\non this head. In France the space allotted to commercial advertisements\r\nis very limited, and the intelligence is not considerable, but the most\r\nessential part of the journal is that which contains the discussion of\r\nthe politics of the day. In America three-quarters of the enormous\r\nsheet which is set before the reader are filled with advertisements,\r\nand the remainder is frequently occupied by political intelligence or\r\ntrivial anecdotes: it is only from time to time that one finds a corner\r\ndevoted to passionate discussions like those with which the journalists\r\nof France are wont to indulge their readers.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated by observation, and discovered by the innate\r\nsagacity of the pettiest as well as the greatest of despots, that the\r\ninfluence of a power is increased in proportion as its direction is\r\nrendered more central. In France the press combines a twofold\r\ncentralization; almost all its power is centred in the same spot, and\r\nvested in the same hands, for its organs are far from numerous. The\r\ninfluence of a public press thus constituted, upon a sceptical nation,\r\nmust be unbounded. It is an enemy with which a Government may sign an\r\noccasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNeither of these kinds of centralization exists in America. The United\r\nStates have no metropolis; the intelligence as well as the power of the\r\ncountry are dispersed abroad, and instead of radiating from a point,\r\nthey cross each other in every direction; the Americans have\r\nestablished no central control over the expression of opinion, any more\r\nthan over the conduct of business. These are circumstances which do not\r\ndepend on human foresight; but it is owing to the laws of the Union\r\nthat there are no licenses to be granted to printers, no securities\r\ndemanded from editors as in France, and no stamp duty as in France and\r\nformerly in England. The consequence of this is that nothing is easier\r\nthan to set up a newspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to\r\ndefray the expenses of the editor.\r\n\r\nThe number of periodical and occasional publications which appears in\r\nthe United States actually surpasses belief. The most enlightened\r\nAmericans attribute the subordinate influence of the press to this\r\nexcessive dissemination; and it is adopted as an axiom of political\r\nscience in that country that the only way to neutralize the effect of\r\npublic journals is to multiply them indefinitely. I cannot conceive\r\nthat a truth which is so self-evident should not already have been more\r\ngenerally admitted in Europe; it is comprehensible that the persons who\r\nhope to bring about revolutions by means of the press should be\r\ndesirous of confining its action to a few powerful organs, but it is\r\nperfectly incredible that the partisans of the existing state of\r\nthings, and the natural supporters of the law, should attempt to\r\ndiminish the influence of the press by concentrating its authority. The\r\nGovernments of Europe seem to treat the press with the courtesy of the\r\nknights of old; they are anxious to furnish it with the same central\r\npower which they have found to be so trusty a weapon, in order to\r\nenhance the glory of their resistance to its attacks.\r\n\r\nIn America there is scarcely a hamlet which has not its own newspaper.\r\nIt may readily be imagined that neither discipline nor unity of design\r\ncan be communicated to so multifarious a host, and each one is\r\nconsequently led to fight under his own standard. All the political\r\njournals of the United States are indeed arrayed on the side of the\r\nadministration or against it; but they attack and defend in a thousand\r\ndifferent ways. They cannot succeed in forming those great currents of\r\nopinion which overwhelm the most solid obstacles. This division of the\r\ninfluence of the press produces a variety of other consequences which\r\nare scarcely less remarkable. The facility with which journals can be\r\nestablished induces a multitude of individuals to take a part in them;\r\nbut as the extent of competition precludes the possibility of\r\nconsiderable profit, the most distinguished classes of society are\r\nrarely led to engage in these undertakings. But such is the number of\r\nthe public prints that, even if they were a source of wealth, writers\r\nof ability could not be found to direct them all. The journalists of\r\nthe United States are usually placed in a very humble position, with a\r\nscanty education and a vulgar turn of mind. The will of the majority is\r\nthe most general of laws, and it establishes certain habits which form\r\nthe characteristics of each peculiar class of society; thus it dictates\r\nthe etiquette practised at courts and the etiquette of the bar. The\r\ncharacteristics of the French journalist consist in a violent, but\r\nfrequently an eloquent and lofty, manner of discussing the politics of\r\nthe day; and the exceptions to this habitual practice are only\r\noccasional. The characteristics of the American journalist consist in\r\nan open and coarse appeal to the passions of the populace; and he\r\nhabitually abandons the principles of political science to assail the\r\ncharacters of individuals, to track them into private life, and\r\ndisclose all their weaknesses and errors.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more deplorable than this abuse of the powers of\r\nthought; I shall have occasion to point out hereafter the influence of\r\nthe newspapers upon the taste and the morality of the American people,\r\nbut my present subject exclusively concerns the political world. It\r\ncannot be denied that the effects of this extreme license of the press\r\ntend indirectly to the maintenance of public order. The individuals who\r\nare already in the possession of a high station in the esteem of their\r\nfellow-citizens are afraid to write in the newspapers, and they are\r\nthus deprived of the most powerful instrument which they can use to\r\nexcite the passions of the multitude to their own advantage. *a\r\n\r\na\r\n[ They only write in the papers when they choose to address the people\r\nin their own name; as, for instance, when they are called upon to repel\r\ncalumnious imputations, and to correct a misstatement of facts.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal opinions of the editors have no kind of weight in the eyes\r\nof the public: the only use of a journal is, that it imparts the\r\nknowledge of certain facts, and it is only by altering or distorting\r\nthose facts that a journalist can contribute to the support of his own\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nBut although the press is limited to these resources, its influence in\r\nAmerica is immense. It is the power which impels the circulation of\r\npolitical life through all the districts of that vast territory. Its\r\neye is constantly open to detect the secret springs of political\r\ndesigns, and to summon the leaders of all parties to the bar of public\r\nopinion. It rallies the interests of the community round certain\r\nprinciples, and it draws up the creed which factions adopt; for it\r\naffords a means of intercourse between parties which hear, and which\r\naddress each other without ever having been in immediate contact. When\r\na great number of the organs of the press adopt the same line of\r\nconduct, their influence becomes irresistible; and public opinion, when\r\nit is perpetually assailed from the same side, eventually yields to the\r\nattack. In the United States each separate journal exercises but little\r\nauthority, but the power of the periodical press is only second to that\r\nof the people. *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ See Appendix, P.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinions established in the United States under the empire of the\r\nliberty of the press are frequently more firmly rooted than those which\r\nare formed elsewhere under the sanction of a censor.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the democracy perpetually raises fresh individuals\r\nto the conduct of public affairs; and the measures of the\r\nadministration are consequently seldom regulated by the strict rules of\r\nconsistency or of order. But the general principles of the Government\r\nare more stable, and the opinions most prevalent in society are\r\ngenerally more durable than in many other countries. When once the\r\nAmericans have taken up an idea, whether it be well or ill founded,\r\nnothing is more difficult than to eradicate it from their minds. The\r\nsame tenacity of opinion has been observed in England, where, for the\r\nlast century, greater freedom of conscience and more invincible\r\nprejudices have existed than in all the other countries of Europe. I\r\nattribute this consequence to a cause which may at first sight appear\r\nto have a very opposite tendency, namely, to the liberty of the press.\r\nThe nations amongst which this liberty exists are as apt to cling to\r\ntheir opinions from pride as from conviction. They cherish them because\r\nthey hold them to be just, and because they exercised their own\r\nfree-will in choosing them; and they maintain them not only because\r\nthey are true, but because they are their own. Several other reasons\r\nconduce to the same end.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by a man of genius that \xe2\x80\x9cignorance lies at the two ends\r\nof knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps it would have been more correct to have said,\r\nthat absolute convictions are to be met with at the two extremities,\r\nand that doubt lies in the middle; for the human intellect may be\r\nconsidered in three distinct states, which frequently succeed one\r\nanother. A man believes implicitly, because he adopts a proposition\r\nwithout inquiry. He doubts as soon as he is assailed by the objections\r\nwhich his inquiries may have aroused. But he frequently succeeds in\r\nsatisfying these doubts, and then he begins to believe afresh: he no\r\nlonger lays hold on a truth in its most shadowy and uncertain form, but\r\nhe sees it clearly before him, and he advances onwards by the light it\r\ngives him. *c\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ It may, however, be doubted whether this rational and self-guiding\r\nconviction arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic devotedness in men as\r\ntheir first dogmatical belief.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the liberty of the press acts upon men who are in the first of\r\nthese three states, it does not immediately disturb their habit of\r\nbelieving implicitly without investigation, but it constantly modifies\r\nthe objects of their intuitive convictions. The human mind continues to\r\ndiscern but one point upon the whole intellectual horizon, and that\r\npoint is in continual motion. Such are the symptoms of sudden\r\nrevolutions, and of the misfortunes which are sure to befall those\r\ngenerations which abruptly adopt the unconditional freedom of the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nThe circle of novel ideas is, however, soon terminated; the touch of\r\nexperience is upon them, and the doubt and mistrust which their\r\nuncertainty produces become universal. We may rest assured that the\r\nmajority of mankind will either believe they know not wherefore, or\r\nwill not know what to believe. Few are the beings who can ever hope to\r\nattain to that state of rational and independent conviction which true\r\nknowledge can beget in defiance of the attacks of doubt.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that in times of great religious fervor men\r\nsometimes change their religious opinions; whereas in times of general\r\nscepticism everyone clings to his own persuasion. The same thing takes\r\nplace in politics under the liberty of the press. In countries where\r\nall the theories of social science have been contested in their turn,\r\nthe citizens who have adopted one of them stick to it, not so much\r\nbecause they are assured of its excellence, as because they are not\r\nconvinced of the superiority of any other. In the present age men are\r\nnot very ready to die in defence of their opinions, but they are rarely\r\ninclined to change them; and there are fewer martyrs as well as fewer\r\napostates.\r\n\r\nAnother still more valid reason may yet be adduced: when no abstract\r\nopinions are looked upon as certain, men cling to the mere propensities\r\nand external interests of their position, which are naturally more\r\ntangible and more permanent than any opinions in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question of easy solution whether aristocracy or democracy\r\nis most fit to govern a country. But it is certain that democracy\r\nannoys one part of the community, and that aristocracy oppresses\r\nanother part. When the question is reduced to the simple expression of\r\nthe struggle between poverty and wealth, the tendency of each side of\r\nthe dispute becomes perfectly evident without further controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XII: Political Associations In The United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily use which the Anglo-Americans make of the right of\r\nassociation\xe2\x80\x94Three kinds of political associations\xe2\x80\x94In what manner the\r\nAmericans apply the representative system to associations\xe2\x80\x94Dangers\r\nresulting to the State\xe2\x80\x94Great Convention of 1831 relative to the\r\nTariff\xe2\x80\x94Legislative character of this Convention\xe2\x80\x94Why the unlimited\r\nexercise of the right of association is less dangerous in the United\r\nStates than elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94Why it may be looked upon as necessary\xe2\x80\x94Utility of\r\nassociations in a democratic people.\r\n\r\nPolitical Associations In The United States\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world has the principle of association been more\r\nsuccessfully used, or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of\r\ndifferent objects, than in America. Besides the permanent associations\r\nwhich are established by law under the names of townships, cities, and\r\ncounties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the\r\nagency of private individuals.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of the United States is taught from his earliest infancy to\r\nrely upon his own exertions in order to resist the evils and the\r\ndifficulties of life; he looks upon social authority with an eye of\r\nmistrust and anxiety, and he only claims its assistance when he is\r\nquite unable to shift without it. This habit may even be traced in the\r\nschools of the rising generation, where the children in their games are\r\nwont to submit to rules which they have themselves established, and to\r\npunish misdemeanors which they have themselves defined. The same spirit\r\npervades every act of social life. If a stoppage occurs in a\r\nthoroughfare, and the circulation of the public is hindered, the\r\nneighbors immediately constitute a deliberative body; and this\r\nextemporaneous assembly gives rise to an executive power which remedies\r\nthe inconvenience before anybody has thought of recurring to an\r\nauthority superior to that of the persons immediately concerned. If the\r\npublic pleasures are concerned, an association is formed to provide for\r\nthe splendor and the regularity of the entertainment. Societies are\r\nformed to resist enemies which are exclusively of a moral nature, and\r\nto diminish the vice of intemperance: in the United States associations\r\nare established to promote public order, commerce, industry, morality,\r\nand religion; for there is no end which the human will, seconded by the\r\ncollective exertions of individuals, despairs of attaining.\r\n\r\nI shall hereafter have occasion to show the effects of association upon\r\nthe course of society, and I must confine myself for the present to the\r\npolitical world. When once the right of association is recognized, the\r\ncitizens may employ it in several different ways.\r\n\r\nAn association consists simply in the public assent which a number of\r\nindividuals give to certain doctrines, and in the engagement which they\r\ncontract to promote the spread of those doctrines by their exertions.\r\nThe right of association with these views is very analogous to the\r\nliberty of unlicensed writing; but societies thus formed possess more\r\nauthority than the press. When an opinion is represented by a society,\r\nit necessarily assumes a more exact and explicit form. It numbers its\r\npartisans, and compromises their welfare in its cause: they, on the\r\nother hand, become acquainted with each other, and their zeal is\r\nincreased by their number. An association unites the efforts of minds\r\nwhich have a tendency to diverge in one single channel, and urges them\r\nvigorously towards one single end which it points out.\r\n\r\nThe second degree in the right of association is the power of meeting.\r\nWhen an association is allowed to establish centres of action at\r\ncertain important points in the country, its activity is increased and\r\nits influence extended. Men have the opportunity of seeing each other;\r\nmeans of execution are more readily combined, and opinions are\r\nmaintained with a degree of warmth and energy which written language\r\ncannot approach.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the exercise of the right of political association, there is\r\na third degree: the partisans of an opinion may unite in electoral\r\nbodies, and choose delegates to represent them in a central assembly.\r\nThis is, properly speaking, the application of the representative\r\nsystem to a party.\r\n\r\nThus, in the first instance, a society is formed between individuals\r\nprofessing the same opinion, and the tie which keeps it together is of\r\na purely intellectual nature; in the second case, small assemblies are\r\nformed which only represent a fraction of the party. Lastly, in the\r\nthird case, they constitute a separate nation in the midst of the\r\nnation, a government within the Government. Their delegates, like the\r\nreal delegates of the majority, represent the entire collective force\r\nof their party; and they enjoy a certain degree of that national\r\ndignity and great influence which belong to the chosen representatives\r\nof the people. It is true that they have not the right of making the\r\nlaws, but they have the power of attacking those which are in being,\r\nand of drawing up beforehand those which they may afterwards cause to\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nIf, in a people which is imperfectly accustomed to the exercise of\r\nfreedom, or which is exposed to violent political passions, a\r\ndeliberating minority, which confines itself to the contemplation of\r\nfuture laws, be placed in juxtaposition to the legislative majority, I\r\ncannot but believe that public tranquillity incurs very great risks in\r\nthat nation. There is doubtless a very wide difference between proving\r\nthat one law is in itself better than another and proving that the\r\nformer ought to be substituted for the latter. But the imagination of\r\nthe populace is very apt to overlook this difference, which is so\r\napparent to the minds of thinking men. It sometimes happens that a\r\nnation is divided into two nearly equal parties, each of which affects\r\nto represent the majority. If, in immediate contiguity to the directing\r\npower, another power be established, which exercises almost as much\r\nmoral authority as the former, it is not to be believed that it will\r\nlong be content to speak without acting; or that it will always be\r\nrestrained by the abstract consideration of the nature of associations\r\nwhich are meant to direct but not to enforce opinions, to suggest but\r\nnot to make the laws.\r\n\r\nThe more we consider the independence of the press in its principal\r\nconsequences, the more are we convinced that it is the chief and, so to\r\nspeak, the constitutive element of freedom in the modern world. A\r\nnation which is determined to remain free is therefore right in\r\ndemanding the unrestrained exercise of this independence. But the\r\nunrestrained liberty of political association cannot be entirely\r\nassimilated to the liberty of the press. The one is at the same time\r\nless necessary and more dangerous than the other. A nation may confine\r\nit within certain limits without forfeiting any part of its\r\nself-control; and it may sometimes be obliged to do so in order to\r\nmaintain its own authority.\r\n\r\nIn America the liberty of association for political purposes is\r\nunbounded. An example will show in the clearest light to what an extent\r\nthis privilege is tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe question of the tariff, or of free trade, produced a great\r\nmanifestation of party feeling in America; the tariff was not only a\r\nsubject of debate as a matter of opinion, but it exercised a favorable\r\nor a prejudicial influence upon several very powerful interests of the\r\nStates. The North attributed a great portion of its prosperity, and the\r\nSouth all its sufferings, to this system; insomuch that for a long time\r\nthe tariff was the sole source of the political animosities which\r\nagitated the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, when the dispute was raging with the utmost virulence, a\r\nprivate citizen of Massachusetts proposed to all the enemies of the\r\ntariff, by means of the public prints, to send delegates to\r\nPhiladelphia in order to consult together upon the means which were\r\nmost fitted to promote freedom of trade. This proposal circulated in a\r\nfew days from Maine to New Orleans by the power of the printing-press:\r\nthe opponents of the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm; meetings were\r\nformed on all sides, and delegates were named. The majority of these\r\nindividuals were well known, and some of them had earned a considerable\r\ndegree of celebrity. South Carolina alone, which afterwards took up\r\narms in the same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On October 1, 1831,\r\nthis assembly, which according to the American custom had taken the\r\nname of a Convention, met at Philadelphia; it consisted of more than\r\ntwo hundred members. Its debates were public, and they at once assumed\r\na legislative character; the extent of the powers of Congress, the\r\ntheories of free trade, and the different clauses of the tariff, were\r\ndiscussed in turn. At the end of ten days\xe2\x80\x99 deliberation the Convention\r\nbroke up, after having published an address to the American people, in\r\nwhich it declared:\r\n\r\nI. That Congress had not the right of making a tariff, and that the\r\nexisting tariff was unconstitutional;\r\n\r\nII. That the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the interests\r\nof all nations, and to that of the American people in particular.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of political\r\nassociation has not hitherto produced, in the United States, those\r\nfatal consequences which might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere.\r\nThe right of association was imported from England, and it has always\r\nexisted in America; so that the exercise of this privilege is now\r\namalgamated with the manners and customs of the people. At the present\r\ntime the liberty of association is become a necessary guarantee against\r\nthe tyranny of the majority. In the United States, as soon as a party\r\nis become preponderant, all public authority passes under its control;\r\nits private supporters occupy all the places, and have all the force of\r\nthe administration at their disposal. As the most distinguished\r\npartisans of the other side of the question are unable to surmount the\r\nobstacles which exclude them from power, they require some means of\r\nestablishing themselves upon their own basis, and of opposing the moral\r\nauthority of the minority to the physical power which domineers over\r\nit. Thus a dangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more\r\nformidable danger.\r\n\r\nThe omnipotence of the majority appears to me to present such extreme\r\nperils to the American Republics that the dangerous measure which is\r\nused to repress it seems to be more advantageous than prejudicial. And\r\nhere I am about to advance a proposition which may remind the reader of\r\nwhat I said before in speaking of municipal freedom: There are no\r\ncountries in which associations are more needed, to prevent the\r\ndespotism of faction or the arbitrary power of a prince, than those\r\nwhich are democratically constituted. In aristocratic nations the body\r\nof the nobles and the more opulent part of the community are in\r\nthemselves natural associations, which act as checks upon the abuses of\r\npower. In countries in which these associations do not exist, if\r\nprivate individuals are unable to create an artificial and a temporary\r\nsubstitute for them, I can imagine no permanent protection against the\r\nmost galling tyranny; and a great people may be oppressed by a small\r\nfaction, or by a single individual, with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of a great political Convention (for there are Conventions\r\nof all kinds), which may frequently become a necessary measure, is\r\nalways a serious occurrence, even in America, and one which is never\r\nlooked forward to, by the judicious friends of the country, without\r\nalarm. This was very perceptible in the Convention of 1831, at which\r\nthe exertions of all the most distinguished members of the Assembly\r\ntended to moderate its language, and to restrain the subjects which it\r\ntreated within certain limits. It is probable, in fact, that the\r\nConvention of 1831 exercised a very great influence upon the minds of\r\nthe malcontents, and prepared them for the open revolt against the\r\ncommercial laws of the Union which took place in 1832.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association for\r\npolitical purposes is the privilege which a people is longest in\r\nlearning how to exercise. If it does not throw the nation into anarchy,\r\nit perpetually augments the chances of that calamity. On one point,\r\nhowever, this perilous liberty offers a security against dangers of\r\nanother kind; in countries where associations are free, secret\r\nsocieties are unknown. In America there are numerous factions, but no\r\nconspiracies.\r\n\r\nDifferent ways in which the right of association is understood in\r\nEurope and in the United States\xe2\x80\x94Different use which is made of it.\r\n\r\nThe most natural privilege of man, next to the right of acting for\r\nhimself, is that of combining his exertions with those of his\r\nfellow-creatures, and of acting in common with them. I am therefore led\r\nto conclude that the right of association is almost as inalienable as\r\nthe right of personal liberty. No legislator can attack it without\r\nimpairing the very foundations of society. Nevertheless, if the liberty\r\nof association is a fruitful source of advantages and prosperity to\r\nsome nations, it may be perverted or carried to excess by others, and\r\nthe element of life may be changed into an element of destruction. A\r\ncomparison of the different methods which associations pursue in those\r\ncountries in which they are managed with discretion, as well as in\r\nthose where liberty degenerates into license, may perhaps be thought\r\nuseful both to governments and to parties.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Europeans look upon an association as a weapon\r\nwhich is to be hastily fashioned, and immediately tried in the\r\nconflict. A society is formed for discussion, but the idea of impending\r\naction prevails in the minds of those who constitute it: it is, in\r\nfact, an army; and the time given to parley serves to reckon up the\r\nstrength and to animate the courage of the host, after which they\r\ndirect their march against the enemy. Resources which lie within the\r\nbounds of the law may suggest themselves to the persons who compose it\r\nas means, but never as the only means, of success.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, is not the manner in which the right of association is\r\nunderstood in the United States. In America the citizens who form the\r\nminority associate, in order, in the first place, to show their\r\nnumerical strength, and so to diminish the moral authority of the\r\nmajority; and, in the second place, to stimulate competition, and to\r\ndiscover those arguments which are most fitted to act upon the\r\nmajority; for they always entertain hopes of drawing over their\r\nopponents to their own side, and of afterwards disposing of the supreme\r\npower in their name. Political associations in the United States are\r\ntherefore peaceable in their intentions, and strictly legal in the\r\nmeans which they employ; and they assert with perfect truth that they\r\nonly aim at success by lawful expedients.\r\n\r\nThe difference which exists between the Americans and ourselves depends\r\non several causes. In Europe there are numerous parties so\r\ndiametrically opposed to the majority that they can never hope to\r\nacquire its support, and at the same time they think that they are\r\nsufficiently strong in themselves to struggle and to defend their\r\ncause. When a party of this kind forms an association, its object is,\r\nnot to conquer, but to fight. In America the individuals who hold\r\nopinions very much opposed to those of the majority are no sort of\r\nimpediment to its power, and all other parties hope to win it over to\r\ntheir own principles in the end. The exercise of the right of\r\nassociation becomes dangerous in proportion to the impossibility which\r\nexcludes great parties from acquiring the majority. In a country like\r\nthe United States, in which the differences of opinion are mere\r\ndifferences of hue, the right of association may remain unrestrained\r\nwithout evil consequences. The inexperience of many of the European\r\nnations in the enjoyment of liberty leads them only to look upon the\r\nliberty of association as a right of attacking the Government. The\r\nfirst notion which presents itself to a party, as well as to an\r\nindividual, when it has acquired a consciousness of its own strength,\r\nis that of violence: the notion of persuasion arises at a later period\r\nand is only derived from experience. The English, who are divided into\r\nparties which differ most essentially from each other, rarely abuse the\r\nright of association, because they have long been accustomed to\r\nexercise it. In France the passion for war is so intense that there is\r\nno undertaking so mad, or so injurious to the welfare of the State,\r\nthat a man does not consider himself honored in defending it, at the\r\nrisk of his life.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most powerful of the causes which tend to mitigate the\r\nexcesses of political association in the United States is Universal\r\nSuffrage. In countries in which universal suffrage exists the majority\r\nis never doubtful, because neither party can pretend to represent that\r\nportion of the community which has not voted. The associations which\r\nare formed are aware, as well as the nation at large, that they do not\r\nrepresent the majority: this is, indeed, a condition inseparable from\r\ntheir existence; for if they did represent the preponderating power,\r\nthey would change the law instead of soliciting its reform. The\r\nconsequence of this is that the moral influence of the Government which\r\nthey attack is very much increased, and their own power is very much\r\nenfeebled.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there are few associations which do not affect to represent\r\nthe majority, or which do not believe that they represent it. This\r\nconviction or this pretension tends to augment their force amazingly,\r\nand contributes no less to legalize their measures. Violence may seem\r\nto be excusable in defence of the cause of oppressed right. Thus it is,\r\nin the vast labyrinth of human laws, that extreme liberty sometimes\r\ncorrects the abuses of license, and that extreme democracy obviates the\r\ndangers of democratic government. In Europe, associations consider\r\nthemselves, in some degree, as the legislative and executive councils\r\nof the people, which is unable to speak for itself. In America, where\r\nthey only represent a minority of the nation, they argue and they\r\npetition.\r\n\r\nThe means which the associations of Europe employ are in accordance\r\nwith the end which they propose to obtain. As the principal aim of\r\nthese bodies is to act, and not to debate, to fight rather than to\r\npersuade, they are naturally led to adopt a form of organization which\r\ndiffers from the ordinary customs of civil bodies, and which assumes\r\nthe habits and the maxims of military life. They centralize the\r\ndirection of their resources as much as possible, and they intrust the\r\npower of the whole party to a very small number of leaders.\r\n\r\nThe members of these associations respond to a watchword, like soldiers\r\non duty; they profess the doctrine of passive obedience; say rather,\r\nthat in uniting together they at once abjure the exercise of their own\r\njudgment and free will; and the tyrannical control which these\r\nsocieties exercise is often far more insupportable than the authority\r\npossessed over society by the Government which they attack. Their moral\r\nforce is much diminished by these excesses, and they lose the powerful\r\ninterest which is always excited by a struggle between oppressors and\r\nthe oppressed. The man who in given cases consents to obey his fellows\r\nwith servility, and who submits his activity and even his opinions to\r\ntheir control, can have no claim to rank as a free citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have also established certain forms of government which\r\nare applied to their associations, but these are invariably borrowed\r\nfrom the forms of the civil administration. The independence of each\r\nindividual is formally recognized; the tendency of the members of the\r\nassociation points, as it does in the body of the community, towards\r\nthe same end, but they are not obliged to follow the same track. No one\r\nabjures the exercise of his reason and his free will; but every one\r\nexerts that reason and that will for the benefit of a common\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XIII: Government Of The Democracy In America\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of my\r\nsubject, but although every expression which I am about to make use of\r\nmay clash, upon some one point, with the feelings of the different\r\nparties which divide my country, I shall speak my opinion with the most\r\nperfect openness.\r\n\r\nIn Europe we are at a loss how to judge the true character and the more\r\npermanent propensities of democracy, because in Europe two conflicting\r\nprinciples exist, and we do not know what to attribute to the\r\nprinciples themselves, and what to refer to the passions which they\r\nbring into collision. Such, however, is not the case in America; there\r\nthe people reigns without any obstacle, and it has no perils to dread\r\nand no injuries to avenge. In America, democracy is swayed by its own\r\nfree propensities; its course is natural and its activity is\r\nunrestrained; the United States consequently afford the most favorable\r\nopportunity of studying its real character. And to no people can this\r\ninquiry be more vitally interesting than to the French nation, which is\r\nblindly driven onwards by a daily and irresistible impulse towards a\r\nstate of things which may prove either despotic or republican, but\r\nwhich will assuredly be democratic.\r\n\r\nUniversal Suffrage\r\n\r\nI have already observed that universal suffrage has been adopted in all\r\nthe States of the Union; it consequently occurs amongst different\r\npopulations which occupy very different positions in the scale of\r\nsociety. I have had opportunities of observing its effects in different\r\nlocalities, and amongst races of men who are nearly strangers to each\r\nother by their language, their religion, and their manner of life; in\r\nLouisiana as well as in New England, in Georgia and in Canada. I have\r\nremarked that Universal Suffrage is far from producing in America\r\neither all the good or all the evil consequences which are assigned to\r\nit in Europe, and that its effects differ very widely from those which\r\nare usually attributed to it.\r\n\r\nChoice Of The People, And Instinctive Preferences Of The American\r\nDemocracy\r\n\r\nIn the United States the most able men are rarely placed at the head of\r\naffairs\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this peculiarity\xe2\x80\x94The envy which prevails in the lower\r\norders of France against the higher classes is not a French, but a\r\npurely democratic sentiment\xe2\x80\x94For what reason the most distinguished men\r\nin America frequently seclude themselves from public affairs.\r\n\r\nMany people in Europe are apt to believe without saying it, or to say\r\nwithout believing it, that one of the great advantages of universal\r\nsuffrage is, that it entrusts the direction of public affairs to men\r\nwho are worthy of the public confidence. They admit that the people is\r\nunable to govern for itself, but they aver that it is always sincerely\r\ndisposed to promote the welfare of the State, and that it instinctively\r\ndesignates those persons who are animated by the same good wishes, and\r\nwho are the most fit to wield the supreme authority. I confess that the\r\nobservations I made in America by no means coincide with these\r\nopinions. On my arrival in the United States I was surprised to find so\r\nmuch distinguished talent among the subjects, and so little among the\r\nheads of the Government. It is a well-authenticated fact, that at the\r\npresent day the most able men in the United States are very rarely\r\nplaced at the head of affairs; and it must be acknowledged that such\r\nhas been the result in proportion as democracy has outstepped all its\r\nformer limits. The race of American statesmen has evidently dwindled\r\nmost remarkably in the course of the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes may be assigned to this phenomenon. It is impossible,\r\nnotwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, to raise the intelligence\r\nof the people above a certain level. Whatever may be the facilities of\r\nacquiring information, whatever may be the profusion of easy methods\r\nand of cheap science, the human mind can never be instructed and\r\neducated without devoting a considerable space of time to those\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThe greater or the lesser possibility of subsisting without labor is\r\ntherefore the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement. This\r\nboundary is more remote in some countries and more restricted in\r\nothers; but it must exist somewhere as long as the people is\r\nconstrained to work in order to procure the means of physical\r\nsubsistence, that is to say, as long as it retains its popular\r\ncharacter. It is therefore quite as difficult to imagine a State in\r\nwhich all the citizens should be very well informed as a State in which\r\nthey should all be wealthy; these two difficulties may be looked upon\r\nas correlative. It may very readily be admitted that the mass of the\r\ncitizens are sincerely disposed to promote the welfare of their\r\ncountry; nay more, it may even be allowed that the lower classes are\r\nless apt to be swayed by considerations of personal interest than the\r\nhigher orders: but it is always more or less impossible for them to\r\ndiscern the best means of attaining the end which they desire with\r\nsincerity. Long and patient observation, joined to a multitude of\r\ndifferent notions, is required to form a just estimate of the character\r\nof a single individual; and can it be supposed that the vulgar have the\r\npower of succeeding in an inquiry which misleads the penetration of\r\ngenius itself? The people has neither the time nor the means which are\r\nessential to the prosecution of an investigation of this kind: its\r\nconclusions are hastily formed from a superficial inspection of the\r\nmore prominent features of a question. Hence it often assents to the\r\nclamor of a mountebank who knows the secret of stimulating its tastes,\r\nwhile its truest friends frequently fail in their exertions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the democracy is not only deficient in that soundness of\r\njudgment which is necessary to select men really deserving of its\r\nconfidence, but it has neither the desire nor the inclination to find\r\nthem out. It cannot be denied that democratic institutions have a very\r\nstrong tendency to promote the feeling of envy in the human heart; not\r\nso much because they afford to every one the means of rising to the\r\nlevel of any of his fellow-citizens, as because those means perpetually\r\ndisappoint the persons who employ them. Democratic institutions awaken\r\nand foster a passion for equality which they can never entirely\r\nsatisfy. This complete equality eludes the grasp of the people at the\r\nvery moment at which it thinks to hold it fast, and \xe2\x80\x9cflies,\xe2\x80\x9d as Pascal\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cwith eternal flight\xe2\x80\x9d; the people is excited in the pursuit of an\r\nadvantage, which is more precious because it is not sufficiently remote\r\nto be unknown, or sufficiently near to be enjoyed. The lower orders are\r\nagitated by the chance of success, they are irritated by its\r\nuncertainty; and they pass from the enthusiasm of pursuit to the\r\nexhaustion of ill-success, and lastly to the acrimony of\r\ndisappointment. Whatever transcends their own limits appears to be an\r\nobstacle to their desires, and there is no kind of superiority, however\r\nlegitimate it may be, which is not irksome in their sight.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the secret instinct which leads the lower\r\norders to remove their superiors as much as possible from the direction\r\nof public affairs is peculiar to France. This, however, is an error;\r\nthe propensity to which I allude is not inherent in any particular\r\nnation, but in democratic institutions in general; and although it may\r\nhave been heightened by peculiar political circumstances, it owes its\r\norigin to a higher cause.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the people is not disposed to hate the superior\r\nclasses of society; but it is not very favorably inclined towards them,\r\nand it carefully excludes them from the exercise of authority. It does\r\nnot entertain any dread of distinguished talents, but it is rarely\r\ncaptivated by them; and it awards its approbation very sparingly to\r\nsuch as have risen without the popular support.\r\n\r\nWhilst the natural propensities of democracy induce the people to\r\nreject the most distinguished citizens as its rulers, these individuals\r\nare no less apt to retire from a political career in which it is almost\r\nimpossible to retain their independence, or to advance without\r\ndegrading themselves. This opinion has been very candidly set forth by\r\nChancellor Kent, who says, in speaking with great eulogiums of that\r\npart of the Constitution which empowers the Executive to nominate the\r\njudges: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed probable that the men who are best fitted to\r\ndischarge the duties of this high office would have too much reserve in\r\ntheir manners, and too much austerity in their principles, for them to\r\nbe returned by the majority at an election where universal suffrage is\r\nadopted.\xe2\x80\x9d Such were the opinions which were printed without\r\ncontradiction in America in the year 1830!\r\n\r\nI hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated that universal suffrage is by\r\nno means a guarantee of the wisdom of the popular choice, and that,\r\nwhatever its advantages may be, this is not one of them.\r\n\r\nCauses Which May Partly Correct These Tendencies Of The Democracy\r\nContrary effects produced on peoples as well as on individuals by great\r\ndangers\xe2\x80\x94Why so many distinguished men stood at the head of affairs in\r\nAmerica fifty years ago\xe2\x80\x94Influence which the intelligence and the\r\nmanners of the people exercise upon its choice\xe2\x80\x94Example of New\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94States of the Southwest\xe2\x80\x94Influence of certain laws upon the\r\nchoice of the people\xe2\x80\x94Election by an elected body\xe2\x80\x94Its effects upon the\r\ncomposition of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen a State is threatened by serious dangers, the people frequently\r\nsucceeds in selecting the citizens who are the most able to save it. It\r\nhas been observed that man rarely retains his customary level in\r\npresence of very critical circumstances; he rises above or he sinks\r\nbelow his usual condition, and the same thing occurs in nations at\r\nlarge. Extreme perils sometimes quench the energy of a people instead\r\nof stimulating it; they excite without directing its passions, and\r\ninstead of clearing they confuse its powers of perception. The Jews\r\ndeluged the smoking ruins of their temple with the carnage of the\r\nremnant of their host. But it is more common, both in the case of\r\nnations and in that of individuals, to find extraordinary virtues\r\narising from the very imminence of the danger. Great characters are\r\nthen thrown into relief, as edifices which are concealed by the gloom\r\nof night are illuminated by the glare of a conflagration. At those\r\ndangerous times genius no longer abstains from presenting itself in the\r\narena; and the people, alarmed by the perils of its situation, buries\r\nits envious passions in a short oblivion. Great names may then be drawn\r\nfrom the balloting-box.\r\n\r\nI have already observed that the American statesmen of the present day\r\nare very inferior to those who stood at the head of affairs fifty years\r\nago. This is as much a consequence of the circumstances as of the laws\r\nof the country. When America was struggling in the high cause of\r\nindependence to throw off the yoke of another country, and when it was\r\nabout to usher a new nation into the world, the spirits of its\r\ninhabitants were roused to the height which their great efforts\r\nrequired. In this general excitement the most distinguished men were\r\nready to forestall the wants of the community, and the people clung to\r\nthem for support, and placed them at its head. But events of this\r\nmagnitude are rare, and it is from an inspection of the ordinary course\r\nof affairs that our judgment must be formed.\r\n\r\nIf passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the passions of\r\ndemocracy, the intelligence and the manners of the community exercise\r\nan influence which is not less powerful and far more permanent. This is\r\nextremely perceptible in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn New England the education and the liberties of the communities were\r\nengendered by the moral and religious principles of their founders.\r\nWhere society has acquired a sufficient degree of stability to enable\r\nit to hold certain maxims and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders\r\nare accustomed to respect intellectual superiority and to submit to it\r\nwithout complaint, although they set at naught all those privileges\r\nwhich wealth and birth have introduced among mankind. The democracy in\r\nNew England consequently makes a more judicious choice than it does\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut as we descend towards the South, to those States in which the\r\nconstitution of society is more modern and less strong, where\r\ninstruction is less general, and where the principles of morality, of\r\nreligion, and of liberty are less happily combined, we perceive that\r\nthe talents and the virtues of those who are in authority become more\r\nand more rare.\r\n\r\nLastly, when we arrive at the new South-western States, in which the\r\nconstitution of society dates but from yesterday, and presents an\r\nagglomeration of adventurers and speculators, we are amazed at the\r\npersons who are invested with public authority, and we are led to ask\r\nby what force, independent of the legislation and of the men who direct\r\nit, the State can be protected, and society be made to flourish.\r\n\r\nThere are certain laws of a democratic nature which contribute,\r\nnevertheless, to correct, in some measure, the dangerous tendencies of\r\ndemocracy. On entering the House of Representatives of Washington one\r\nis struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. The eye\r\nfrequently does not discover a man of celebrity within its walls. Its\r\nmembers are almost all obscure individuals whose names present no\r\nassociations to the mind: they are mostly village lawyers, men in\r\ntrade, or even persons belonging to the lower classes of society. In a\r\ncountry in which education is very general, it is said that the\r\nrepresentatives of the people do not always know how to write\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nAt a few yards\xe2\x80\x99 distance from this spot is the door of the Senate,\r\nwhich contains within a small space a large proportion of the\r\ncelebrated men of America. Scarcely an individual is to be perceived in\r\nit who does not recall the idea of an active and illustrious career:\r\nthe Senate is composed of eloquent advocates, distinguished generals,\r\nwise magistrates, and statesmen of note, whose language would at all\r\ntimes do honor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the cause of this strange contrast, and why are the most\r\nable citizens to be found in one assembly rather than in the other? Why\r\nis the former body remarkable for its vulgarity and its poverty of\r\ntalent, whilst the latter seems to enjoy a monopoly of intelligence and\r\nof sound judgment? Both of these assemblies emanate from the people;\r\nboth of them are chosen by universal suffrage; and no voice has\r\nhitherto been heard to assert in America that the Senate is hostile to\r\nthe interests of the people. From what cause, then, does so startling a\r\ndifference arise? The only reason which appears to me adequately to\r\naccount for it is, that the House of Representatives is elected by the\r\npopulace directly, and that the Senate is elected by elected bodies.\r\nThe whole body of the citizens names the legislature of each State, and\r\nthe Federal Constitution converts these legislatures into so many\r\nelectoral bodies, which return the members of the Senate. The senators\r\nare elected by an indirect application of universal suffrage; for the\r\nlegislatures which name them are not aristocratic or privileged bodies\r\nwhich exercise the electoral franchise in their own right; but they are\r\nchosen by the totality of the citizens; they are generally elected\r\nevery year, and new members may constantly be chosen who will employ\r\ntheir electoral rights in conformity with the wishes of the public. But\r\nthis transmission of the popular authority through an assembly of\r\nchosen men operates an important change in it, by refining its\r\ndiscretion and improving the forms which it adopts. Men who are chosen\r\nin this manner accurately represent the majority of the nation which\r\ngoverns them; but they represent the elevated thoughts which are\r\ncurrent in the community, the propensities which prompt its nobler\r\nactions, rather than the petty passions which disturb or the vices\r\nwhich disgrace it.\r\n\r\nThe time may be already anticipated at which the American Republics\r\nwill be obliged to introduce the plan of election by an elected body\r\nmore frequently into their system of representation, or they will incur\r\nno small risk of perishing miserably amongst the shoals of democracy.\r\n\r\nAnd here I have no scruple in confessing that I look upon this peculiar\r\nsystem of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of\r\npolitical power to the level of all classes of the people. Those\r\nthinkers who regard this institution as the exclusive weapon of a\r\nparty, and those who fear, on the other hand, to make use of it, seem\r\nto me to fall into as great an error in the one case as in the other.\r\n\r\nInfluence Which The American Democracy Has Exercised On The Laws\r\nRelating To Elections\r\n\r\nWhen elections are rare, they expose the State to a violent crisis\xe2\x80\x94When\r\nthey are frequent, they keep up a degree of feverish excitement\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nAmericans have preferred the second of these two evils\xe2\x80\x94Mutability of\r\nthe laws\xe2\x80\x94Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson on this subject.\r\n\r\nWhen elections recur at long intervals the State is exposed to violent\r\nagitation every time they take place. Parties exert themselves to the\r\nutmost in order to gain a prize which is so rarely within their reach;\r\nand as the evil is almost irremediable for the candidates who fail, the\r\nconsequences of their disappointed ambition may prove most disastrous;\r\nif, on the other hand, the legal struggle can be repeated within a\r\nshort space of time, the defeated parties take patience. When elections\r\noccur frequently, their recurrence keeps society in a perpetual state\r\nof feverish excitement, and imparts a continual instability to public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThus, on the one hand the State is exposed to the perils of a\r\nrevolution, on the other to perpetual mutability; the former system\r\nthreatens the very existence of the Government, the latter is an\r\nobstacle to all steady and consistent policy. The Americans have\r\npreferred the second of these evils to the first; but they were led to\r\nthis conclusion by their instinct much more than by their reason; for a\r\ntaste for variety is one of the characteristic passions of democracy.\r\nAn extraordinary mutability has, by this means, been introduced into\r\ntheir legislation. Many of the Americans consider the instability of\r\ntheir laws as a necessary consequence of a system whose general results\r\nare beneficial. But no one in the United States affects to deny the\r\nfact of this instability, or to contend that it is not a great evil.\r\n\r\nHamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power which might\r\nprevent, or which might at least impede, the promulgation of bad laws,\r\nadds: \xe2\x80\x9cIt might perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws\r\nincludes that of preventing good ones, and may be used to the one\r\npurpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have little\r\nweight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that\r\ninconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest blemish\r\nin the character and genius of our governments.\xe2\x80\x9d (Federalist, No. 73.)\r\nAnd again in No. 62 of the same work he observes: \xe2\x80\x9cThe facility and\r\nexcess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments\r\nare most liable. . . . The mischievous effects of the mutability in the\r\npublic councils arising from a rapid succession of new members would\r\nfill a volume: every new election in the States is found to change\r\none-half of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed a\r\nchange of opinions and of measures, which forfeits the respect and\r\nconfidence of other nations, poisons the blessings of liberty itself,\r\nand diminishes the attachment and reverence of the people toward a\r\npolitical system which betrays so many marks of infirmity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJefferson himself, the greatest Democrat whom the democracy of America\r\nhas yet produced, pointed out the same evils. \xe2\x80\x9cThe instability of our\r\nlaws,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a letter to Madison, \xe2\x80\x9cis really a very serious\r\ninconvenience. I think that we ought to have obviated it by deciding\r\nthat a whole year should always be allowed to elapse between the\r\nbringing in of a bill and the final passing of it. It should afterward\r\nbe discussed and put to the vote without the possibility of making any\r\nalteration in it; and if the circumstances of the case required a more\r\nspeedy decision, the question should not be decided by a simple\r\nmajority, but by a majority of at least two-thirds of both houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Under The Control Of The Democracy In America Simple\r\nexterior of the American public officers\xe2\x80\x94No official costume\xe2\x80\x94All public\r\nofficers are remunerated\xe2\x80\x94Political consequences of this system\xe2\x80\x94No\r\npublic career exists in America\xe2\x80\x94Result of this.\r\n\r\nPublic officers in the United States are commingled with the crowd of\r\ncitizens; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial\r\ncostumes. This simple exterior of the persons in authority is connected\r\nnot only with the peculiarities of the American character, but with the\r\nfundamental principles of that society. In the estimation of the\r\ndemocracy a government is not a benefit, but a necessary evil. A\r\ncertain degree of power must be granted to public officers, for they\r\nwould be of no use without it. But the ostensible semblance of\r\nauthority is by no means indispensable to the conduct of affairs, and\r\nit is needlessly offensive to the susceptibility of the public. The\r\npublic officers themselves are well aware that they only enjoy the\r\nsuperiority over their fellow-citizens which they derive from their\r\nauthority upon condition of putting themselves on a level with the\r\nwhole community by their manners. A public officer in the United States\r\nis uniformly civil, accessible to all the world, attentive to all\r\nrequests, and obliging in his replies. I was pleased by these\r\ncharacteristics of a democratic government; and I was struck by the\r\nmanly independence of the citizens, who respect the office more than\r\nthe officer, and who are less attached to the emblems of authority than\r\nto the man who bears them.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the influence which costumes really\r\nexercise, in an age like that in which we live, has been a good deal\r\nexaggerated. I never perceived that a public officer in America was the\r\nless respected whilst he was in the discharge of his duties because his\r\nown merit was set off by no adventitious signs. On the other hand, it\r\nis very doubtful whether a peculiar dress contributes to the respect\r\nwhich public characters ought to have for their own position, at least\r\nwhen they are not otherwise inclined to respect it. When a magistrate\r\n(and in France such instances are not rare) indulges his trivial wit at\r\nthe expense of the prisoner, or derides the predicament in which a\r\nculprit is placed, it would be well to deprive him of his robes of\r\noffice, to see whether he would recall some portion of the natural\r\ndignity of mankind when he is reduced to the apparel of a private\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nA democracy may, however, allow a certain show of magisterial pomp, and\r\nclothe its officers in silks and gold, without seriously compromising\r\nits principles. Privileges of this kind are transitory; they belong to\r\nthe place, and are distinct from the individual: but if public officers\r\nare not uniformly remunerated by the State, the public charges must be\r\nentrusted to men of opulence and independence, who constitute the basis\r\nof an aristocracy; and if the people still retains its right of\r\nelection, that election can only be made from a certain class of\r\ncitizens. When a democratic republic renders offices which had formerly\r\nbeen remunerated gratuitous, it may safely be believed that the State\r\nis advancing to monarchical institutions; and when a monarchy begins to\r\nremunerate such officers as had hitherto been unpaid, it is a sure sign\r\nthat it is approaching toward a despotic or a republican form of\r\ngovernment. The substitution of paid for unpaid functionaries is of\r\nitself, in my opinion, sufficient to constitute a serious revolution.\r\n\r\nI look upon the entire absence of gratuitous functionaries in America\r\nas one of the most prominent signs of the absolute dominion which\r\ndemocracy exercises in that country. All public services, of whatsoever\r\nnature they may be, are paid; so that every one has not merely the\r\nright, but also the means of performing them. Although, in democratic\r\nStates, all the citizens are qualified to occupy stations in the\r\nGovernment, all are not tempted to try for them. The number and the\r\ncapacities of the candidates are more apt to restrict the choice of\r\nelectors than the connections of the candidateship.\r\n\r\nIn nations in which the principle of election extends to every place in\r\nthe State no political career can, properly speaking, be said to exist.\r\nMen are promoted as if by chance to the rank which they enjoy, and they\r\nare by no means sure of retaining it. The consequence is that in\r\ntranquil times public functions offer but few lures to ambition. In the\r\nUnited States the persons who engage in the perplexities of political\r\nlife are individuals of very moderate pretensions. The pursuit of\r\nwealth generally diverts men of great talents and of great passions\r\nfrom the pursuit of power, and it very frequently happens that a man\r\ndoes not undertake to direct the fortune of the State until he has\r\ndiscovered his incompetence to conduct his own affairs. The vast number\r\nof very ordinary men who occupy public stations is quite as\r\nattributable to these causes as to the bad choice of the democracy. In\r\nthe United States, I am not sure that the people would return the men\r\nof superior abilities who might solicit its support, but it is certain\r\nthat men of this description do not come forward.\r\n\r\nArbitrary Power Of Magistrates Under The Rule Of The American Democracy\r\n\r\nFor what reason the arbitrary power of Magistrates is greater in\r\nabsolute monarchies and in democratic republics than it is in limited\r\nmonarchies\xe2\x80\x94Arbitrary power of the Magistrates in New England.\r\n\r\nIn two different kinds of government the magistrates *a exercise a\r\nconsiderable degree of arbitrary power; namely, under the absolute\r\ngovernment of a single individual, and under that of a democracy. This\r\nidentical result proceeds from causes which are nearly analogous.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ I here use the word magistrates in the widest sense in which it can\r\nbe taken; I apply it to all the officers to whom the execution of the\r\nlaws is intrusted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn despotic States the fortune of no citizen is secure; and public\r\nofficers are not more safe than private individuals. The sovereign, who\r\nhas under his control the lives, the property, and sometimes the honor\r\nof the men whom he employs, does not scruple to allow them a great\r\nlatitude of action, because he is convinced that they will not use it\r\nto his prejudice. In despotic States the sovereign is so attached to\r\nthe exercise of his power, that he dislikes the constraint even of his\r\nown regulations; and he is well pleased that his agents should follow a\r\nsomewhat fortuitous line of conduct, provided he be certain that their\r\nactions will never counteract his desires.\r\n\r\nIn democracies, as the majority has every year the right of depriving\r\nthe officers whom it has appointed of their power, it has no reason to\r\nfear any abuse of their authority. As the people is always able to\r\nsignify its wishes to those who conduct the Government, it prefers\r\nleaving them to make their own exertions to prescribing an invariable\r\nrule of conduct which would at once fetter their activity and the\r\npopular authority.\r\n\r\nIt may even be observed, on attentive consideration, that under the\r\nrule of a democracy the arbitrary power of the magistrate must be still\r\ngreater than in despotic States. In the latter the sovereign has the\r\npower of punishing all the faults with which he becomes acquainted, but\r\nit would be vain for him to hope to become acquainted with all those\r\nwhich are committed. In the former the sovereign power is not only\r\nsupreme, but it is universally present. The American functionaries are,\r\nin point of fact, much more independent in the sphere of action which\r\nthe law traces out for them than any public officer in Europe. Very\r\nfrequently the object which they are to accomplish is simply pointed\r\nout to them, and the choice of the means is left to their own\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nIn New England, for instance, the selectmen of each township are bound\r\nto draw up the list of persons who are to serve on the jury; the only\r\nrule which is laid down to guide them in their choice is that they are\r\nto select citizens possessing the elective franchise and enjoying a\r\nfair reputation. *b In France the lives and liberties of the subjects\r\nwould be thought to be in danger if a public officer of any kind was\r\nentrusted with so formidable a right. In New England the same\r\nmagistrates are empowered to post the names of habitual drunkards in\r\npublic-houses, and to prohibit the inhabitants of a town from supplying\r\nthem with liquor. *c A censorial power of this excessive kind would be\r\nrevolting to the population of the most absolute monarchies; here,\r\nhowever, it is submitted to without difficulty.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ See the Act of February 27, 1813. \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Collection of the Laws of\r\nMassachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. ii. p. 331. It should be added that the jurors are\r\nafterwards drawn from these lists by lot.]\r\n\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ See Act of February 28, 1787. \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Collection of the Laws of\r\nMassachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. i. p. 302.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere has so much been left by the law to the arbitrary determination\r\nof the magistrate as in democratic republics, because this arbitrary\r\npower is unattended by any alarming consequences. It may even be\r\nasserted that the freedom of the magistrate increases as the elective\r\nfranchise is extended, and as the duration of the time of office is\r\nshortened. Hence arises the great difficulty which attends the\r\nconversion of a democratic republic into a monarchy. The magistrate\r\nceases to be elective, but he retains the rights and the habits of an\r\nelected officer, which lead directly to despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is only in limited monarchies that the law, which prescribes the\r\nsphere in which public officers are to act, superintends all their\r\nmeasures. The cause of this may be easily detected. In limited\r\nmonarchies the power is divided between the King and the people, both\r\nof whom are interested in the stability of the magistrate. The King\r\ndoes not venture to place the public officers under the control of the\r\npeople, lest they should be tempted to betray his interests; on the\r\nother hand, the people fears lest the magistrates should serve to\r\noppress the liberties of the country, if they were entirely dependent\r\nupon the Crown; they cannot therefore be said to depend on either one\r\nor the other. The same cause which induces the king and the people to\r\nrender public officers independent suggests the necessity of such\r\nsecurities as may prevent their independence from encroaching upon the\r\nauthority of the former and the liberties of the latter. They\r\nconsequently agree as to the necessity of restricting the functionary\r\nto a line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they are interested in\r\nconfining him by certain regulations which he cannot evade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XIII: Government Of The Democracy In America\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\nInstability Of The Administration In The United States\r\n\r\nIn America the public acts of a community frequently leave fewer traces\r\nthan the occurrences of a family\xe2\x80\x94Newspapers the only historical\r\nremains\xe2\x80\x94Instability of the administration prejudicial to the art of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe authority which public men possess in America is so brief, and they\r\nare so soon commingled with the ever-changing population of the\r\ncountry, that the acts of a community frequently leave fewer traces\r\nthan the occurrences of a private family. The public administration is,\r\nso to speak, oral and traditionary. But little is committed to writing,\r\nand that little is wafted away forever, like the leaves of the Sibyl,\r\nby the smallest breeze.\r\n\r\nThe only historical remains in the United States are the newspapers;\r\nbut if a number be wanting, the chain of time is broken, and the\r\npresent is severed from the past. I am convinced that in fifty years it\r\nwill be more difficult to collect authentic documents concerning the\r\nsocial condition of the Americans at the present day than it is to find\r\nremains of the administration of France during the Middle Ages; and if\r\nthe United States were ever invaded by barbarians, it would be\r\nnecessary to have recourse to the history of other nations in order to\r\nlearn anything of the people which now inhabits them.\r\n\r\nThe instability of the administration has penetrated into the habits of\r\nthe people: it even appears to suit the general taste, and no one cares\r\nfor what occurred before his time. No methodical system is pursued; no\r\narchives are formed; and no documents are brought together when it\r\nwould be very easy to do so. Where they exist, little store is set upon\r\nthem; and I have amongst my papers several original public documents\r\nwhich were given to me in answer to some of my inquiries. In America\r\nsociety seems to live from hand to mouth, like an army in the field.\r\nNevertheless, the art of administration may undoubtedly be ranked as a\r\nscience, and no sciences can be improved if the discoveries and\r\nobservations of successive generations are not connected together in\r\nthe order in which they occur. One man, in the short space of his life\r\nremarks a fact; another conceives an idea; the former invents a means\r\nof execution, the latter reduces a truth to a fixed proposition; and\r\nmankind gathers the fruits of individual experience upon its way and\r\ngradually forms the sciences. But the persons who conduct the\r\nadministration in America can seldom afford any instruction to each\r\nother; and when they assume the direction of society, they simply\r\npossess those attainments which are most widely disseminated in the\r\ncommunity, and no experience peculiar to themselves. Democracy, carried\r\nto its furthest limits, is therefore prejudicial to the art of\r\ngovernment; and for this reason it is better adapted to a people\r\nalready versed in the conduct of an administration than to a nation\r\nwhich is uninitiated in public affairs.\r\n\r\nThis remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the science of\r\nadministration. Although a democratic government is founded upon a very\r\nsimple and natural principle, it always presupposes the existence of a\r\nhigh degree of culture and enlightenment in society. *d At the first\r\nglance it may be imagined to belong to the earliest ages of the world;\r\nbut maturer observation will convince us that it could only come last\r\nin the succession of human history.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ It is needless to observe that I speak here of the democratic form of\r\ngovernment as applied to a people, not merely to a tribe.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharges Levied By The State Under The Rule Of The American Democracy\r\n\r\nIn all communities citizens divisible into three classes\xe2\x80\x94Habits of each\r\nof these classes in the direction of public finances\xe2\x80\x94Why public\r\nexpenditure must tend to increase when the people governs\xe2\x80\x94What renders\r\nthe extravagance of a democracy less to be feared in America\xe2\x80\x94Public\r\nexpenditure under a democracy.\r\n\r\nBefore we can affirm whether a democratic form of government is\r\neconomical or not, we must establish a suitable standard of comparison.\r\nThe question would be one of easy solution if we were to attempt to\r\ndraw a parallel between a democratic republic and an absolute monarchy.\r\nThe public expenditure would be found to be more considerable under the\r\nformer than under the latter; such is the case with all free States\r\ncompared to those which are not so. It is certain that despotism ruins\r\nindividuals by preventing them from producing wealth, much more than by\r\ndepriving them of the wealth they have produced; it dries up the source\r\nof riches, whilst it usually respects acquired property. Freedom, on\r\nthe contrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and the\r\nnations which are favored by free institutions invariably find that\r\ntheir resources increase even more rapidly than their taxes.\r\n\r\nMy present object is to compare free nations to each other, and to\r\npoint out the influence of democracy upon the finances of a State.\r\n\r\nCommunities, as well as organic bodies, are subject to certain fixed\r\nrules in their formation which they cannot evade. They are composed of\r\ncertain elements which are common to them at all times and under all\r\ncircumstances. The people may always be mentally divided into three\r\ndistinct classes. The first of these classes consists of the wealthy;\r\nthe second, of those who are in easy circumstances; and the third is\r\ncomposed of those who have little or no property, and who subsist more\r\nespecially by the work which they perform for the two superior orders.\r\nThe proportion of the individuals who are included in these three\r\ndivisions may vary according to the condition of society, but the\r\ndivisions themselves can never be obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that each of these classes will exercise an influence\r\npeculiar to its own propensities upon the administration of the\r\nfinances of the State. If the first of the three exclusively possesses\r\nthe legislative power, it is probable that it will not be sparing of\r\nthe public funds, because the taxes which are levied on a large fortune\r\nonly tend to diminish the sum of superfluous enjoyment, and are, in\r\npoint of fact, but little felt. If the second class has the power of\r\nmaking the laws, it will certainly not be lavish of taxes, because\r\nnothing is so onerous as a large impost which is levied upon a small\r\nincome. The government of the middle classes appears to me to be the\r\nmost economical, though perhaps not the most enlightened, and certainly\r\nnot the most generous, of free governments.\r\n\r\nBut let us now suppose that the legislative authority is vested in the\r\nlowest orders: there are two striking reasons which show that the\r\ntendency of the expenditure will be to increase, not to diminish. As\r\nthe great majority of those who create the laws are possessed of no\r\nproperty upon which taxes can be imposed, all the money which is spent\r\nfor the community appears to be spent to their advantage, at no cost of\r\ntheir own; and those who are possessed of some little property readily\r\nfind means of regulating the taxes so that they are burdensome to the\r\nwealthy and profitable to the poor, although the rich are unable to\r\ntake the same advantage when they are in possession of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn countries in which the poor *e should be exclusively invested with\r\nthe power of making the laws no great economy of public expenditure\r\nought to be expected: that expenditure will always be considerable;\r\neither because the taxes do not weigh upon those who levy them, or\r\nbecause they are levied in such a manner as not to weigh upon those\r\nclasses. In other words, the government of the democracy is the only\r\none under which the power which lays on taxes escapes the payment of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ The word poor is used here, and throughout the remainder of this\r\nchapter, in a relative, not in an absolute sense. Poor men in America\r\nwould often appear rich in comparison with the poor of Europe; but they\r\nmay with propriety by styled poor in comparison with their more\r\naffluent countrymen.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be objected (but the argument has no real weight) that the true\r\ninterest of the people is indissolubly connected with that of the\r\nwealthier portion of the community, since it cannot but suffer by the\r\nsevere measures to which it resorts. But is it not the true interest of\r\nkings to render their subjects happy, and the true interest of nobles\r\nto admit recruits into their order on suitable grounds? If remote\r\nadvantages had power to prevail over the passions and the exigencies of\r\nthe moment, no such thing as a tyrannical sovereign or an exclusive\r\naristocracy could ever exist.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be objected that the poor are never invested with the\r\nsole power of making the laws; but I reply, that wherever universal\r\nsuffrage has been established the majority of the community\r\nunquestionably exercises the legislative authority; and if it be proved\r\nthat the poor always constitute the majority, it may be added, with\r\nperfect truth, that in the countries in which they possess the elective\r\nfranchise they possess the sole power of making laws. But it is certain\r\nthat in all the nations of the world the greater number has always\r\nconsisted of those persons who hold no property, or of those whose\r\nproperty is insufficient to exempt them from the necessity of working\r\nin order to procure an easy subsistence. Universal suffrage does\r\ntherefore, in point of fact, invest the poor with the government of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous influence which popular authority may sometimes exercise\r\nupon the finances of a State was very clearly seen in some of the\r\ndemocratic republics of antiquity, in which the public treasure was\r\nexhausted in order to relieve indigent citizens, or to supply the games\r\nand theatrical amusements of the populace. It is true that the\r\nrepresentative system was then very imperfectly known, and that, at the\r\npresent time, the influence of popular passion is less felt in the\r\nconduct of public affairs; but it may be believed that the delegate\r\nwill in the end conform to the principles of his constituents, and\r\nfavor their propensities as much as their interests.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of democracy is, however, less to be dreaded in\r\nproportion as the people acquires a share of property, because on the\r\none hand the contributions of the rich are then less needed, and, on\r\nthe other, it is more difficult to lay on taxes which do not affect the\r\ninterests of the lower classes. On this account universal suffrage\r\nwould be less dangerous in France than in England, because in the\r\nlatter country the property on which taxes may be levied is vested in\r\nfewer hands. America, where the great majority of the citizens possess\r\nsome fortune, is in a still more favorable position than France.\r\n\r\nThere are still further causes which may increase the sum of public\r\nexpenditure in democratic countries. When the aristocracy governs, the\r\nindividuals who conduct the affairs of State are exempted by their own\r\nstation in society from every kind of privation; they are contented\r\nwith their position; power and renown are the objects for which they\r\nstrive; and, as they are placed far above the obscurer throng of\r\ncitizens, they do not always distinctly perceive how the well-being of\r\nthe mass of the people ought to redound to their own honor. They are\r\nnot indeed callous to the sufferings of the poor, but they cannot feel\r\nthose miseries as acutely as if they were themselves partakers of them.\r\nProvided that the people appear to submit to its lot, the rulers are\r\nsatisfied, and they demand nothing further from the Government. An\r\naristocracy is more intent upon the means of maintaining its influence\r\nthan upon the means of improving its condition.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, the people is invested with the supreme\r\nauthority, the perpetual sense of their own miseries impels the rulers\r\nof society to seek for perpetual ameliorations. A thousand different\r\nobjects are subjected to improvement; the most trivial details are\r\nsought out as susceptible of amendment; and those changes which are\r\naccompanied with considerable expense are more especially advocated,\r\nsince the object is to render the condition of the poor more tolerable,\r\nwho cannot pay for themselves.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all democratic communities are agitated by an ill-defined\r\nexcitement and by a kind of feverish impatience, that engender a\r\nmultitude of innovations, almost all of which are attended with\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIn monarchies and aristocracies the natural taste which the rulers have\r\nfor power and for renown is stimulated by the promptings of ambition,\r\nand they are frequently incited by these temptations to very costly\r\nundertakings. In democracies, where the rulers labor under privations,\r\nthey can only be courted by such means as improve their well-being, and\r\nthese improvements cannot take place without a sacrifice of money. When\r\na people begins to reflect upon its situation, it discovers a multitude\r\nof wants to which it had not before been subject, and to satisfy these\r\nexigencies recourse must be had to the coffers of the State. Hence it\r\narises that the public charges increase in proportion as civilization\r\nspreads, and that imposts are augmented as knowledge pervades the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe last cause which frequently renders a democratic government dearer\r\nthan any other is, that a democracy does not always succeed in\r\nmoderating its expenditure, because it does not understand the art of\r\nbeing economical. As the designs which it entertains are frequently\r\nchanged, and the agents of those designs are still more frequently\r\nremoved, its undertakings are often ill conducted or left unfinished:\r\nin the former case the State spends sums out of all proportion to the\r\nend which it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the expense itself\r\nis unprofitable. *f\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ The gross receipts of the Treasury of the United States in 1832 were\r\nabout $28,000,000; in 1870 they had risen to $411,000,000. The gross\r\nexpenditure in 1832 was $30,000,000; in 1870, $309,000,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTendencies Of The American Democracy As Regards The Salaries Of Public\r\nOfficers\r\n\r\nIn the democracies those who establish high salaries have no chance of\r\nprofiting by them\xe2\x80\x94Tendency of the American democracy to increase the\r\nsalaries of subordinate officers and to lower those of the more\r\nimportant functionaries\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94Comparative statement of the\r\nsalaries of public officers in the United States and in France.\r\n\r\nThere is a powerful reason which usually induces democracies to\r\neconomize upon the salaries of public officers. As the number of\r\ncitizens who dispense the remuneration is extremely large in democratic\r\ncountries, so the number of persons who can hope to be benefited by the\r\nreceipt of it is comparatively small. In aristocratic countries, on the\r\ncontrary, the individuals who fix high salaries have almost always a\r\nvague hope of profiting by them. These appointments may be looked upon\r\nas a capital which they create for their own use, or at least as a\r\nresource for their children.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be allowed that a democratic State is most\r\nparsimonious towards its principal agents. In America the secondary\r\nofficers are much better paid, and the dignitaries of the\r\nadministration much worse, than they are elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThese opposite effects result from the same cause; the people fixes the\r\nsalaries of the public officers in both cases; and the scale of\r\nremuneration is determined by the consideration of its own wants. It is\r\nheld to be fair that the servants of the public should be placed in the\r\nsame easy circumstances as the public itself; *g but when the question\r\nturns upon the salaries of the great officers of State, this rule\r\nfails, and chance alone can guide the popular decision. The poor have\r\nno adequate conception of the wants which the higher classes of society\r\nmay feel. The sum which is scanty to the rich appears enormous to the\r\npoor man whose wants do not extend beyond the necessaries of life; and\r\nin his estimation the Governor of a State, with his twelve or fifteen\r\nhundred dollars a year, is a very fortunate and enviable being. *h If\r\nyou undertake to convince him that the representative of a great people\r\nought to be able to maintain some show of splendor in the eyes of\r\nforeign nations, he will perhaps assent to your meaning; but when he\r\nreflects on his own humble dwelling, and on the hard-earned produce of\r\nhis wearisome toil, he remembers all that he could do with a salary\r\nwhich you say is insufficient, and he is startled or almost frightened\r\nat the sight of such uncommon wealth. Besides, the secondary public\r\nofficer is almost on a level with the people, whilst the others are\r\nraised above it. The former may therefore excite his interest, but the\r\nlatter begins to arouse his envy.\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ The easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries are placed in\r\nthe United States result also from another cause, which is independent\r\nof the general tendencies of democracy; every kind of private business\r\nis very lucrative, and the State would not be served at all if it did\r\nnot pay its servants. The country is in the position of a commercial\r\nundertaking, which is obliged to sustain an expensive competition,\r\nnotwithstanding its tastes for economy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ The State of Ohio, which contains a million of inhabitants, gives its\r\nGovernor a salary of only $1,200 a year.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very clearly seen in the United States, where the salaries seem\r\nto decrease as the authority of those who receive them augments *i\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ To render this assertion perfectly evident, it will suffice to\r\nexamine the scale of salaries of the agents of the Federal Government.\r\nI have added the salaries attached to the corresponding officers in\r\nFrance under the constitutional monarchy to complete the comparison.\r\n\r\n     United States\r\n     Treasury Department\r\n     Messenger ............................   $700\r\n     Clerk with lowest salary .............  1,000\r\n     Clerk with highest salary ............  1,600\r\n     Chief Clerk ..........................  2,000\r\n     Secretary of State ...................  6,000\r\n     The President ........................ 25,000\r\n\r\n     France\r\n     Ministere des Finances\r\n     Hussier ........................... 1,500 fr.\r\n     Clerk with lowest salary,  1,000 to 1,800 fr.\r\n     Clerk with highest salary  3,200 to 8,600 fr.\r\n     Secretaire-general ................20,000 fr.\r\n     The Minister ......................80,000 fr.\r\n     The King ......................12,000,000 fr.\r\n\r\nI have perhaps done wrong in selecting France as my standard of\r\ncomparison. In France the democratic tendencies of the nation exercise\r\nan ever-increasing influence upon the Government, and the Chambers show\r\na disposition to raise the low salaries and to lower the principal\r\nones. Thus, the Minister of Finance, who received 160,000 fr. under the\r\nEmpire, receives 80,000 fr. in 1835: the Directeurs-generaux of\r\nFinance, who then received 50,000 fr. now receive only 20,000 fr. [This\r\ncomparison is based on the state of things existing in France and the\r\nUnited States in 1831. It has since materially altered in both\r\ncountries, but not so much as to impugn the truth of the author\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservation.]]\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of an aristocracy it frequently happens, on the\r\ncontrary, that whilst the high officers are receiving munificent\r\nsalaries, the inferior ones have not more than enough to procure the\r\nnecessaries of life. The reason of this fact is easily discoverable\r\nfrom causes very analogous to those to which I have just alluded. If a\r\ndemocracy is unable to conceive the pleasures of the rich or to witness\r\nthem without envy, an aristocracy is slow to understand, or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, is unacquainted with, the privations of the poor. The\r\npoor man is not (if we use the term aright) the fellow of the rich one;\r\nbut he is a being of another species. An aristocracy is therefore apt\r\nto care but little for the fate of its subordinate agents; and their\r\nsalaries are only raised when they refuse to perform their service for\r\ntoo scanty a remuneration.\r\n\r\nIt is the parsimonious conduct of democracy towards its principal\r\nofficers which has countenanced a supposition of far more economical\r\npropensities than any which it really possesses. It is true that it\r\nscarcely allows the means of honorable subsistence to the individuals\r\nwho conduct its affairs; but enormous sums are lavished to meet the\r\nexigencies or to facilitate the enjoyments of the people. *j The money\r\nraised by taxation may be better employed, but it is not saved. In\r\ngeneral, democracy gives largely to the community, and very sparingly\r\nto those who govern it. The reverse is the case in aristocratic\r\ncountries, where the money of the State is expended to the profit of\r\nthe persons who are at the head of affairs.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ See the American budgets for the cost of indigent citizens and\r\ngratuitous instruction. In 1831 $250,000 were spent in the State of New\r\nYork for the maintenance of the poor, and at least $1,000,000 were\r\ndevoted to gratuitous instruction. (William\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNew York Annual\r\nRegister,\xe2\x80\x9d 1832, pp. 205 and 243.) The State of New York contained only\r\n1,900,000 inhabitants in the year 1830, which is not more than double\r\nthe amount of population in the Department du Nord in France.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulty of Distinguishing The Causes Which Contribute To The Economy\r\nOf The American Government\r\n\r\nWe are liable to frequent errors in the research of those facts which\r\nexercise a serious influence upon the fate of mankind, since nothing is\r\nmore difficult than to appreciate their real value. One people is\r\nnaturally inconsistent and enthusiastic; another is sober and\r\ncalculating; and these characteristics originate in their physical\r\nconstitution or in remote causes with which we are unacquainted.\r\n\r\nThese are nations which are fond of parade and the bustle of festivity,\r\nand which do not regret the costly gaieties of an hour. Others, on the\r\ncontrary, are attached to more retiring pleasures, and seem almost\r\nashamed of appearing to be pleased. In some countries the highest value\r\nis set upon the beauty of public edifices; in others the productions of\r\nart are treated with indifference, and everything which is unproductive\r\nis looked down upon with contempt. In some renown, in others money, is\r\nthe ruling passion.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the laws, all these causes concur to exercise a very\r\npowerful influence upon the conduct of the finances of the State. If\r\nthe Americans never spend the money of the people in galas, it is not\r\nonly because the imposition of taxes is under the control of the\r\npeople, but because the people takes no delight in public rejoicings.\r\nIf they repudiate all ornament from their architecture, and set no\r\nstore on any but the more practical and homely advantages, it is not\r\nonly because they live under democratic institutions, but because they\r\nare a commercial nation. The habits of private life are continued in\r\npublic; and we ought carefully to distinguish that economy which\r\ndepends upon their institutions from that which is the natural result\r\nof their manners and customs.\r\n\r\nWhether The Expenditure Of The United States Can Be Compared To That Of\r\nFrance\r\n\r\nTwo points to be established in order to estimate the extent of the\r\npublic charges, viz., the national wealth and the rate of taxation\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nwealth and the charges of France not accurately known\xe2\x80\x94Why the wealth\r\nand charges of the Union cannot be accurately known\xe2\x80\x94Researches of the\r\nauthor with a view to discover the amount of taxation of\r\nPennsylvania\xe2\x80\x94General symptoms which may serve to indicate the amount of\r\nthe public charges in a given nation\xe2\x80\x94Result of this investigation for\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have recently been made in France to compare the public\r\nexpenditure of that country with the expenditure of the United States;\r\nall these attempts have, however, been unattended by success, and a few\r\nwords will suffice to show that they could not have had a satisfactory\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the amount of the public charges of a people two\r\npreliminaries are indispensable: it is necessary, in the first place,\r\nto know the wealth of that people; and in the second, to learn what\r\nportion of that wealth is devoted to the expenditure of the State. To\r\nshow the amount of taxation without showing the resources which are\r\ndestined to meet the demand, is to undertake a futile labor; for it is\r\nnot the expenditure, but the relation of the expenditure to the\r\nrevenue, which it is desirable to know.\r\n\r\nThe same rate of taxation which may easily be supported by a wealthy\r\ncontributor will reduce a poor one to extreme misery. The wealth of\r\nnations is composed of several distinct elements, of which population\r\nis the first, real property the second, and personal property the\r\nthird. The first of these three elements may be discovered without\r\ndifficulty. Amongst civilized nations it is easy to obtain an accurate\r\ncensus of the inhabitants; but the two others cannot be determined with\r\nso much facility. It is difficult to take an exact account of all the\r\nlands in a country which are under cultivation, with their natural or\r\ntheir acquired value; and it is still more impossible to estimate the\r\nentire personal property which is at the disposal of a nation, and\r\nwhich eludes the strictest analysis by the diversity and the number of\r\nshapes under which it may occur. And, indeed, we find that the most\r\nancient civilized nations of Europe, including even those in which the\r\nadministration is most central, have not succeeded, as yet, in\r\ndetermining the exact condition of their wealth.\r\n\r\nIn America the attempt has never been made; for how would such an\r\ninvestigation be possible in a country where society has not yet\r\nsettled into habits of regularity and tranquillity; where the national\r\nGovernment is not assisted by a multiple of agents whose exertions it\r\ncan command and direct to one sole end; and where statistics are not\r\nstudied, because no one is able to collect the necessary documents, or\r\nto find time to peruse them? Thus the primary elements of the\r\ncalculations which have been made in France cannot be obtained in the\r\nUnion; the relative wealth of the two countries is unknown; the\r\nproperty of the former is not accurately determined, and no means exist\r\nof computing that of the latter.\r\n\r\nI consent, therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to abandon this\r\nnecessary term of the comparison, and I confine myself to a computation\r\nof the actual amount of taxation, without investigating the relation\r\nwhich subsists between the taxation and the revenue. But the reader\r\nwill perceive that my task has not been facilitated by the limits which\r\nI here lay down for my researches.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the central administration of France,\r\nassisted by all the public officers who are at its disposal, might\r\ndetermine with exactitude the amount of the direct and indirect taxes\r\nlevied upon the citizens. But this investigation, which no private\r\nindividual can undertake, has not hitherto been completed by the French\r\nGovernment, or, at least, its results have not been made public. We are\r\nacquainted with the sum total of the charges of the State; we know the\r\namount of the departmental expenditure; but the expenses of the\r\ncommunal divisions have not been computed, and the amount of the public\r\nexpenses of France is consequently unknown.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to America, we shall perceive that the difficulties are\r\nmultiplied and enhanced. The Union publishes an exact return of the\r\namount of its expenditure; the budgets of the four and twenty States\r\nfurnish similar returns of their revenues; but the expenses incident to\r\nthe affairs of the counties and the townships are unknown. *k\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ The Americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets, the\r\nUnion, the States, the Counties, and the Townships having each\r\nseverally their own. During my stay in America I made every endeavor to\r\ndiscover the amount of the public expenditure in the townships and\r\ncounties of the principal States of the Union, and I readily obtained\r\nthe budget of the larger townships, but I found it quite impossible to\r\nprocure that of the smaller ones. I possess, however, some documents\r\nrelating to county expenses, which, although incomplete, are still\r\ncurious. I have to thank Mr. Richards, Mayor of Philadelphia, for the\r\nbudgets of thirteen of the counties of Pennsylvania, viz., Lebanon,\r\nCentre, Franklin, Fayette, Montgomery, Luzerne, Dauphin, Butler,\r\nAlleghany, Columbia, Northampton, Northumberland, and Philadelphia, for\r\nthe year 1830. Their population at that time consisted of 495,207\r\ninhabitants. On looking at the map of Pennsylvania, it will be seen\r\nthat these thirteen counties are scattered in every direction, and so\r\ngenerally affected by the causes which usually influence the condition\r\nof a country, that they may easily be supposed to furnish a correct\r\naverage of the financial state of the counties of Pennsylvania in\r\ngeneral; and thus, upon reckoning that the expenses of these counties\r\namounted in the year 1830 to about $361,650, or nearly 75 cents for\r\neach inhabitant, and calculating that each of them contributed in the\r\nsame year about $2.55 towards the Union, and about 75 cents to the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, it appears that they each contributed as their\r\nshare of all the public expenses (except those of the townships) the\r\nsum of $4.05. This calculation is doubly incomplete, as it applies only\r\nto a single year and to one part of the public charges; but it has at\r\nleast the merit of not being conjectural.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Federal government cannot oblige the provincial\r\ngovernments to throw any light upon this point; and even if these\r\ngovernments were inclined to afford their simultaneous co-operation, it\r\nmay be doubted whether they possess the means of procuring a\r\nsatisfactory answer. Independently of the natural difficulties of the\r\ntask, the political organization of the country would act as a\r\nhindrance to the success of their efforts. The county and town\r\nmagistrates are not appointed by the authorities of the State, and they\r\nare not subjected to their control. It is therefore very allowable to\r\nsuppose that, if the State was desirous of obtaining the returns which\r\nwe require, its design would be counteracted by the neglect of those\r\nsubordinate officers whom it would be obliged to employ. *l It is, in\r\npoint of fact, useless to inquire what the Americans might do to\r\nforward this inquiry, since it is certain that they have hitherto done\r\nnothing at all. There does not exist a single individual at the present\r\nday, in America or in Europe, who can inform us what each citizen of\r\nthe Union annually contributes to the public charges of the nation. *m\r\n[Footnote l: Those who have attempted to draw a comparison between the\r\nexpenses of France and America have at once perceived that no such\r\ncomparison could be drawn between the total expenditure of the two\r\ncountries; but they have endeavored to contrast detached portions of\r\nthis expenditure. It may readily be shown that this second system is\r\nnot at all less defective than the first. If I attempt to compare the\r\nFrench budget with the budget of the Union, it must be remembered that\r\nthe latter embraces much fewer objects than then central Government of\r\nthe former country, and that the expenditure must consequently be much\r\nsmaller. If I contrast the budgets of the Departments with those of the\r\nStates which constitute the Union, it must be observed that, as the\r\npower and control exercised by the States is much greater than that\r\nwhich is exercised by the Departments, their expenditure is also more\r\nconsiderable. As for the budgets of the counties, nothing of the kind\r\noccurs in the French system of finances; and it is, again, doubtful\r\nwhether the corresponding expenses should be referred to the budget of\r\nthe State or to those of the municipal divisions. Municipal expenses\r\nexist in both countries, but they are not always analogous. In America\r\nthe townships discharge a variety of offices which are reserved in\r\nFrance to the Departments or to the State. It may, moreover, be asked\r\nwhat is to be understood by the municipal expenses of America. The\r\norganization of the municipal bodies or townships differs in the\r\nseveral States. Are we to be guided by what occurs in New England or in\r\nGeorgia, in Pennsylvania or in the State of Illinois? A kind of analogy\r\nmay very readily be perceived between certain budgets in the two\r\ncountries; but as the elements of which they are composed always differ\r\nmore or less, no fair comparison can be instituted between them. [The\r\nsame difficulty exists, perhaps to a greater degree at the present\r\ntime, when the taxation of America has largely increased.\xe2\x80\x941874.]]\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ Even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every French and\r\nAmerican citizen to the coffers of the State, we should only come at a\r\nportion of the truth. Governments do not only demand supplies of money,\r\nbut they call for personal services, which may be looked upon as\r\nequivalent to a given sum. When a State raises an army, besides the pay\r\nof the troops, which is furnished by the entire nation, each soldier\r\nmust give up his time, the value of which depends on the use he might\r\nmake of it if he were not in the service. The same remark applies to\r\nthe militia; the citizen who is in the militia devotes a certain\r\nportion of valuable time to the maintenance of the public peace, and he\r\ndoes in reality surrender to the State those earnings which he is\r\nprevented from gaining. Many other instances might be cited in addition\r\nto these. The governments of France and of America both levy taxes of\r\nthis kind, which weigh upon the citizens; but who can estimate with\r\naccuracy their relative amount in the two countries?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us\r\nfrom comparing the expenditure of the Union with that of France. The\r\nFrench Government contracts certain obligations which do not exist in\r\nAmerica, and vice versa. The French Government pays the clergy; in\r\nAmerica the voluntary principle prevails. In America there is a legal\r\nprovision for the poor; in France they are abandoned to the charity of\r\nthe public. The French public officers are paid by a fixed salary; in\r\nAmerica they are allowed certain perquisites. In France contributions\r\nin kind take place on very few roads; in America upon almost all the\r\nthoroughfares: in the former country the roads are free to all\r\ntravellers; in the latter turnpikes abound. All these differences in\r\nthe manner in which contributions are levied in the two countries\r\nenhance the difficulty of comparing their expenditure; for there are\r\ncertain expenses which the citizens would not be subject to, or which\r\nwould at any rate be much less considerable, if the State did not take\r\nupon itself to act in the name of the public.]\r\n\r\nHence we must conclude that it is no less difficult to compare the\r\nsocial expenditure than it is to estimate the relative wealth of France\r\nand America. I will even add that it would be dangerous to attempt this\r\ncomparison; for when statistics are not based upon computations which\r\nare strictly accurate, they mislead instead of guiding aright. The mind\r\nis easily imposed upon by the false affectation of exactness, which\r\nprevails even in the misstatements of science, and it adopts with\r\nconfidence errors which are dressed in the forms of mathematical truth.\r\n\r\nWe abandon, therefore, our numerical investigation, with the hope of\r\nmeeting with data of another kind. In the absence of positive\r\ndocuments, we may form an opinion as to the proportion which the\r\ntaxation of a people bears to its real prosperity, by observing whether\r\nits external appearance is flourishing; whether, after having\r\ndischarged the calls of the State, the poor man retains the means of\r\nsubsistence, and the rich the means of enjoyment; and whether both\r\nclasses are contented with their position, seeking, however, to\r\nameliorate it by perpetual exertions, so that industry is never in want\r\nof capital, nor capital unemployed by industry. The observer who draws\r\nhis inferences from these signs will, undoubtedly, be led to the\r\nconclusion that the American of the United States contributes a much\r\nsmaller portion of his income to the State than the citizen of France.\r\nNor, indeed, can the result be otherwise.\r\n\r\nA portion of the French debt is the consequence of two successive\r\ninvasions; and the Union has no similar calamity to fear. A nation\r\nplaced upon the continent of Europe is obliged to maintain a large\r\nstanding army; the isolated position of the Union enables it to have\r\nonly 6,000 soldiers. The French have a fleet of 300 sail; the Americans\r\nhave 52 vessels. *n How, then, can the inhabitants of the Union be\r\ncalled upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitants of France? No\r\nparallel can be drawn between the finances of two countries so\r\ndifferently situated.\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ See the details in the Budget of the French Minister of Marine; and\r\nfor America, the National Calendar of 1833, p. 228. [But the public\r\ndebt of the United States in 1870, caused by the Civil War, amounted to\r\n$2,480,672,427; that of France was more than doubled by the\r\nextravagance of the Second Empire and by the war of 1870.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is by examining what actually takes place in the Union, and not by\r\ncomparing the Union with France, that we may discover whether the\r\nAmerican Government is really economical. On casting my eyes over the\r\ndifferent republics which form the confederation, I perceive that their\r\nGovernments lack perseverance in their undertakings, and that they\r\nexercise no steady control over the men whom they employ. Whence I\r\nnaturally infer that they must often spend the money of the people to\r\nno purpose, or consume more of it than is really necessary to their\r\nundertakings. Great efforts are made, in accordance with the democratic\r\norigin of society, to satisfy the exigencies of the lower orders, to\r\nopen the career of power to their endeavors, and to diffuse knowledge\r\nand comfort amongst them. The poor are maintained, immense sums are\r\nannually devoted to public instruction, all services whatsoever are\r\nremunerated, and the most subordinate agents are liberally paid. If\r\nthis kind of government appears to me to be useful and rational, I am\r\nnevertheless constrained to admit that it is expensive.\r\n\r\nWherever the poor direct public affairs and dispose of the national\r\nresources, it appears certain that, as they profit by the expenditure\r\nof the State, they are apt to augment that expenditure.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, without having recourse to inaccurate\r\ncomputations, and without hazarding a comparison which might prove\r\nincorrect, that the democratic government of the Americans is not a\r\ncheap government, as is sometimes asserted; and I have no hesitation in\r\npredicting that, if the people of the United States is ever involved in\r\nserious difficulties, its taxation will speedily be increased to the\r\nrate of that which prevails in the greater part of the aristocracies\r\nand the monarchies of Europe. *o\r\n\r\no\r\n[ [That is precisely what has since occurred.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XIII: Government Of The Democracy In America\xe2\x80\x94Part III\r\n\r\n\r\nCorruption And Vices Of The Rulers In A Democracy, And Consequent\r\nEffects Upon Public Morality\r\n\r\nIn aristocracies rulers sometimes endeavor to corrupt the people\xe2\x80\x94In\r\ndemocracies rulers frequently show themselves to be corrupt\xe2\x80\x94In the\r\nformer their vices are directly prejudicial to the morality of the\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94In the latter their indirect influence is still more pernicious.\r\n\r\nA distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the democratic\r\nprinciples mutually inveigh against each other, as tending to\r\nfacilitate corruption. In aristocratic governments the individuals who\r\nare placed at the head of affairs are rich men, who are solely desirous\r\nof power. In democracies statesmen are poor, and they have their\r\nfortunes to make. The consequence is that in aristocratic States the\r\nrulers are rarely accessible to corruption, and have very little\r\ncraving for money; whilst the reverse is the case in democratic\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nBut in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving at the head\r\nof affairs are possessed of considerable wealth, and as the number of\r\npersons by whose assistance they may rise is comparatively small, the\r\ngovernment is, if I may use the expression, put up to a sort of\r\nauction. In democracies, on the contrary, those who are covetous of\r\npower are very seldom wealthy, and the number of citizens who confer\r\nthat power is extremely great. Perhaps in democracies the number of men\r\nwho might be bought is by no means smaller, but buyers are rarely to be\r\nmet with; and, besides, it would be necessary to buy so many persons at\r\nonce that the attempt is rendered nugatory.\r\n\r\nMany of the men who have been in the administration in France during\r\nthe last forty years have been accused of making their fortunes at the\r\nexpense of the State or of its allies; a reproach which was rarely\r\naddressed to the public characters of the ancient monarchy. But in\r\nFrance the practice of bribing electors is almost unknown, whilst it is\r\nnotoriously and publicly carried on in England. In the United States I\r\nnever heard a man accused of spending his wealth in corrupting the\r\npopulace; but I have often heard the probity of public officers\r\nquestioned; still more frequently have I heard their success attributed\r\nto low intrigues and immoral practices.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the men who conduct the government of an aristocracy\r\nsometimes endeavor to corrupt the people, the heads of a democracy are\r\nthemselves corrupt. In the former case the morality of the people is\r\ndirectly assailed; in the latter an indirect influence is exercised\r\nupon the people which is still more to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nAs the rulers of democratic nations are almost always exposed to the\r\nsuspicion of dishonorable conduct, they in some measure lend the\r\nauthority of the Government to the base practices of which they are\r\naccused. They thus afford an example which must prove discouraging to\r\nthe struggles of virtuous independence, and must foster the secret\r\ncalculations of a vicious ambition. If it be asserted that evil\r\npassions are displayed in all ranks of society, that they ascend the\r\nthrone by hereditary right, and that despicable characters are to be\r\nmet with at the head of aristocratic nations as well as in the sphere\r\nof a democracy, this objection has but little weight in my estimation.\r\nThe corruption of men who have casually risen to power has a coarse and\r\nvulgar infection in it which renders it contagious to the multitude. On\r\nthe contrary, there is a kind of aristocratic refinement and an air of\r\ngrandeur in the depravity of the great, which frequently prevent it\r\nfrom spreading abroad.\r\n\r\nThe people can never penetrate into the perplexing labyrinth of court\r\nintrigue, and it will always have difficulty in detecting the turpitude\r\nwhich lurks under elegant manners, refined tastes, and graceful\r\nlanguage. But to pillage the public purse, and to vend the favors of\r\nthe State, are arts which the meanest villain may comprehend, and hope\r\nto practice in his turn.\r\n\r\nIn reality it is far less prejudicial to witness the immorality of the\r\ngreat than to witness that immorality which leads to greatness. In a\r\ndemocracy private citizens see a man of their own rank in life, who\r\nrises from that obscure position, and who becomes possessed of riches\r\nand of power in a few years; the spectacle excites their surprise and\r\ntheir envy, and they are led to inquire how the person who was\r\nyesterday their equal is to-day their ruler. To attribute his rise to\r\nhis talents or his virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to\r\nacknowledge that they are themselves less virtuous and less talented\r\nthan he was. They are therefore led (and not unfrequently their\r\nconjecture is a correct one) to impute his success mainly to some one\r\nof his defects; and an odious mixture is thus formed of the ideas of\r\nturpitude and power, unworthiness and success, utility and dishonor.\r\n\r\nEfforts Of Which A Democracy Is Capable\r\n\r\nThe Union has only had one struggle hitherto for its\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94Enthusiasm at the commencement of the war\xe2\x80\x94Indifference\r\ntowards its close\xe2\x80\x94Difficulty of establishing military conscription or\r\nimpressment of seamen in America\xe2\x80\x94Why a democratic people is less\r\ncapable of sustained effort than another.\r\n\r\nI here warn the reader that I speak of a government which implicitly\r\nfollows the real desires of a people, and not of a government which\r\nsimply commands in its name. Nothing is so irresistible as a tyrannical\r\npower commanding in the name of the people, because, whilst it\r\nexercises that moral influence which belongs to the decision of the\r\nmajority, it acts at the same time with the promptitude and the\r\ntenacity of a single man.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what degree of exertion a democratic government\r\nmay be capable of making a crisis in the history of the nation. But no\r\ngreat democratic republic has hitherto existed in the world. To style\r\nthe oligarchy which ruled over France in 1793 by that name would be to\r\noffer an insult to the republican form of government. The United States\r\nafford the first example of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe American Union has now subsisted for half a century, in the course\r\nof which time its existence has only once been attacked, namely, during\r\nthe War of Independence. At the commencement of that long war, various\r\noccurrences took place which betokened an extraordinary zeal for the\r\nservice of the country. *p But as the contest was prolonged, symptoms\r\nof private egotism began to show themselves. No money was poured into\r\nthe public treasury; few recruits could be raised to join the army; the\r\npeople wished to acquire independence, but was very ill-disposed to\r\nundergo the privations by which alone it could be obtained. \xe2\x80\x9cTax laws,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Hamilton in the \xe2\x80\x9cFederalist\xe2\x80\x9d (No. 12), \xe2\x80\x9chave in vain been\r\nmultiplied; new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been\r\ntried; the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed and the\r\ntreasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular system of\r\nadministration inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding\r\nwith the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated\r\nstate of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive\r\ncollections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the\r\nfolly of attempting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\np\r\n[ One of the most singular of these occurrences was the resolution\r\nwhich the Americans took of temporarily abandoning the use of tea.\r\nThose who know that men usually cling more to their habits than to\r\ntheir life will doubtless admire this great though obscure sacrifice\r\nwhich was made by a whole people.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States have not had any serious war to carry on ever since\r\nthat period. In order, therefore, to appreciate the sacrifices which\r\ndemocratic nations may impose upon themselves, we must wait until the\r\nAmerican people is obliged to put half its entire income at the\r\ndisposal of the Government, as was done by the English; or until it\r\nsends forth a twentieth part of its population to the field of battle,\r\nas was done by France. *q\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ [The Civil War showed that when the necessity arose the American\r\npeople, both in the North and in the South, are capable of making the\r\nmost enormous sacrifices, both in money and in men.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America the use of conscription is unknown, and men are induced to\r\nenlist by bounties. The notions and habits of the people of the United\r\nStates are so opposed to compulsory enlistment that I do not imagine it\r\ncan ever be sanctioned by the laws. What is termed the conscription in\r\nFrance is assuredly the heaviest tax upon the population of that\r\ncountry; yet how could a great continental war be carried on without\r\nit? The Americans have not adopted the British impressment of seamen,\r\nand they have nothing which corresponds to the French system of\r\nmaritime conscription; the navy, as well as the merchant service, is\r\nsupplied by voluntary service. But it is not easy to conceive how a\r\npeople can sustain a great maritime war without having recourse to one\r\nor the other of these two systems. Indeed, the Union, which has fought\r\nwith some honor upon the seas, has never possessed a very numerous\r\nfleet, and the equipment of the small number of American vessels has\r\nalways been excessively expensive.\r\n\r\nI have heard American statesmen confess that the Union will have great\r\ndifficulty in maintaining its rank on the seas without adopting the\r\nsystem of impressment or of maritime conscription; but the difficulty\r\nis to induce the people, which exercises the supreme authority, to\r\nsubmit to impressment or any compulsory system.\r\n\r\nIt is incontestable that in times of danger a free people displays far\r\nmore energy than one which is not so. But I incline to believe that\r\nthis is more especially the case in those free nations in which the\r\ndemocratic element preponderates. Democracy appears to me to be much\r\nbetter adapted for the peaceful conduct of society, or for an\r\noccasional effort of remarkable vigor, than for the hardy and prolonged\r\nendurance of the storms which beset the political existence of nations.\r\nThe reason is very evident; it is enthusiasm which prompts men to\r\nexpose themselves to dangers and privations, but they will not support\r\nthem long without reflection. There is more calculation, even in the\r\nimpulses of bravery, than is generally attributed to them; and although\r\nthe first efforts are suggested by passion, perseverance is maintained\r\nby a distinct regard of the purpose in view. A portion of what we value\r\nis exposed, in order to save the remainder.\r\n\r\nBut it is this distinct perception of the future, founded upon a sound\r\njudgment and an enlightened experience, which is most frequently\r\nwanting in democracies. The populace is more apt to feel than to\r\nreason; and if its present sufferings are great, it is to be feared\r\nthat the still greater sufferings attendant upon defeat will be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAnother cause tends to render the efforts of a democratic government\r\nless persevering than those of an aristocracy. Not only are the lower\r\nclasses less awakened than the higher orders to the good or evil\r\nchances of the future, but they are liable to suffer far more acutely\r\nfrom present privations. The noble exposes his life, indeed, but the\r\nchance of glory is equal to the chance of harm. If he sacrifices a\r\nlarge portion of his income to the State, he deprives himself for a\r\ntime of the pleasures of affluence; but to the poor man death is\r\nembellished by no pomp or renown, and the imposts which are irksome to\r\nthe rich are fatal to him.\r\n\r\nThis relative impotence of democratic republics is, perhaps, the\r\ngreatest obstacle to the foundation of a republic of this kind in\r\nEurope. In order that such a State should subsist in one country of the\r\nOld World, it would be necessary that similar institutions should be\r\nintroduced into all the other nations.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that a democratic government tends in the end to\r\nincrease the real strength of society; but it can never combine, upon a\r\nsingle point and at a given time, so much power as an aristocracy or a\r\nmonarchy. If a democratic country remained during a whole century\r\nsubject to a republican government, it would probably at the end of\r\nthat period be more populous and more prosperous than the neighboring\r\ndespotic States. But it would have incurred the risk of being conquered\r\nmuch oftener than they would in that lapse of years.\r\n\r\nSelf-Control Of The American Democracy\r\n\r\nThe American people acquiesces slowly, or frequently does not\r\nacquiesce, in what is beneficial to its interests\xe2\x80\x94The faults of the\r\nAmerican democracy are for the most part reparable.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which a democracy has in conquering the passions and in\r\nsubduing the exigencies of the moment, with a view to the future, is\r\nconspicuous in the most trivial occurrences of the United States. The\r\npeople, which is surrounded by flatterers, has great difficulty in\r\nsurmounting its inclinations, and whenever it is solicited to undergo a\r\nprivation or any kind of inconvenience, even to attain an end which is\r\nsanctioned by its own rational conviction, it almost always refuses to\r\ncomply at first. The deference of the Americans to the laws has been\r\nvery justly applauded; but it must be added that in America the\r\nlegislation is made by the people and for the people. Consequently, in\r\nthe United States the law favors those classes which are most\r\ninterested in evading it elsewhere. It may therefore be supposed that\r\nan offensive law, which should not be acknowledged to be one of\r\nimmediate utility, would either not be enacted or would not be obeyed.\r\n\r\nIn America there is no law against fraudulent bankruptcies; not because\r\nthey are few, but because there are a great number of bankruptcies. The\r\ndread of being prosecuted as a bankrupt acts with more intensity upon\r\nthe mind of the majority of the people than the fear of being involved\r\nin losses or ruin by the failure of other parties, and a sort of guilty\r\ntolerance is extended by the public conscience to an offence which\r\neveryone condemns in his individual capacity. In the new States of the\r\nSouthwest the citizens generally take justice into their own hands, and\r\nmurders are of very frequent occurrence. This arises from the rude\r\nmanners and the ignorance of the inhabitants of those deserts, who do\r\nnot perceive the utility of investing the law with adequate force, and\r\nwho prefer duels to prosecutions.\r\n\r\nSomeone observed to me one day, in Philadelphia, that almost all crimes\r\nin America are caused by the abuse of intoxicating liquors, which the\r\nlower classes can procure in great abundance, from their excessive\r\ncheapness. \xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you do not put a duty upon\r\nbrandy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOur legislators,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined my informant, \xe2\x80\x9chave frequently\r\nthought of this expedient; but the task of putting it in operation is a\r\ndifficult one; a revolt might be apprehended, and the members who\r\nshould vote for a law of this kind would be sure of losing their\r\nseats.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhence I am to infer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the drinking\r\npopulation constitutes the majority in your country, and that\r\ntemperance is somewhat unpopular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen these things are pointed out to the American statesmen, they\r\ncontent themselves with assuring you that time will operate the\r\nnecessary change, and that the experience of evil will teach the people\r\nits true interests. This is frequently true, although a democracy is\r\nmore liable to error than a monarch or a body of nobles; the chances of\r\nits regaining the right path when once it has acknowledged its mistake,\r\nare greater also; because it is rarely embarrassed by internal\r\ninterests, which conflict with those of the majority, and resist the\r\nauthority of reason. But a democracy can only obtain truth as the\r\nresult of experience, and many nations may forfeit their existence\r\nwhilst they are awaiting the consequences of their errors.\r\n\r\nThe great privilege of the Americans does not simply consist in their\r\nbeing more enlightened than other nations, but in their being able to\r\nrepair the faults they may commit. To which it must be added, that a\r\ndemocracy cannot derive substantial benefit from past experience,\r\nunless it be arrived at a certain pitch of knowledge and civilization.\r\nThere are tribes and peoples whose education has been so vicious, and\r\nwhose character presents so strange a mixture of passion, of ignorance,\r\nand of erroneous notions upon all subjects, that they are unable to\r\ndiscern the causes of their own wretchedness, and they fall a sacrifice\r\nto ills with which they are unacquainted.\r\n\r\nI have crossed vast tracts of country that were formerly inhabited by\r\npowerful Indian nations which are now extinct; I have myself passed\r\nsome time in the midst of mutilated tribes, which witness the daily\r\ndecline of their numerical strength and of the glory of their\r\nindependence; and I have heard these Indians themselves anticipate the\r\nimpending doom of their race. Every European can perceive means which\r\nwould rescue these unfortunate beings from inevitable destruction. They\r\nalone are insensible to the expedient; they feel the woe which year\r\nafter year heaps upon their heads, but they will perish to a man\r\nwithout accepting the remedy. It would be necessary to employ force to\r\ninduce them to submit to the protection and the constraint of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe incessant revolutions which have convulsed the South American\r\nprovinces for the last quarter of a century have frequently been\r\nadverted to with astonishment, and expectations have been expressed\r\nthat those nations would speedily return to their natural state. But\r\ncan it be affirmed that the turmoil of revolution is not actually the\r\nmost natural state of the South American Spaniards at the present time?\r\nIn that country society is plunged into difficulties from which all its\r\nefforts are insufficient to rescue it. The inhabitants of that fair\r\nportion of the Western Hemisphere seem obstinately bent on pursuing the\r\nwork of inward havoc. If they fall into a momentary repose from the\r\neffects of exhaustion, that repose prepares them for a fresh state of\r\nfrenzy. When I consider their condition, which alternates between\r\nmisery and crime, I should be inclined to believe that despotism itself\r\nwould be a benefit to them, if it were possible that the words\r\ndespotism and benefit could ever be united in my mind.\r\n\r\nConduct Of Foreign Affairs By The American Democracy\r\n\r\nDirection given to the foreign policy of the United States by\r\nWashington and Jefferson\xe2\x80\x94Almost all the defects inherent in democratic\r\ninstitutions are brought to light in the conduct of foreign\r\naffairs\xe2\x80\x94Their advantages are less perceptible.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Federal Constitution entrusts the permanent\r\ndirection of the external interests of the nation to the President and\r\nthe Senate, *r which tends in some degree to detach the general foreign\r\npolicy of the Union from the control of the people. It cannot therefore\r\nbe asserted with truth that the external affairs of State are conducted\r\nby the democracy.\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cThe President,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Constitution, Art. II, sect. 2, Section 2,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to\r\nmake treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nreader is reminded that the senators are returned for a term of six\r\nyears, and that they are chosen by the legislature of each State.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy of America owes its rise to Washington, and after him to\r\nJefferson, who established those principles which it observes at the\r\npresent day. Washington said in the admirable letter which he addressed\r\nto his fellow-citizens, and which may be looked upon as his political\r\nbequest to the country: \xe2\x80\x9cThe great rule of conduct for us in regard to\r\nforeign nations is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with\r\nthem as little political connection as possible. So far as we have\r\nalready formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good\r\nfaith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to\r\nus have none, or a very remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in\r\nfrequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to\r\nour concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate\r\nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her\r\npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her\r\nfriendships or enmities. Our detached and distant situation invites and\r\nenables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under\r\nan efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy\r\nmaterial injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an\r\nattitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon\r\nto be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the\r\nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard\r\nthe giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our\r\ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel. Why forego the advantages\r\nof so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign\r\nground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of\r\nEurope, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European\r\nambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? It is our true policy\r\nto steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign\r\nworld; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me\r\nnot be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing\r\nengagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to\r\nprivate affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it;\r\ntherefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense;\r\nbut in my opinion it is unnecessary, and would be unwise, to extend\r\nthem. Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments,\r\nin a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\r\nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\xe2\x80\x9d In a previous part of the\r\nsame letter Washington makes the following admirable and just remark:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred or an\r\nhabitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its\r\nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it\r\nastray from its duty and its interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe political conduct of Washington was always guided by these maxims.\r\nHe succeeded in maintaining his country in a state of peace whilst all\r\nthe other nations of the globe were at war; and he laid it down as a\r\nfundamental doctrine, that the true interest of the Americans consisted\r\nin a perfect neutrality with regard to the internal dissensions of the\r\nEuropean Powers.\r\n\r\nJefferson went still further, and he introduced a maxim into the policy\r\nof the Union, which affirms that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Americans ought never to solicit\r\nany privileges from foreign nations, in order not to be obliged to\r\ngrant similar privileges themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese two principles, which were so plain and so just as to be adapted\r\nto the capacity of the populace, have greatly simplified the foreign\r\npolicy of the United States. As the Union takes no part in the affairs\r\nof Europe, it has, properly speaking, no foreign interests to discuss,\r\nsince it has at present no powerful neighbors on the American\r\ncontinent. The country is as much removed from the passions of the Old\r\nWorld by its position as by the line of policy which it has chosen, and\r\nit is neither called upon to repudiate nor to espouse the conflicting\r\ninterests of Europe; whilst the dissensions of the New World are still\r\nconcealed within the bosom of the future.\r\n\r\nThe Union is free from all pre-existing obligations, and it is\r\nconsequently enabled to profit by the experience of the old nations of\r\nEurope, without being obliged, as they are, to make the best of the\r\npast, and to adapt it to their present circumstances; or to accept that\r\nimmense inheritance which they derive from their forefathers\xe2\x80\x94an\r\ninheritance of glory mingled with calamities, and of alliances\r\nconflicting with national antipathies. The foreign policy of the United\r\nStates is reduced by its very nature to await the chances of the future\r\nhistory of the nation, and for the present it consists more in\r\nabstaining from interference than in exerting its activity.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore very difficult to ascertain, at present, what degree of\r\nsagacity the American democracy will display in the conduct of the\r\nforeign policy of the country; and upon this point its adversaries, as\r\nwell as its advocates, must suspend their judgment. As for myself I\r\nhave no hesitation in avowing my conviction, that it is most especially\r\nin the conduct of foreign relations that democratic governments appear\r\nto me to be decidedly inferior to governments carried on upon different\r\nprinciples. Experience, instruction, and habit may almost always\r\nsucceed in creating a species of practical discretion in democracies,\r\nand that science of the daily occurrences of life which is called good\r\nsense. Good sense may suffice to direct the ordinary course of society;\r\nand amongst a people whose education has been provided for, the\r\nadvantages of democratic liberty in the internal affairs of the country\r\nmay more than compensate for the evils inherent in a democratic\r\ngovernment. But such is not always the case in the mutual relations of\r\nforeign nations.\r\n\r\nForeign politics demand scarcely any of those qualities which a\r\ndemocracy possesses; and they require, on the contrary, the perfect use\r\nof almost all those faculties in which it is deficient. Democracy is\r\nfavorable to the increase of the internal resources of the State; it\r\ntends to diffuse a moderate independence; it promotes the growth of\r\npublic spirit, and fortifies the respect which is entertained for law\r\nin all classes of society; and these are advantages which only exercise\r\nan indirect influence over the relations which one people bears to\r\nanother. But a democracy is unable to regulate the details of an\r\nimportant undertaking, to persevere in a design, and to work out its\r\nexecution in the presence of serious obstacles. It cannot combine its\r\nmeasures with secrecy, and it will not await their consequences with\r\npatience. These are qualities which more especially belong to an\r\nindividual or to an aristocracy; and they are precisely the means by\r\nwhich an individual people attains to a predominant position.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, we observe the natural defects of aristocracy, we\r\nshall find that their influence is comparatively innoxious in the\r\ndirection of the external affairs of a State. The capital fault of\r\nwhich aristocratic bodies may be accused is that they are more apt to\r\ncontrive their own advantage than that of the mass of the people. In\r\nforeign politics it is rare for the interest of the aristocracy to be\r\nin any way distinct from that of the people.\r\n\r\nThe propensity which democracies have to obey the impulse of passion\r\nrather than the suggestions of prudence, and to abandon a mature design\r\nfor the gratification of a momentary caprice, was very clearly seen in\r\nAmerica on the breaking out of the French Revolution. It was then as\r\nevident to the simplest capacity as it is at the present time that the\r\ninterest of the Americans forbade them to take any part in the contest\r\nwhich was about to deluge Europe with blood, but which could by no\r\nmeans injure the welfare of their own country. Nevertheless the\r\nsympathies of the people declared themselves with so much violence in\r\nbehalf of France that nothing but the inflexible character of\r\nWashington, and the immense popularity which he enjoyed, could have\r\nprevented the Americans from declaring war against England. And even\r\nthen, the exertions which the austere reason of that great man made to\r\nrepress the generous but imprudent passions of his fellow-citizens,\r\nvery nearly deprived him of the sole recompense which he had ever\r\nclaimed\xe2\x80\x94that of his country\xe2\x80\x99s love. The majority then reprobated the\r\nline of policy which he adopted, and which has since been unanimously\r\napproved by the nation. *s If the Constitution and the favor of the\r\npublic had not entrusted the direction of the foreign affairs of the\r\ncountry to Washington, it is certain that the American nation would at\r\nthat time have taken the very measures which it now condemns.\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ See the fifth volume of Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLife of Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d In a\r\ngovernment constituted like that of the United States, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\nimpossible for the chief magistrate, however firm he may be, to oppose\r\nfor any length of time the torrent of popular opinion; and the\r\nprevalent opinion of that day seemed to incline to war. In fact, in the\r\nsession of Congress held at the time, it was frequently seen that\r\nWashington had lost the majority in the House of Representatives.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nviolence of the language used against him in public was extreme, and in\r\na political meeting they did not scruple to compare him indirectly to\r\nthe treacherous Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the opposition,\xe2\x80\x9d says Marshall, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nfriends of the administration were declared to be an aristocratic and\r\ncorrupt faction, who, from a desire to introduce monarchy, were hostile\r\nto France and under the influence of Britain; that they were a paper\r\nnobility, whose extreme sensibility at every measure which threatened\r\nthe funds, induced a tame submission to injuries and insults, which the\r\ninterests and honor of the nation required them to resist.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all the nations which have ever exercised a powerful influence\r\nupon the destinies of the world by conceiving, following up, and\r\nexecuting vast designs\xe2\x80\x94from the Romans to the English\xe2\x80\x94have been\r\ngoverned by aristocratic institutions. Nor will this be a subject of\r\nwonder when we recollect that nothing in the world has so absolute a\r\nfixity of purpose as an aristocracy. The mass of the people may be led\r\nastray by ignorance or passion; the mind of a king may be biased, and\r\nhis perseverance in his designs may be shaken\xe2\x80\x94besides which a king is\r\nnot immortal\xe2\x80\x94but an aristocratic body is too numerous to be led astray\r\nby the blandishments of intrigue, and yet not numerous enough to yield\r\nreadily to the intoxicating influence of unreflecting passion: it has\r\nthe energy of a firm and enlightened individual, added to the power\r\nwhich it derives from perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XIV: Advantages American Society Derive From Democracy\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat The Real Advantages Are Which American Society Derives From The\r\nGovernment Of The Democracy\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon the subject of the present chapter I am induced to\r\nremind the reader of what I have more than once adverted to in the\r\ncourse of this book. The political institutions of the United States\r\nappear to me to be one of the forms of government which a democracy may\r\nadopt; but I do not regard the American Constitution as the best, or as\r\nthe only one, which a democratic people may establish. In showing the\r\nadvantages which the Americans derive from the government of democracy,\r\nI am therefore very far from meaning, or from believing, that similar\r\nadvantages can only be obtained from the same laws.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tendency Of The Laws Under The Rule Of The American Democracy,\r\nAnd Habits Of Those Who Apply Them\r\n\r\nDefects of a democratic government easy to be discovered\xe2\x80\x94Its advantages\r\nonly to be discerned by long observation\xe2\x80\x94Democracy in America often\r\ninexpert, but the general tendency of the laws advantageous\xe2\x80\x94In the\r\nAmerican democracy public officers have no permanent interests distinct\r\nfrom those of the majority\xe2\x80\x94Result of this state of things.\r\n\r\nThe defects and the weaknesses of a democratic government may very\r\nreadily be discovered; they are demonstrated by the most flagrant\r\ninstances, whilst its beneficial influence is less perceptibly\r\nexercised. A single glance suffices to detect its evil consequences,\r\nbut its good qualities can only be discerned by long observation. The\r\nlaws of the American democracy are frequently defective or incomplete;\r\nthey sometimes attack vested rights, or give a sanction to others which\r\nare dangerous to the community; but even if they were good, the\r\nfrequent changes which they undergo would be an evil. How comes it,\r\nthen, that the American republics prosper and maintain their position?\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of laws a distinction must be carefully observed\r\nbetween the end at which they aim and the means by which they are\r\ndirected to that end, between their absolute and their relative\r\nexcellence. If it be the intention of the legislator to favor the\r\ninterests of the minority at the expense of the majority, and if the\r\nmeasures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the object he has in\r\nview with the least possible expense of time and exertion, the law may\r\nbe well drawn up, although its purpose be bad; and the more efficacious\r\nit is, the greater is the mischief which it causes.\r\n\r\nDemocratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest\r\npossible number; for they emanate from the majority of the citizens,\r\nwho are subject to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to\r\ntheir own advantage. The laws of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary,\r\nto concentrate wealth and power in the hands of the minority, because\r\nan aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes a minority. It may\r\ntherefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the purpose of a\r\ndemocracy in the conduct of its legislation is useful to a greater\r\nnumber of citizens than that of an aristocracy. This is, however, the\r\nsum total of its advantages.\r\n\r\nAristocracies are infinitely more expert in the science of legislation\r\nthan democracies ever can be. They are possessed of a self-control\r\nwhich protects them from the errors of temporary excitement, and they\r\nform lasting designs which they mature with the assistance of favorable\r\nopportunities. Aristocratic government proceeds with the dexterity of\r\nart; it understands how to make the collective force of all its laws\r\nconverge at the same time to a given point. Such is not the case with\r\ndemocracies, whose laws are almost always ineffective or inopportune.\r\nThe means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those of\r\naristocracy, and the measures which it unwittingly adopts are\r\nfrequently opposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is\r\nmore useful.\r\n\r\nLet us now imagine a community so organized by nature, or by its\r\nconstitution, that it can support the transitory action of bad laws,\r\nand that it can await, without destruction, the general tendency of the\r\nlegislation: we shall then be able to conceive that a democratic\r\ngovernment, notwithstanding its defects, will be most fitted to conduce\r\nto the prosperity of this community. This is precisely what has\r\noccurred in the United States; and I repeat, what I have before\r\nremarked, that the great advantage of the Americans consists in their\r\nbeing able to commit faults which they may afterward repair.\r\n\r\nAn analogous observation may be made respecting public officers. It is\r\neasy to perceive that the American democracy frequently errs in the\r\nchoice of the individuals to whom it entrusts the power of the\r\nadministration; but it is more difficult to say why the State prospers\r\nunder their rule. In the first place it is to be remarked, that if in a\r\ndemocratic State the governors have less honesty and less capacity than\r\nelsewhere, the governed, on the other hand, are more enlightened and\r\nmore attentive to their interests. As the people in democracies is more\r\nincessantly vigilant in its affairs and more jealous of its rights, it\r\nprevents its representatives from abandoning that general line of\r\nconduct which its own interest prescribes. In the second place, it must\r\nbe remembered that if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse\r\nhis power, he possesses it for a shorter period of time. But there is\r\nyet another reason which is still more general and conclusive. It is no\r\ndoubt of importance to the welfare of nations that they should be\r\ngoverned by men of talents and virtue; but it is perhaps still more\r\nimportant that the interests of those men should not differ from the\r\ninterests of the community at large; for, if such were the case,\r\nvirtues of a high order might become useless, and talents might be\r\nturned to a bad account. I say that it is important that the interests\r\nof the persons in authority should not conflict with or oppose the\r\ninterests of the community at large; but I do not insist upon their\r\nhaving the same interests as the whole population, because I am not\r\naware that such a state of things ever existed in any country.\r\n\r\nNo political form has hitherto been discovered which is equally\r\nfavorable to the prosperity and the development of all the classes into\r\nwhich society is divided. These classes continue to form, as it were, a\r\ncertain number of distinct nations in the same nation; and experience\r\nhas shown that it is no less dangerous to place the fate of these\r\nclasses exclusively in the hands of any one of them than it is to make\r\none people the arbiter of the destiny of another. When the rich alone\r\ngovern, the interest of the poor is always endangered; and when the\r\npoor make the laws, that of the rich incurs very serious risks. The\r\nadvantage of democracy does not consist, therefore, as has sometimes\r\nbeen asserted, in favoring the prosperity of all, but simply in\r\ncontributing to the well-being of the greatest possible number.\r\n\r\nThe men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in the\r\nUnited States are frequently inferior, both in point of capacity and of\r\nmorality, to those whom aristocratic institutions would raise to power.\r\nBut their interest is identified and confounded with that of the\r\nmajority of their fellow-citizens. They may frequently be faithless and\r\nfrequently mistaken, but they will never systematically adopt a line of\r\nconduct opposed to the will of the majority; and it is impossible that\r\nthey should give a dangerous or an exclusive tendency to the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated\r\nfact, which only occurs during the short period for which he is\r\nelected. Corruption and incapacity do not act as common interests,\r\nwhich may connect men permanently with one another. A corrupt or an\r\nincapable magistrate will not concert his measures with another\r\nmagistrate, simply because that individual is as corrupt and as\r\nincapable as himself; and these two men will never unite their\r\nendeavors to promote the corruption and inaptitude of their remote\r\nposterity. The ambition and the manoeuvres of the one will serve, on\r\nthe contrary, to unmask the other. The vices of a magistrate, in\r\ndemocratic states, are usually peculiar to his own person.\r\n\r\nBut under aristocratic governments public men are swayed by the\r\ninterest of their order, which, if it is sometimes confounded with the\r\ninterests of the majority, is very frequently distinct from them. This\r\ninterest is the common and lasting bond which unites them together; it\r\ninduces them to coalesce, and to combine their efforts in order to\r\nattain an end which does not always ensure the greatest happiness of\r\nthe greatest number; and it serves not only to connect the persons in\r\nauthority, but to unite them to a considerable portion of the\r\ncommunity, since a numerous body of citizens belongs to the\r\naristocracy, without being invested with official functions. The\r\naristocratic magistrate is therefore constantly supported by a portion\r\nof the community, as well as by the Government of which he is a member.\r\n\r\nThe common purpose which connects the interest of the magistrates in\r\naristocracies with that of a portion of their contemporaries identifies\r\nit with that of future generations; their influence belongs to the\r\nfuture as much as to the present. The aristocratic magistrate is urged\r\nat the same time toward the same point by the passions of the\r\ncommunity, by his own, and I may almost add by those of his posterity.\r\nIs it, then, wonderful that he does not resist such repeated impulses?\r\nAnd indeed aristocracies are often carried away by the spirit of their\r\norder without being corrupted by it; and they unconsciously fashion\r\nsociety to their own ends, and prepare it for their own descendants.\r\n\r\nThe English aristocracy is perhaps the most liberal which ever existed,\r\nand no body of men has ever, uninterruptedly, furnished so many\r\nhonorable and enlightened individuals to the government of a country.\r\nIt cannot, however, escape observation that in the legislation of\r\nEngland the good of the poor has been sacrificed to the advantage of\r\nthe rich, and the rights of the majority to the privileges of the few.\r\nThe consequence is, that England, at the present day, combines the\r\nextremes of fortune in the bosom of her society, and her perils and\r\ncalamities are almost equal to her power and her renown. *a\r\n\r\na\r\n[ [The legislation of England for the forty years is certainly not\r\nfairly open to this criticism, which was written before the Reform Bill\r\nof 1832, and accordingly Great Britain has thus far escaped and\r\nsurmounted the perils and calamities to which she seemed to be\r\nexposed.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, where the public officers have no interests to\r\npromote connected with their caste, the general and constant influence\r\nof the Government is beneficial, although the individuals who conduct\r\nit are frequently unskilful and sometimes contemptible. There is indeed\r\na secret tendency in democratic institutions to render the exertions of\r\nthe citizens subservient to the prosperity of the community,\r\nnotwithstanding their private vices and mistakes; whilst in\r\naristocratic institutions there is a secret propensity which,\r\nnotwithstanding the talents and the virtues of those who conduct the\r\ngovernment, leads them to contribute to the evils which oppress their\r\nfellow-creatures. In aristocratic governments public men may frequently\r\ndo injuries which they do not intend, and in democratic states they\r\nproduce advantages which they never thought of.\r\n\r\nPublic Spirit In The United States\r\n\r\nPatriotism of instinct\xe2\x80\x94Patriotism of reflection\xe2\x80\x94Their different\r\ncharacteristics\xe2\x80\x94Nations ought to strive to acquire the second when the\r\nfirst has disappeared\xe2\x80\x94Efforts of the Americans to it\xe2\x80\x94Interest of the\r\nindividual intimately connected with that of the country.\r\n\r\nThere is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally arises from\r\nthat instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable feeling which connects\r\nthe affections of man with his birthplace. This natural fondness is\r\nunited to a taste for ancient customs, and to a reverence for ancestral\r\ntraditions of the past; those who cherish it love their country as they\r\nlove the mansions of their fathers. They enjoy the tranquillity which\r\nit affords them; they cling to the peaceful habits which they have\r\ncontracted within its bosom; they are attached to the reminiscences\r\nwhich it awakens, and they are even pleased by the state of obedience\r\nin which they are placed. This patriotism is sometimes stimulated by\r\nreligious enthusiasm, and then it is capable of making the most\r\nprodigious efforts. It is in itself a kind of religion; it does not\r\nreason, but it acts from the impulse of faith and of sentiment. By some\r\nnations the monarch has been regarded as a personification of the\r\ncountry; and the fervor of patriotism being converted into the fervor\r\nof loyalty, they took a sympathetic pride in his conquests, and gloried\r\nin his power. At one time, under the ancient monarchy, the French felt\r\na sort of satisfaction in the sense of their dependence upon the\r\narbitrary pleasure of their king, and they were wont to say with pride,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are the subjects of the most powerful king in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, like all instinctive passions, this kind of patriotism is more apt\r\nto prompt transient exertion than to supply the motives of continuous\r\nendeavor. It may save the State in critical circumstances, but it will\r\nnot unfrequently allow the nation to decline in the midst of peace.\r\nWhilst the manners of a people are simple and its faith unshaken,\r\nwhilst society is steadily based upon traditional institutions whose\r\nlegitimacy has never been contested, this instinctive patriotism is\r\nwont to endure.\r\n\r\nBut there is another species of attachment to a country which is more\r\nrational than the one we have been describing. It is perhaps less\r\ngenerous and less ardent, but it is more fruitful and more lasting; it\r\nis coeval with the spread of knowledge, it is nurtured by the laws, it\r\ngrows by the exercise of civil rights, and, in the end, it is\r\nconfounded with the personal interest of the citizen. A man comprehends\r\nthe influence which the prosperity of his country has upon his own\r\nwelfare; he is aware that the laws authorize him to contribute his\r\nassistance to that prosperity, and he labors to promote it as a portion\r\nof his interest in the first place, and as a portion of his right in\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nBut epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation,\r\nat which the ancient customs of a people are changed, public morality\r\ndestroyed, religious belief disturbed, and the spell of tradition\r\nbroken, whilst the diffusion of knowledge is yet imperfect, and the\r\ncivil rights of the community are ill secured, or confined within very\r\nnarrow limits. The country then assumes a dim and dubious shape in the\r\neyes of the citizens; they no longer behold it in the soil which they\r\ninhabit, for that soil is to them a dull inanimate clod; nor in the\r\nusages of their forefathers, which they have been taught to look upon\r\nas a debasing yoke; nor in religion, for of that they doubt; nor in the\r\nlaws, which do not originate in their own authority; nor in the\r\nlegislator, whom they fear and despise. The country is lost to their\r\nsenses, they can neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed\r\nfeatures, and they entrench themselves within the dull precincts of a\r\nnarrow egotism. They are emancipated from prejudice without having\r\nacknowledged the empire of reason; they are neither animated by the\r\ninstinctive patriotism of monarchical subjects nor by the thinking\r\npatriotism of republican citizens; but they have stopped halfway\r\nbetween the two, in the midst of confusion and of distress.\r\n\r\nIn this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people cannot\r\nrestore the vivacity of its earlier times, any more than a man can\r\nreturn to the innocence and the bloom of childhood; such things may be\r\nregretted, but they cannot be renewed. The only thing, then, which\r\nremains to be done is to proceed, and to accelerate the union of\r\nprivate with public interests, since the period of disinterested\r\npatriotism is gone by forever.\r\n\r\nI am certainly very far from averring that, in order to obtain this\r\nresult, the exercise of political rights should be immediately granted\r\nto all the members of the community. But I maintain that the most\r\npowerful, and perhaps the only, means of interesting men in the welfare\r\nof their country which we still possess is to make them partakers in\r\nthe Government. At the present time civic zeal seems to me to be\r\ninseparable from the exercise of political rights; and I hold that the\r\nnumber of citizens will be found to augment or to decrease in Europe in\r\nproportion as those rights are extended.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon\r\nthe soil which they now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor\r\ntraditions with them there; they meet each other for the first time\r\nwith no previous acquaintance; in short, the instinctive love of their\r\ncountry can scarcely exist in their minds; but everyone takes as\r\nzealous an interest in the affairs of his township, his county, and of\r\nthe whole State, as if they were his own, because everyone, in his\r\nsphere, takes an active part in the government of society.\r\n\r\nThe lower orders in the United States are alive to the perception of\r\nthe influence exercised by the general prosperity upon their own\r\nwelfare; and simple as this observation is, it is one which is but too\r\nrarely made by the people. But in America the people regards this\r\nprosperity as the result of its own exertions; the citizen looks upon\r\nthe fortune of the public as his private interest, and he co-operates\r\nin its success, not so much from a sense of pride or of duty, as from\r\nwhat I shall venture to term cupidity.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history of the\r\nAmericans in order to discover the truth of this remark, for their\r\nmanners render it sufficiently evident. As the American participates in\r\nall that is done in his country, he thinks himself obliged to defend\r\nwhatever may be censured; for it is not only his country which is\r\nattacked upon these occasions, but it is himself. The consequence is,\r\nthat his national pride resorts to a thousand artifices, and to all the\r\npetty tricks of individual vanity.\r\n\r\nNothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life than\r\nthis irritable patriotism of the Americans. A stranger may be very well\r\ninclined to praise many of the institutions of their country, but he\r\nbegs permission to blame some of the peculiarities which he observes\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npermission which is, however, inexorably refused. America is therefore\r\na free country, in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks,\r\nyou are not allowed to speak freely of private individuals, or of the\r\nState, of the citizens or of the authorities, of public or of private\r\nundertakings, or, in short, of anything at all, except it be of the\r\nclimate and the soil; and even then Americans will be found ready to\r\ndefend either the one or the other, as if they had been contrived by\r\nthe inhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\nIn our times option must be made between the patriotism of all and the\r\ngovernment of a few; for the force and activity which the first confers\r\nare irreconcilable with the guarantees of tranquillity which the second\r\nfurnishes.\r\n\r\nNotion Of Rights In The United States\r\n\r\nNo great people without a notion of rights\xe2\x80\x94How the notion of rights can\r\nbe given to people\xe2\x80\x94Respect of rights in the United States\xe2\x80\x94Whence it\r\narises.\r\n\r\nAfter the idea of virtue, I know no higher principle than that of\r\nright; or, to speak more accurately, these two ideas are commingled in\r\none. The idea of right is simply that of virtue introduced into the\r\npolitical world. It is the idea of right which enabled men to define\r\nanarchy and tyranny; and which taught them to remain independent\r\nwithout arrogance, as well as to obey without servility. The man who\r\nsubmits to violence is debased by his compliance; but when he obeys the\r\nmandate of one who possesses that right of authority which he\r\nacknowledges in a fellow-creature, he rises in some measure above the\r\nperson who delivers the command. There are no great men without virtue,\r\nand there are no great nations\xe2\x80\x94it may almost be added that there would\r\nbe no society\xe2\x80\x94without the notion of rights; for what is the condition\r\nof a mass of rational and intelligent beings who are only united\r\ntogether by the bond of force?\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the present time\r\nof inculcating the notion of rights, and of rendering it, as it were,\r\npalpable to the senses, is to invest all the members of the community\r\nwith the peaceful exercise of certain rights: this is very clearly seen\r\nin children, who are men without the strength and the experience of\r\nmanhood. When a child begins to move in the midst of the objects which\r\nsurround him, he is instinctively led to turn everything which he can\r\nlay his hands upon to his own purposes; he has no notion of the\r\nproperty of others; but as he gradually learns the value of things, and\r\nbegins to perceive that he may in his turn be deprived of his\r\npossessions, he becomes more circumspect, and he observes those rights\r\nin others which he wishes to have respected in himself. The principle\r\nwhich the child derives from the possession of his toys is taught to\r\nthe man by the objects which he may call his own. In America those\r\ncomplaints against property in general which are so frequent in Europe\r\nare never heard, because in America there are no paupers; and as\r\neveryone has property of his own to defend, everyone recognizes the\r\nprinciple upon which he holds it.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs in the political world. In America the lowest\r\nclasses have conceived a very high notion of political rights, because\r\nthey exercise those rights; and they refrain from attacking those of\r\nother people, in order to ensure their own from attack. Whilst in\r\nEurope the same classes sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme\r\npower, the American submits without a murmur to the authority of the\r\npettiest magistrate.\r\n\r\nThis truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of national\r\npeculiarities. In France very few pleasures are exclusively reserved\r\nfor the higher classes; the poor are admitted wherever the rich are\r\nreceived, and they consequently behave with propriety, and respect\r\nwhatever contributes to the enjoyments in which they themselves\r\nparticipate. In England, where wealth has a monopoly of amusement as\r\nwell as of power, complaints are made that whenever the poor happen to\r\nsteal into the enclosures which are reserved for the pleasures of the\r\nrich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can this be wondered at,\r\nsince care has been taken that they should have nothing to lose? *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ [This, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for the\r\namusements of the people in public parks, gardens, museums, etc.; and\r\nthe conduct of the people in these places of amusement has improved in\r\nthe same proportion.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government of democracy brings the notion of political rights to\r\nthe level of the humblest citizens, just as the dissemination of wealth\r\nbrings the notion of property within the reach of all the members of\r\nthe community; and I confess that, to my mind, this is one of its\r\ngreatest advantages. I do not assert that it is easy to teach men to\r\nexercise political rights; but I maintain that, when it is possible,\r\nthe effects which result from it are highly important; and I add that,\r\nif there ever was a time at which such an attempt ought to be made,\r\nthat time is our own. It is clear that the influence of religious\r\nbelief is shaken, and that the notion of divine rights is declining; it\r\nis evident that public morality is vitiated, and the notion of moral\r\nrights is also disappearing: these are general symptoms of the\r\nsubstitution of argument for faith, and of calculation for the impulses\r\nof sentiment. If, in the midst of this general disruption, you do not\r\nsucceed in connecting the notion of rights with that of personal\r\ninterest, which is the only immutable point in the human heart, what\r\nmeans will you have of governing the world except by fear? When I am\r\ntold that, since the laws are weak and the populace is wild, since\r\npassions are excited and the authority of virtue is paralyzed, no\r\nmeasures must be taken to increase the rights of the democracy, I\r\nreply, that it is for these very reasons that some measures of the kind\r\nmust be taken; and I am persuaded that governments are still more\r\ninterested in taking them than society at large, because governments\r\nare liable to be destroyed and society cannot perish.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the example which America\r\nfurnishes. In those States the people are invested with political\r\nrights at a time when they could scarcely be abused, for the citizens\r\nwere few in number and simple in their manners. As they have increased,\r\nthe Americans have not augmented the power of the democracy, but they\r\nhave, if I may use the expression, extended its dominions. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that the moment at which political rights are granted to a\r\npeople that had before been without them is a very critical, though it\r\nbe a necessary one. A child may kill before he is aware of the value of\r\nlife; and he may deprive another person of his property before he is\r\naware that his own may be taken away from him. The lower orders, when\r\nfirst they are invested with political rights, stand, in relation to\r\nthose rights, in the same position as the child does to the whole of\r\nnature, and the celebrated adage may then be applied to them, Homo puer\r\nrobustus. This truth may even be perceived in America. The States in\r\nwhich the citizens have enjoyed their rights longest are those in which\r\nthey make the best use of them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in\r\nprodigies than the art of being free; but there is nothing more arduous\r\nthan the apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not the case with despotic\r\ninstitutions: despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand\r\nprevious ills; it supports the right, it protects the oppressed, and it\r\nmaintains public order. The nation is lulled by the temporary\r\nprosperity which accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense of its\r\nown misery. Liberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the\r\nmidst of agitation, it is perfected by civil discord, and its benefits\r\ncannot be appreciated until it is already old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XIV: Advantages American Society Derive From Democracy\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\nRespect For The Law In The United States\r\n\r\nRespect of the Americans for the law\xe2\x80\x94Parental affection which they\r\nentertain for it\xe2\x80\x94Personal interest of everyone to increase the\r\nauthority of the law.\r\n\r\nIt is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either directly\r\nor indirectly, in the formation of the law; but it cannot be denied\r\nthat, when such a measure is possible the authority of the law is very\r\nmuch augmented. This popular origin, which impairs the excellence and\r\nthe wisdom of legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase its\r\npower. There is an amazing strength in the expression of the\r\ndetermination of a whole people, and when it declares itself the\r\nimagination of those who are most inclined to contest it is overawed by\r\nits authority. The truth of this fact is very well known by parties,\r\nand they consequently strive to make out a majority whenever they can.\r\nIf they have not the greater number of voters on their side, they\r\nassert that the true majority abstained from voting; and if they are\r\nfoiled even there, they have recourse to the body of those persons who\r\nhad no votes to give.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, except slaves, servants, and paupers in the\r\nreceipt of relief from the townships, there is no class of persons who\r\ndo not exercise the elective franchise, and who do not indirectly\r\ncontribute to make the laws. Those who design to attack the laws must\r\nconsequently either modify the opinion of the nation or trample upon\r\nits decision.\r\n\r\nA second reason, which is still more weighty, may be further adduced;\r\nin the United States everyone is personally interested in enforcing the\r\nobedience of the whole community to the law; for as the minority may\r\nshortly rally the majority to its principles, it is interested in\r\nprofessing that respect for the decrees of the legislator which it may\r\nsoon have occasion to claim for its own. However irksome an enactment\r\nmay be, the citizen of the United States complies with it, not only\r\nbecause it is the work of the majority, but because it originates in\r\nhis own authority, and he regards it as a contract to which he is\r\nhimself a party.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does\r\nnot exist which always looks upon the law as its natural enemy, and\r\naccordingly surveys it with fear and with fear and with distrust. It is\r\nimpossible, on the other hand, not to perceive that all classes display\r\nthe utmost reliance upon the legislation of their country, and that\r\nthey are attached to it by a kind of parental affection.\r\n\r\nI am wrong, however, in saying all classes; for as in America the\r\nEuropean scale of authority is inverted, the wealthy are there placed\r\nin a position analogous to that of the poor in the Old World, and it is\r\nthe opulent classes which frequently look upon the law with suspicion.\r\nI have already observed that the advantage of democracy is not, as has\r\nbeen sometimes asserted, that it protects the interests of the whole\r\ncommunity, but simply that it protects those of the majority. In the\r\nUnited States, where the poor rule, the rich have always some reason to\r\ndread the abuses of their power. This natural anxiety of the rich may\r\nproduce a sullen dissatisfaction, but society is not disturbed by it;\r\nfor the same reason which induces the rich to withhold their confidence\r\nin the legislative authority makes them obey its mandates; their\r\nwealth, which prevents them from making the law, prevents them from\r\nwithstanding it. Amongst civilized nations revolts are rarely excited,\r\nexcept by such persons as have nothing to lose by them; and if the laws\r\nof a democracy are not always worthy of respect, at least they always\r\nobtain it; for those who usually infringe the laws have no excuse for\r\nnot complying with the enactments they have themselves made, and by\r\nwhich they are themselves benefited, whilst the citizens whose\r\ninterests might be promoted by the infraction of them are induced, by\r\ntheir character and their stations, to submit to the decisions of the\r\nlegislature, whatever they may be. Besides which, the people in America\r\nobeys the law not only because it emanates from the popular authority,\r\nbut because that authority may modify it in any points which may prove\r\nvexatory; a law is observed because it is a self-imposed evil in the\r\nfirst place, and an evil of transient duration in the second.\r\n\r\nActivity Which Pervades All The Branches Of The Body Politic In The\r\nUnited States; Influence Which It Exercises Upon Society\r\n\r\nMore difficult to conceive the political activity which pervades the\r\nUnited States than the freedom and equality which reign there\xe2\x80\x94The great\r\nactivity which perpetually agitates the legislative bodies is only an\r\nepisode to the general activity\xe2\x80\x94Difficult for an American to confine\r\nhimself to his own business\xe2\x80\x94Political agitation extends to all social\r\nintercourse\xe2\x80\x94Commercial activity of the Americans partly attributable to\r\nthis cause\xe2\x80\x94Indirect advantages which society derives from a democratic\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOn passing from a country in which free institutions are established to\r\none where they do not exist, the traveller is struck by the change; in\r\nthe former all is bustle and activity, in the latter everything is calm\r\nand motionless. In the one, amelioration and progress are the general\r\ntopics of inquiry; in the other, it seems as if the community only\r\naspired to repose in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has\r\nacquired. Nevertheless, the country which exerts itself so strenuously\r\nto promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more prosperous\r\nthan that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we\r\ncompare them together, we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants\r\nare daily felt in the former, whilst so few seem to occur in the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIf this remark is applicable to those free countries in which\r\nmonarchical and aristocratic institutions subsist, it is still more\r\nstriking with regard to democratic republics. In these States it is not\r\nonly a portion of the people which is busied with the amelioration of\r\nits social condition, but the whole community is engaged in the task;\r\nand it is not the exigencies and the convenience of a single class for\r\nwhich a provision is to be made, but the exigencies and the convenience\r\nof all ranks of life.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to conceive the surpassing liberty which the\r\nAmericans enjoy; some idea may likewise be formed of the extreme\r\nequality which subsists amongst them, but the political activity which\r\npervades the United States must be seen in order to be understood. No\r\nsooner do you set foot upon the American soil than you are stunned by a\r\nkind of tumult; a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a\r\nthousand simultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfaction of their\r\nsocial wants. Everything is in motion around you; here, the people of\r\none quarter of a town are met to decide upon the building of a church;\r\nthere, the election of a representative is going on; a little further\r\nthe delegates of a district are posting to the town in order to consult\r\nupon some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of a\r\nvillage quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or\r\na public school. Meetings are called for the sole purpose of declaring\r\ntheir disapprobation of the line of conduct pursued by the Government;\r\nwhilst in other assemblies the citizens salute the authorities of the\r\nday as the fathers of their country. Societies are formed which regard\r\ndrunkenness as the principal cause of the evils under which the State\r\nlabors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a constant example\r\nof temperance. *c\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ At the time of my stay in the United States the temperance societies\r\nalready consisted of more than 270,000 members, and their effect had\r\nbeen to diminish the consumption of fermented liquors by 500,000\r\ngallons per annum in the State of Pennsylvania alone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great political agitation of the American legislative bodies, which\r\nis the only kind of excitement that attracts the attention of foreign\r\ncountries, is a mere episode or a sort of continuation of that\r\nuniversal movement which originates in the lowest classes of the people\r\nand extends successively to all the ranks of society. It is impossible\r\nto spend more efforts in the pursuit of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the\r\noccupation of a citizen in the United States, and almost the only\r\npleasure of which an American has any idea is to take a part in the\r\nGovernment, and to discuss the part he has taken. This feeling pervades\r\nthe most trifling habits of life; even the women frequently attend\r\npublic meetings and listen to political harangues as a recreation after\r\ntheir household labors. Debating clubs are to a certain extent a\r\nsubstitute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot converse,\r\nbut he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he falls into a\r\ndissertation. He speaks to you as if he was addressing a meeting; and\r\nif he should chance to warm in the course of the discussion, he will\r\ninfallibly say, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d to the person with whom he is conversing.\r\n\r\nIn some countries the inhabitants display a certain repugnance to avail\r\nthemselves of the political privileges with which the law invests them;\r\nit would seem that they set too high a value upon their time to spend\r\nit on the interests of the community; and they prefer to withdraw\r\nwithin the exact limits of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk\r\nfences and a quickset hedge. But if an American were condemned to\r\nconfine his activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half\r\nof his existence; he would feel an immense void in the life which he is\r\naccustomed to lead, and his wretchedness would be unbearable. *d I am\r\npersuaded that, if ever a despotic government is established in\r\nAmerica, it will find it more difficult to surmount the habits which\r\nfree institutions have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the\r\ncitizens to freedom.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars. Montesquieu\r\nsomewhere alludes to the excessive despondency of certain Roman\r\ncitizens who, after the excitement of political life, were all at once\r\nflung back into the stagnation of private life.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ceaseless agitation which democratic government has introduced\r\ninto the political world influences all social intercourse. I am not\r\nsure that upon the whole this is not the greatest advantage of\r\ndemocracy. And I am much less inclined to applaud it for what it does\r\nthan for what it causes to be done. It is incontestable that the people\r\nfrequently conducts public business very ill; but it is impossible that\r\nthe lower orders should take a part in public business without\r\nextending the circle of their ideas, and without quitting the ordinary\r\nroutine of their mental acquirements. The humblest individual who is\r\ncalled upon to co-operate in the government of society acquires a\r\ncertain degree of self-respect; and as he possesses authority, he can\r\ncommand the services of minds much more enlightened than his own. He is\r\ncanvassed by a multitude of applicants, who seek to deceive him in a\r\nthousand different ways, but who instruct him by their deceit. He takes\r\na part in political undertakings which did not originate in his own\r\nconception, but which give him a taste for undertakings of the kind.\r\nNew ameliorations are daily pointed out in the property which he holds\r\nin common with others, and this gives him the desire of improving that\r\nproperty which is more peculiarly his own. He is perhaps neither\r\nhappier nor better than those who came before him, but he is better\r\ninformed and more active. I have no doubt that the democratic\r\ninstitutions of the United States, joined to the physical constitution\r\nof the country, are the cause (not the direct, as is so often asserted,\r\nbut the indirect cause) of the prodigious commercial activity of the\r\ninhabitants. It is not engendered by the laws, but the people learns\r\nhow to promote it by the experience derived from legislation.\r\n\r\nWhen the opponents of democracy assert that a single individual\r\nperforms the duties which he undertakes much better than the government\r\nof the community, it appears to me that they are perfectly right. The\r\ngovernment of an individual, supposing an equality of instruction on\r\neither side, is more consistent, more persevering, and more accurate\r\nthan that of a multitude, and it is much better qualified judiciously\r\nto discriminate the characters of the men it employs. If any deny what\r\nI advance, they have certainly never seen a democratic government, or\r\nhave formed their opinion upon very partial evidence. It is true that\r\neven when local circumstances and the disposition of the people allow\r\ndemocratic institutions to subsist, they never display a regular and\r\nmethodical system of government. Democratic liberty is far from\r\naccomplishing all the projects it undertakes, with the skill of an\r\nadroit despotism. It frequently abandons them before they have borne\r\ntheir fruits, or risks them when the consequences may prove dangerous;\r\nbut in the end it produces more than any absolute government, and if it\r\ndo fewer things well, it does a greater number of things. Under its\r\nsway the transactions of the public administration are not nearly so\r\nimportant as what is done by private exertion. Democracy does not\r\nconfer the most skilful kind of government upon the people, but it\r\nproduces that which the most skilful governments are frequently unable\r\nto awaken, namely, an all-pervading and restless activity, a\r\nsuperabundant force, and an energy which is inseparable from it, and\r\nwhich may, under favorable circumstances, beget the most amazing\r\nbenefits. These are the true advantages of democracy.\r\n\r\nIn the present age, when the destinies of Christendom seem to be in\r\nsuspense, some hasten to assail democracy as its foe whilst it is yet\r\nin its early growth; and others are ready with their vows of adoration\r\nfor this new deity which is springing forth from chaos: but both\r\nparties are very imperfectly acquainted with the object of their hatred\r\nor of their desires; they strike in the dark, and distribute their\r\nblows by mere chance.\r\n\r\nWe must first understand what the purport of society and the aim of\r\ngovernment is held to be. If it be your intention to confer a certain\r\nelevation upon the human mind, and to teach it to regard the things of\r\nthis world with generous feelings, to inspire men with a scorn of mere\r\ntemporal advantage, to give birth to living convictions, and to keep\r\nalive the spirit of honorable devotedness; if you hold it to be a good\r\nthing to refine the habits, to embellish the manners, to cultivate the\r\narts of a nation, and to promote the love of poetry, of beauty, and of\r\nrenown; if you would constitute a people not unfitted to act with power\r\nupon all other nations, nor unprepared for those high enterprises\r\nwhich, whatever be the result of its efforts, will leave a name forever\r\nfamous in time\xe2\x80\x94if you believe such to be the principal object of\r\nsociety, you must avoid the government of democracy, which would be a\r\nvery uncertain guide to the end you have in view.\r\n\r\nBut if you hold it to be expedient to divert the moral and intellectual\r\nactivity of man to the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of\r\nthe necessaries of life; if a clear understanding be more profitable to\r\nman than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of\r\nheroism, but to create habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices\r\nthan crimes and are content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided\r\noffences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living in\r\nthe midst of a brilliant state of society, you are contented to have\r\nprosperity around you; if, in short, you are of opinion that the\r\nprincipal object of a Government is not to confer the greatest possible\r\nshare of power and of glory upon the body of the nation, but to ensure\r\nthe greatest degree of enjoyment and the least degree of misery to each\r\nof the individuals who compose it\xe2\x80\x94if such be your desires, you can have\r\nno surer means of satisfying them than by equalizing the conditions of\r\nmen, and establishing democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nBut if the time be passed at which such a choice was possible, and if\r\nsome superhuman power impel us towards one or the other of these two\r\ngovernments without consulting our wishes, let us at least endeavor to\r\nmake the best of that which is allotted to us; and let us so inquire\r\ninto its good and its evil propensities as to be able to foster the\r\nformer and repress the latter to the utmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And Its Consequences\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural strength of the majority in democracies\xe2\x80\x94Most of the American\r\nConstitutions have increased this strength by artificial means\xe2\x80\x94How this\r\nhas been done\xe2\x80\x94Pledged delegates\xe2\x80\x94Moral power of the majority\xe2\x80\x94Opinion as\r\nto its infallibility\xe2\x80\x94Respect for its rights, how augmented in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nUnlimited Power Of The Majority In The United States, And Its\r\nConsequences\r\n\r\nThe very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute\r\nsovereignty of the majority; for there is nothing in democratic States\r\nwhich is capable of resisting it. Most of the American Constitutions\r\nhave sought to increase this natural strength of the majority by\r\nartificial means. *a\r\n\r\na\r\n[ We observed, in examining the Federal Constitution, that the efforts\r\nof the legislators of the Union had been diametrically opposed to the\r\npresent tendency. The consequence has been that the Federal Government\r\nis more independent in its sphere than that of the States. But the\r\nFederal Government scarcely ever interferes in any but external\r\naffairs; and the governments of the State are in the governments of the\r\nStates are in reality the authorities which direct society in America.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legislature is, of all political institutions, the one which is\r\nmost easily swayed by the wishes of the majority. The Americans\r\ndetermined that the members of the legislature should be elected by the\r\npeople immediately, and for a very brief term, in order to subject\r\nthem, not only to the general convictions, but even to the daily\r\npassion, of their constituents. The members of both houses are taken\r\nfrom the same class in society, and are nominated in the same manner;\r\nso that the modifications of the legislative bodies are almost as rapid\r\nand quite as irresistible as those of a single assembly. It is to a\r\nlegislature thus constituted that almost all the authority of the\r\ngovernment has been entrusted.\r\n\r\nBut whilst the law increased the strength of those authorities which of\r\nthemselves were strong, it enfeebled more and more those which were\r\nnaturally weak. It deprived the representatives of the executive of all\r\nstability and independence, and by subjecting them completely to the\r\ncaprices of the legislature, it robbed them of the slender influence\r\nwhich the nature of a democratic government might have allowed them to\r\nretain. In several States the judicial power was also submitted to the\r\nelective discretion of the majority, and in all of them its existence\r\nwas made to depend on the pleasure of the legislative authority, since\r\nthe representatives were empowered annually to regulate the stipend of\r\nthe judges.\r\n\r\nCustom, however, has done even more than law. A proceeding which will\r\nin the end set all the guarantees of representative government at\r\nnaught is becoming more and more general in the United States; it\r\nfrequently happens that the electors, who choose a delegate, point out\r\na certain line of conduct to him, and impose upon him a certain number\r\nof positive obligations which he is pledged to fulfil. With the\r\nexception of the tumult, this comes to the same thing as if the\r\nmajority of the populace held its deliberations in the market-place.\r\n\r\nSeveral other circumstances concur in rendering the power of the\r\nmajority in America not only preponderant, but irresistible. The moral\r\nauthority of the majority is partly based upon the notion that there is\r\nmore intelligence and more wisdom in a great number of men collected\r\ntogether than in a single individual, and that the quantity of\r\nlegislators is more important than their quality. The theory of\r\nequality is in fact applied to the intellect of man: and human pride is\r\nthus assailed in its last retreat by a doctrine which the minority\r\nhesitate to admit, and in which they very slowly concur. Like all other\r\npowers, and perhaps more than all other powers, the authority of the\r\nmany requires the sanction of time; at first it enforces obedience by\r\nconstraint, but its laws are not respected until they have long been\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe right of governing society, which the majority supposes itself to\r\nderive from its superior intelligence, was introduced into the United\r\nStates by the first settlers, and this idea, which would be sufficient\r\nof itself to create a free nation, has now been amalgamated with the\r\nmanners of the people and the minor incidents of social intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim (which is still\r\na fundamental principle of the English Constitution) that the King\r\ncould do no wrong; and if he did do wrong, the blame was imputed to his\r\nadvisers. This notion was highly favorable to habits of obedience, and\r\nit enabled the subject to complain of the law without ceasing to love\r\nand honor the lawgiver. The Americans entertain the same opinion with\r\nrespect to the majority.\r\n\r\nThe moral power of the majority is founded upon yet another principle,\r\nwhich is, that the interests of the many are to be preferred to those\r\nof the few. It will readily be perceived that the respect here\r\nprofessed for the rights of the majority must naturally increase or\r\ndiminish according to the state of parties. When a nation is divided\r\ninto several irreconcilable factions, the privilege of the majority is\r\noften overlooked, because it is intolerable to comply with its demands.\r\n\r\nIf there existed in America a class of citizens whom the legislating\r\nmajority sought to deprive of exclusive privileges which they had\r\npossessed for ages, and to bring down from an elevated station to the\r\nlevel of the ranks of the multitude, it is probable that the minority\r\nwould be less ready to comply with its laws. But as the United States\r\nwere colonized by men holding equal rank amongst themselves, there is\r\nas yet no natural or permanent source of dissension between the\r\ninterests of its different inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere are certain communities in which the persons who constitute the\r\nminority can never hope to draw over the majority to their side,\r\nbecause they must then give up the very point which is at issue between\r\nthem. Thus, an aristocracy can never become a majority whilst it\r\nretains its exclusive privileges, and it cannot cede its privileges\r\nwithout ceasing to be an aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIn the United States political questions cannot be taken up in so\r\ngeneral and absolute a manner, and all parties are willing to recognize\r\nthe right of the majority, because they all hope to turn those rights\r\nto their own advantage at some future time. The majority therefore in\r\nthat country exercises a prodigious actual authority, and a moral\r\ninfluence which is scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles exist which\r\ncan impede or so much as retard its progress, or which can induce it to\r\nheed the complaints of those whom it crushes upon its path. This state\r\nof things is fatal in itself and dangerous for the future.\r\n\r\nHow The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Increases In America The\r\nInstability Of Legislation And Administration Inherent In Democracy The\r\nAmericans increase the mutability of the laws which is inherent in\r\ndemocracy by changing the legislature every year, and by investing it\r\nwith unbounded authority\xe2\x80\x94The same effect is produced upon the\r\nadministration\xe2\x80\x94In America social amelioration is conducted more\r\nenergetically but less perseveringly than in Europe.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the natural defects of democratic\r\ninstitutions, and they all of them increase at the exact ratio of the\r\npower of the majority. To begin with the most evident of them all; the\r\nmutability of the laws is an evil inherent in democratic government,\r\nbecause it is natural to democracies to raise men to power in very\r\nrapid succession. But this evil is more or less sensible in proportion\r\nto the authority and the means of action which the legislature\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nIn America the authority exercised by the legislative bodies is\r\nsupreme; nothing prevents them from accomplishing their wishes with\r\ncelerity, and with irresistible power, whilst they are supplied by new\r\nrepresentatives every year. That is to say, the circumstances which\r\ncontribute most powerfully to democratic instability, and which admit\r\nof the free application of caprice to every object in the State, are\r\nhere in full operation. In conformity with this principle, America is,\r\nat the present day, the country in the world where laws last the\r\nshortest time. Almost all the American constitutions have been amended\r\nwithin the course of thirty years: there is therefore not a single\r\nAmerican State which has not modified the principles of its legislation\r\nin that lapse of time. As for the laws themselves, a single glance upon\r\nthe archives of the different States of the Union suffices to convince\r\none that in America the activity of the legislator never slackens. Not\r\nthat the American democracy is naturally less stable than any other,\r\nbut that it is allowed to follow its capricious propensities in the\r\nformation of the laws. *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ The legislative acts promulgated by the State of Massachusetts alone,\r\nfrom the year 1780 to the present time, already fill three stout\r\nvolumes; and it must not be forgotten that the collection to which I\r\nallude was published in 1823, when many old laws which had fallen into\r\ndisuse were omitted. The State of Massachusetts, which is not more\r\npopulous than a department of France, may be considered as the most\r\nstable, the most consistent, and the most sagacious in its undertakings\r\nof the whole Union.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as absolute\r\nmanner in which its decisions are executed in the United States, has\r\nnot only the effect of rendering the law unstable, but it exercises the\r\nsame influence upon the execution of the law and the conduct of the\r\npublic administration. As the majority is the only power which it is\r\nimportant to court, all its projects are taken up with the greatest\r\nardor, but no sooner is its attention distracted than all this ardor\r\nceases; whilst in the free States of Europe the administration is at\r\nonce independent and secure, so that the projects of the legislature\r\nare put into execution, although its immediate attention may be\r\ndirected to other objects.\r\n\r\nIn America certain ameliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and\r\nactivity than elsewhere; in Europe the same ends are promoted by much\r\nless social effort, more continuously applied.\r\n\r\nSome years ago several pious individuals undertook to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of the prisons. The public was excited by the statements\r\nwhich they put forward, and the regeneration of criminals became a very\r\npopular undertaking. New prisons were built, and for the first time the\r\nidea of reforming as well as of punishing the delinquent formed a part\r\nof prison discipline. But this happy alteration, in which the public\r\nhad taken so hearty an interest, and which the exertions of the\r\ncitizens had irresistibly accelerated, could not be completed in a\r\nmoment. Whilst the new penitentiaries were being erected (and it was\r\nthe pleasure of the majority that they should be terminated with all\r\npossible celerity), the old prisons existed, which still contained a\r\ngreat number of offenders. These jails became more unwholesome and more\r\ncorrupt in proportion as the new establishments were beautified and\r\nimproved, forming a contrast which may readily be understood. The\r\nmajority was so eagerly employed in founding the new prisons that those\r\nwhich already existed were forgotten; and as the general attention was\r\ndiverted to a novel object, the care which had hitherto been bestowed\r\nupon the others ceased. The salutary regulations of discipline were\r\nfirst relaxed, and afterwards broken; so that in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of a prison which bore witness to the mild and enlightened\r\nspirit of our time, dungeons might be met with which reminded the\r\nvisitor of the barbarity of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And Its Consequences\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\nTyranny Of The Majority\r\n\r\nHow the principle of the sovereignty of the people is to be\r\nunderstood\xe2\x80\x94Impossibility of conceiving a mixed government\xe2\x80\x94The sovereign\r\npower must centre somewhere\xe2\x80\x94Precautions to be taken to control its\r\naction\xe2\x80\x94These precautions have not been taken in the United\r\nStates\xe2\x80\x94Consequences.\r\n\r\nI hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that, politically\r\nspeaking, a people has a right to do whatsoever it pleases, and yet I\r\nhave asserted that all authority originates in the will of the\r\nmajority. Am I then, in contradiction with myself?\r\n\r\nA general law\xe2\x80\x94which bears the name of Justice\xe2\x80\x94has been made and\r\nsanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that people, but by a\r\nmajority of mankind. The rights of every people are consequently\r\nconfined within the limits of what is just. A nation may be considered\r\nin the light of a jury which is empowered to represent society at\r\nlarge, and to apply the great and general law of justice. Ought such a\r\njury, which represents society, to have more power than the society in\r\nwhich the laws it applies originate?\r\n\r\nWhen I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which\r\nthe majority has of commanding, but I simply appeal from the\r\nsovereignty of the people to the sovereignty of mankind. It has been\r\nasserted that a people can never entirely outstep the boundaries of\r\njustice and of reason in those affairs which are more peculiarly its\r\nown, and that consequently, full power may fearlessly be given to the\r\nmajority by which it is represented. But this language is that of a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nA majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose\r\nopinions, and most frequently whose interests, are opposed to those of\r\nanother being, which is styled a minority. If it be admitted that a\r\nman, possessing absolute power, may misuse that power by wronging his\r\nadversaries, why should a majority not be liable to the same reproach?\r\nMen are not apt to change their characters by agglomeration; nor does\r\ntheir patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the\r\nconsciousness of their strength. *c And for these reasons I can never\r\nwillingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures with that unlimited\r\nauthority which I should refuse to any one of them.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong another\r\npeople; but parties may be looked upon as lesser nations within a\r\ngreater one, and they are aliens to each other: if, therefore, it be\r\nadmitted that a nation can act tyrannically towards another nation, it\r\ncannot be denied that a party may do the same towards another party.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think that it is possible to combine several principles in the\r\nsame government, so as at the same time to maintain freedom, and really\r\nto oppose them to one another. The form of government which is usually\r\ntermed mixed has always appeared to me to be a mere chimera. Accurately\r\nspeaking there is no such thing as a mixed government (with the meaning\r\nusually given to that word), because in all communities some one\r\nprinciple of action may be discovered which preponderates over the\r\nothers. England in the last century, which has been more especially\r\ncited as an example of this form of Government, was in point of fact an\r\nessentially aristocratic State, although it comprised very powerful\r\nelements of democracy; for the laws and customs of the country were\r\nsuch that the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end, and\r\nsubject the direction of public affairs to its own will. The error\r\narose from too much attention being paid to the actual struggle which\r\nwas going on between the nobles and the people, without considering the\r\nprobable issue of the contest, which was in reality the important\r\npoint. When a community really has a mixed government, that is to say,\r\nwhen it is equally divided between two adverse principles, it must\r\neither pass through a revolution or fall into complete dissolution.\r\n\r\nI am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be\r\nmade to predominate over the others; but I think that liberty is\r\nendangered when this power is checked by no obstacles which may retard\r\nits course, and force it to moderate its own vehemence.\r\n\r\nUnlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing; human beings\r\nare not competent to exercise it with discretion, and God alone can be\r\nomnipotent, because His wisdom and His justice are always equal to His\r\npower. But no power upon earth is so worthy of honor for itself, or of\r\nreverential obedience to the rights which it represents, that I would\r\nconsent to admit its uncontrolled and all-predominant authority. When I\r\nsee that the right and the means of absolute command are conferred on a\r\npeople or upon a king, upon an aristocracy or a democracy, a monarchy\r\nor a republic, I recognize the germ of tyranny, and I journey onward to\r\na land of more hopeful institutions.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the main evil of the present democratic institutions of\r\nthe United States does not arise, as is often asserted in Europe, from\r\ntheir weakness, but from their overpowering strength; and I am not so\r\nmuch alarmed at the excessive liberty which reigns in that country as\r\nat the very inadequate securities which exist against tyranny.\r\n\r\nWhen an individual or a party is wronged in the United States, to whom\r\ncan he apply for redress? If to public opinion, public opinion\r\nconstitutes the majority; if to the legislature, it represents the\r\nmajority, and implicitly obeys its injunctions; if to the executive\r\npower, it is appointed by the majority, and remains a passive tool in\r\nits hands; the public troops consist of the majority under arms; the\r\njury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases;\r\nand in certain States even the judges are elected by the majority.\r\nHowever iniquitous or absurd the evil of which you complain may be, you\r\nmust submit to it as well as you can. *d\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ A striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned by the\r\ndespotism of the majority occurred at Baltimore in the year 1812. At\r\nthat time the war was very popular in Baltimore. A journal which had\r\ntaken the other side of the question excited the indignation of the\r\ninhabitants by its opposition. The populace assembled, broke the\r\nprinting-presses, and attacked the houses of the newspaper editors. The\r\nmilitia was called out, but no one obeyed the call; and the only means\r\nof saving the poor wretches who were threatened by the frenzy of the\r\nmob was to throw them into prison as common malefactors. But even this\r\nprecaution was ineffectual; the mob collected again during the night,\r\nthe magistrates again made a vain attempt to call out the militia, the\r\nprison was forced, one of the newspaper editors was killed upon the\r\nspot, and the others were left for dead; the guilty parties were\r\nacquitted by the jury when they were brought to trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nI said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, \xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to\r\nexplain to me how it happens that in a State founded by Quakers, and\r\ncelebrated for its toleration, freed blacks are not allowed to exercise\r\ncivil rights. They pay the taxes; is it not fair that they should have\r\na vote?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou insult us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my informant, \xe2\x80\x9cif you imagine that our\r\nlegislators could have committed so gross an act of injustice and\r\nintolerance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! then the blacks possess the right of voting in this county?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout the smallest doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it, then, that at the polling-booth this morning I did not\r\nperceive a single negro in the whole meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the fault of the law: the negroes have an undisputed right\r\nof voting, but they voluntarily abstain from making their appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very pretty piece of modesty on their parts!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the truth is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but they are\r\nafraid of being maltreated; in this country the law is sometimes unable\r\nto maintain its authority without the support of the majority. But in\r\nthis case the majority entertains very strong prejudices against the\r\nblacks, and the magistrates are unable to protect them in the exercise\r\nof their legal privileges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! then the majority claims the right not only of making the laws,\r\nbut of breaking the laws it has made?\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, a legislative power could be so constituted as\r\nto represent the majority without necessarily being the slave of its\r\npassions; an executive, so as to retain a certain degree of\r\nuncontrolled authority; and a judiciary, so as to remain independent of\r\nthe two other powers; a government would be formed which would still be\r\ndemocratic without incurring any risk of tyrannical abuse.\r\n\r\nI do not say that tyrannical abuses frequently occur in America at the\r\npresent day, but I maintain that no sure barrier is established against\r\nthem, and that the causes which mitigate the government are to be found\r\nin the circumstances and the manners of the country more than in its\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nEffects Of The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Upon The Arbitrary\r\nAuthority Of The American Public Officers\r\n\r\nLiberty left by the American laws to public officers within a certain\r\nsphere\xe2\x80\x94Their power.\r\n\r\nA distinction must be drawn between tyranny and arbitrary power.\r\nTyranny may be exercised by means of the law, and in that case it is\r\nnot arbitrary; arbitrary power may be exercised for the good of the\r\ncommunity at large, in which case it is not tyrannical. Tyranny usually\r\nemploys arbitrary means, but, if necessary, it can rule without them.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the unbounded power of the majority, which is\r\nfavorable to the legal despotism of the legislature, is likewise\r\nfavorable to the arbitrary authority of the magistrate. The majority\r\nhas an entire control over the law when it is made and when it is\r\nexecuted; and as it possesses an equal authority over those who are in\r\npower and the community at large, it considers public officers as its\r\npassive agents, and readily confides the task of serving its designs to\r\ntheir vigilance. The details of their office and the privileges which\r\nthey are to enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority\r\ntreats them as a master does his servants when they are always at work\r\nin his sight, and he has the power of directing or reprimanding them at\r\nevery instant.\r\n\r\nIn general the American functionaries are far more independent than the\r\nFrench civil officers within the sphere which is prescribed to them.\r\nSometimes, even, they are allowed by the popular authority to exceed\r\nthose bounds; and as they are protected by the opinion, and backed by\r\nthe co-operation, of the majority, they venture upon such\r\nmanifestations of their power as astonish a European. By this means\r\nhabits are formed in the heart of a free country which may some day\r\nprove fatal to its liberties.\r\n\r\nPower Exercised By The Majority In America Upon Opinion\r\n\r\nIn America, when the majority has once irrevocably decided a question,\r\nall discussion ceases\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94Moral power exercised by the\r\nmajority upon opinion\xe2\x80\x94Democratic republics have deprived despotism of\r\nits physical instruments\xe2\x80\x94Their despotism sways the minds of men.\r\n\r\nIt is in the examination of the display of public opinion in the United\r\nStates that we clearly perceive how far the power of the majority\r\nsurpasses all the powers with which we are acquainted in Europe.\r\nIntellectual principles exercise an influence which is so invisible,\r\nand often so inappreciable, that they baffle the toils of oppression.\r\nAt the present time the most absolute monarchs in Europe are unable to\r\nprevent certain notions, which are opposed to their authority, from\r\ncirculating in secret throughout their dominions, and even in their\r\ncourts. Such is not the case in America; as long as the majority is\r\nstill undecided, discussion is carried on; but as soon as its decision\r\nis irrevocably pronounced, a submissive silence is observed, and the\r\nfriends, as well as the opponents, of the measure unite in assenting to\r\nits propriety. The reason of this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so\r\nabsolute as to combine all the powers of society in his own hands, and\r\nto conquer all opposition with the energy of a majority which is\r\ninvested with the right of making and of executing the laws.\r\n\r\nThe authority of a king is purely physical, and it controls the actions\r\nof the subject without subduing his private will; but the majority\r\npossesses a power which is physical and moral at the same time; it acts\r\nupon the will as well as upon the actions of men, and it represses not\r\nonly all contest, but all controversy. I know no country in which there\r\nis so little true independence of mind and freedom of discussion as in\r\nAmerica. In any constitutional state in Europe every sort of religious\r\nand political theory may be advocated and propagated abroad; for there\r\nis no country in Europe so subdued by any single authority as not to\r\ncontain citizens who are ready to protect the man who raises his voice\r\nin the cause of truth from the consequences of his hardihood. If he is\r\nunfortunate enough to live under an absolute government, the people is\r\nupon his side; if he inhabits a free country, he may find a shelter\r\nbehind the authority of the throne, if he require one. The aristocratic\r\npart of society supports him in some countries, and the democracy in\r\nothers. But in a nation where democratic institutions exist, organized\r\nlike those of the United States, there is but one sole authority, one\r\nsingle element of strength and of success, with nothing beyond it.\r\n\r\nIn America the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty\r\nof opinion: within these barriers an author may write whatever he\r\npleases, but he will repent it if he ever step beyond them. Not that he\r\nis exposed to the terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by the\r\nslights and persecutions of daily obloquy. His political career is\r\nclosed forever, since he has offended the only authority which is able\r\nto promote his success. Every sort of compensation, even that of\r\ncelebrity, is refused to him. Before he published his opinions he\r\nimagined that he held them in common with many others; but no sooner\r\nhas he declared them openly than he is loudly censured by his\r\noverbearing opponents, whilst those who think without having the\r\ncourage to speak, like him, abandon him in silence. He yields at\r\nlength, oppressed by the daily efforts he has been making, and he\r\nsubsides into silence, as if he was tormented by remorse for having\r\nspoken the truth.\r\n\r\nFetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which tyranny formerly\r\nemployed; but the civilization of our age has refined the arts of\r\ndespotism which seemed, however, to have been sufficiently perfected\r\nbefore. The excesses of monarchical power had devised a variety of\r\nphysical means of oppression: the democratic republics of the present\r\nday have rendered it as entirely an affair of the mind as that will\r\nwhich it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of an\r\nindividual despot the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul,\r\nand the soul escaped the blows which were directed against it and rose\r\nsuperior to the attempt; but such is not the course adopted by tyranny\r\nin democratic republics; there the body is left free, and the soul is\r\nenslaved. The sovereign can no longer say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall think as I do on\r\npain of death;\xe2\x80\x9d but he says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are free to think differently from\r\nme, and to retain your life, your property, and all that you possess;\r\nbut if such be your determination, you are henceforth an alien among\r\nyour people. You may retain your civil rights, but they will be useless\r\nto you, for you will never be chosen by your fellow-citizens if you\r\nsolicit their suffrages, and they will affect to scorn you if you\r\nsolicit their esteem. You will remain among men, but you will be\r\ndeprived of the rights of mankind. Your fellow-creatures will shun you\r\nlike an impure being, and those who are most persuaded of your\r\ninnocence will abandon you too, lest they should be shunned in their\r\nturn. Go in peace! I have given you your life, but it is an existence\r\nin comparably worse than death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMonarchical institutions have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us\r\nbeware lest democratic republics should restore oppression, and should\r\nrender it less odious and less degrading in the eyes of the many, by\r\nmaking it still more onerous to the few.\r\n\r\nWorks have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World\r\nexpressly intended to censure the vices and deride the follies of the\r\ntimes; Labruyere inhabited the palace of Louis XIV when he composed his\r\nchapter upon the Great, and Moliere criticised the courtiers in the\r\nvery pieces which were acted before the Court. But the ruling power in\r\nthe United States is not to be made game of; the smallest reproach\r\nirritates its sensibility, and the slightest joke which has any\r\nfoundation in truth renders it indignant; from the style of its\r\nlanguage to the more solid virtues of its character, everything must be\r\nmade the subject of encomium. No writer, whatever be his eminence, can\r\nescape from this tribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens. The\r\nmajority lives in the perpetual practice of self-applause, and there\r\nare certain truths which the Americans can only learn from strangers or\r\nfrom experience.\r\n\r\nIf great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason is\r\nvery simply given in these facts; there can be no literary genius\r\nwithout freedom of opinion, and freedom of opinion does not exist in\r\nAmerica. The Inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number\r\nof anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the\r\nmajority succeeds much better in the United States, since it actually\r\nremoves the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are to be met with in\r\nAmerica, but, to say the truth, there is no public organ of infidelity.\r\nAttempts have been made by some governments to protect the morality of\r\nnations by prohibiting licentious books. In the United States no one is\r\npunished for this sort of works, but no one is induced to write them;\r\nnot because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but\r\nbecause the majority of the community is decent and orderly.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power\r\nare unquestionable, and I am simply discussing the nature of the power\r\nitself. This irresistible authority is a constant fact, and its\r\njudicious exercise is an accidental occurrence.\r\n\r\nEffects Of The Tyranny Of The Majority Upon The National Character Of\r\nThe Americans\r\n\r\nEffects of the tyranny of the majority more sensibly felt hitherto in\r\nthe manners than in the conduct of society\xe2\x80\x94They check the development\r\nof leading characters\xe2\x80\x94Democratic republics organized like the United\r\nStates bring the practice of courting favor within the reach of the\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x94Proofs of this spirit in the United States\xe2\x80\x94Why there is more\r\npatriotism in the people than in those who govern in its name.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very slightly\r\nperceptible in political society, but they already begin to exercise an\r\nunfavorable influence upon the national character of the Americans. I\r\nam inclined to attribute the singular paucity of distinguished\r\npolitical characters to the ever-increasing activity of the despotism\r\nof the majority in the United States. When the American Revolution\r\nbroke out they arose in great numbers, for public opinion then served,\r\nnot to tyrannize over, but to direct the exertions of individuals.\r\nThose celebrated men took a full part in the general agitation of mind\r\ncommon at that period, and they attained a high degree of personal\r\nfame, which was reflected back upon the nation, but which was by no\r\nmeans borrowed from it.\r\n\r\nIn absolute governments the great nobles who are nearest to the throne\r\nflatter the passions of the sovereign, and voluntarily truckle to his\r\ncaprices. But the mass of the nation does not degrade itself by\r\nservitude: it often submits from weakness, from habit, or from\r\nignorance, and sometimes from loyalty. Some nations have been known to\r\nsacrifice their own desires to those of the sovereign with pleasure and\r\nwith pride, thus exhibiting a sort of independence in the very act of\r\nsubmission. These peoples are miserable, but they are not degraded.\r\nThere is a great difference between doing what one does not approve and\r\nfeigning to approve what one does; the one is the necessary case of a\r\nweak person, the other befits the temper of a lackey.\r\n\r\nIn free countries, where everyone is more or less called upon to give\r\nhis opinion in the affairs of state; in democratic republics, where\r\npublic life is incessantly commingled with domestic affairs, where the\r\nsovereign authority is accessible on every side, and where its\r\nattention can almost always be attracted by vociferation, more persons\r\nare to be met with who speculate upon its foibles and live at the cost\r\nof its passions than in absolute monarchies. Not because men are\r\nnaturally worse in these States than elsewhere, but the temptation is\r\nstronger, and of easier access at the same time. The result is a far\r\nmore extensive debasement of the characters of citizens.\r\n\r\nDemocratic republics extend the practice of currying favor with the\r\nmany, and they introduce it into a greater number of classes at once:\r\nthis is one of the most serious reproaches that can be addressed to\r\nthem. In democratic States organized on the principles of the American\r\nrepublics, this is more especially the case, where the authority of the\r\nmajority is so absolute and so irresistible that a man must give up his\r\nrights as a citizen, and almost abjure his quality as a human being, if\r\nte intends to stray from the track which it lays down.\r\n\r\nIn that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to power in the United\r\nStates I found very few men who displayed any of that manly candor and\r\nthat masculine independence of opinion which frequently distinguished\r\nthe Americans in former times, and which constitutes the leading\r\nfeature in distinguished characters, wheresoever they may be found. It\r\nseems, at first sight, as if all the minds of the Americans were formed\r\nupon one model, so accurately do they correspond in their manner of\r\njudging. A stranger does, indeed, sometimes meet with Americans who\r\ndissent from these rigorous formularies; with men who deplore the\r\ndefects of the laws, the mutability and the ignorance of democracy; who\r\neven go so far as to observe the evil tendencies which impair the\r\nnational character, and to point out such remedies as it might be\r\npossible to apply; but no one is there to hear these things besides\r\nyourself, and you, to whom these secret reflections are confided, are a\r\nstranger and a bird of passage. They are very ready to communicate\r\ntruths which are useless to you, but they continue to hold a different\r\nlanguage in public.\r\n\r\nIf ever these lines are read in America, I am well assured of two\r\nthings: in the first place, that all who peruse them will raise their\r\nvoices to condemn me; and in the second place, that very many of them\r\nwill acquit me at the bottom of their conscience.\r\n\r\nI have heard of patriotism in the United States, and it is a virtue\r\nwhich may be found among the people, but never among the leaders of the\r\npeople. This may be explained by analogy; despotism debases the\r\noppressed much more than the oppressor: in absolute monarchies the king\r\nhas often great virtues, but the courtiers are invariably servile. It\r\nis true that the American courtiers do not say \xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a distinction without a difference. They are forever talking\r\nof the natural intelligence of the populace they serve; they do not\r\ndebate the question as to which of the virtues of their master is\r\npre-eminently worthy of admiration, for they assure him that he\r\npossesses all the virtues under heaven without having acquired them, or\r\nwithout caring to acquire them; they do not give him their daughters\r\nand their wives to be raised at his pleasure to the rank of his\r\nconcubines, but, by sacrificing their opinions, they prostitute\r\nthemselves. Moralists and philosophers in America are not obliged to\r\nconceal their opinions under the veil of allegory; but, before they\r\nventure upon a harsh truth, they say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are aware that the people\r\nwhich we are addressing is too superior to all the weaknesses of human\r\nnature to lose the command of its temper for an instant; and we should\r\nnot hold this language if we were not speaking to men whom their\r\nvirtues and their intelligence render more worthy of freedom than all\r\nthe rest of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d It would have been impossible for the\r\nsycophants of Louis XIV to flatter more dexterously. For my part, I am\r\npersuaded that in all governments, whatever their nature may be,\r\nservility will cower to force, and adulation will cling to power. The\r\nonly means of preventing men from degrading themselves is to invest no\r\none with that unlimited authority which is the surest method of\r\ndebasing them.\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Dangers Of The American Republics Proceed From The\r\nUnlimited Power Of The Majority\r\n\r\nDemocratic republics liable to perish from a misuse of their power, and\r\nnot by impotence\xe2\x80\x94The Governments of the American republics are more\r\ncentralized and more energetic than those of the monarchies of\r\nEurope\xe2\x80\x94Dangers resulting from this\xe2\x80\x94Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson\r\nupon this point.\r\n\r\nGovernments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyranny. In the\r\nformer case their power escapes from them; it is wrested from their\r\ngrasp in the latter. Many observers, who have witnessed the anarchy of\r\ndemocratic States, have imagined that the government of those States\r\nwas naturally weak and impotent. The truth is, that when once\r\nhostilities are begun between parties, the government loses its control\r\nover society. But I do not think that a democratic power is naturally\r\nwithout force or without resources: say, rather, that it is almost\r\nalways by the abuse of its force and the misemployment of its resources\r\nthat a democratic government fails. Anarchy is almost always produced\r\nby its tyranny or its mistakes, but not by its want of strength.\r\n\r\nIt is important not to confound stability with force, or the greatness\r\nof a thing with its duration. In democratic republics, the power which\r\ndirects *e society is not stable; for it often changes hands and\r\nassumes a new direction. But whichever way it turns, its force is\r\nalmost irresistible. The Governments of the American republics appear\r\nto me to be as much centralized as those of the absolute monarchies of\r\nEurope, and more energetic than they are. I do not, therefore, imagine\r\nthat they will perish from weakness. *f\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ This power may be centred in an assembly, in which case it will be\r\nstrong without being stable; or it may be centred in an individual, in\r\nwhich case it will be less strong, but more stable.]\r\n\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ I presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader here, as\r\nwell as throughout the remainder of this chapter, that I am speaking,\r\nnot of the Federal Government, but of the several governments of each\r\nState, which the majority controls at its pleasure.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf ever the free institutions of America are destroyed, that event may\r\nbe attributed to the unlimited authority of the majority, which may at\r\nsome future time urge the minorities to desperation, and oblige them to\r\nhave recourse to physical force. Anarchy will then be the result, but\r\nit will have been brought about by despotism.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the \xe2\x80\x9cFederalist,\xe2\x80\x9d No. 51.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society\r\nagainst the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the\r\nsociety against the injustice of the other part. Justice is the end of\r\ngovernment. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever\r\nwill be, pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the\r\npursuit. In a society, under the forms of which the stronger faction\r\ncan readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said\r\nto reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not\r\nsecured against the violence of the stronger: and as in the latter\r\nstate even the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of\r\ntheir condition to submit to a government which may protect the weak as\r\nwell as themselves, so in the former state will the more powerful\r\nfactions be gradually induced by a like motive to wish for a government\r\nwhich will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more\r\npowerful. It can be little doubted that, if the State of Rhode Island\r\nwas separated from the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity\r\nof right under the popular form of government within such narrow limits\r\nwould be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of the factious\r\nmajorities, that some power altogether independent of the people would\r\nsoon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had\r\nproved the necessity of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJefferson has also thus expressed himself in a letter to Madison: *g\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe executive power in our Government is not the only, perhaps not\r\neven the principal, object of my solicitude. The tyranny of the\r\nLegislature is really the danger most to be feared, and will continue\r\nto be so for many years to come. The tyranny of the executive power\r\nwill come in its turn, but at a more distant period.\xe2\x80\x9d I am glad to cite\r\nthe opinion of Jefferson upon this subject rather than that of another,\r\nbecause I consider him to be the most powerful advocate democracy has\r\never sent forth.\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ March 15, 1789.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVI: Causes Mitigating Tyranny In The United States\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national majority does not pretend to conduct all business\xe2\x80\x94Is\r\nobliged to employ the town and county magistrates to execute its\r\nsupreme decisions.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between\r\na centralized government and a centralized administration.

If the\r\ndirecting power of the American communities had both these instruments\r\nof government at its disposal, and united the habit of executing its\r\nown commands to the right of commanding; if, after having established\r\nthe general principles of government, it descended to the details of\r\npublic business; and if, having regulated the great interests of the\r\ncountry, it could penetrate into the privacy of individual interests,\r\nfreedom would soon be banished from the New World.\r\n\r\nBut in the United States the majority, which so frequently displays the\r\ntastes and the propensities of a despot, is still destitute of the more\r\nperfect instruments of tyranny. In the American republics the activity\r\nof the central Government has never as yet been extended beyond a\r\nlimited number of objects sufficiently prominent to call forth its\r\nattention. The secondary affairs of society have never been regulated\r\nby its authority, and nothing has hitherto betrayed its desire of\r\ninterfering in them. The majority is become more and more absolute, but\r\nit has not increased the prerogatives of the central government; those\r\ngreat prerogatives have been confined to a certain sphere; and although\r\nthe despotism of the majority may be galling upon one point, it cannot\r\nbe said to extend to all. However the predominant party in the nation\r\nmay be carried away by its passions, however ardent it may be in the\r\npursuit of its projects, it cannot oblige all the citizens to comply\r\nwith its desires in the same manner and at the same time throughout the\r\ncountry. When the central Government which represents that majority has\r\nissued a decree, it must entrust the execution of its will to agents,\r\nover whom it frequently has no control, and whom it cannot perpetually\r\ndirect. The townships, municipal bodies, and counties may therefore be\r\nlooked upon as concealed break-waters, which check or part the tide of\r\npopular excitement. If an oppressive law were passed, the liberties of\r\nthe people would still be protected by the means by which that law\r\nwould be put in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details\r\nand (as I will venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative\r\ntyranny. Nor does the people entertain that full consciousness of its\r\nauthority which would prompt it to interfere in these matters; it knows\r\nthe extent of its natural powers, but it is unacquainted with the\r\nincreased resources which the art of government might furnish.\r\n\r\nThis point deserves attention, for if a democratic republic similar to\r\nthat of the United States were ever founded in a country where the\r\npower of a single individual had previously subsisted, and the effects\r\nof a centralized administration had sunk deep into the habits and the\r\nlaws of the people, I do not hesitate to assert, that in that country a\r\nmore insufferable despotism would prevail than any which now exists in\r\nthe monarchical States of Europe, or indeed than any which could be\r\nfound on this side of the confines of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Profession Of The Law In The United States Serves To Counterpoise\r\nThe Democracy\r\n\r\nUtility of discriminating the natural propensities of the members of\r\nthe legal profession\xe2\x80\x94These men called upon to act a prominent part in\r\nfuture society\xe2\x80\x94In what manner the peculiar pursuits of lawyers give an\r\naristocratic turn to their ideas\xe2\x80\x94Accidental causes which may check this\r\ntendency\xe2\x80\x94Ease with which the aristocracy coalesces with legal men\xe2\x80\x94Use\r\nof lawyers to a despot\xe2\x80\x94The profession of the law constitutes the only\r\naristocratic element with which the natural elements of democracy will\r\ncombine\xe2\x80\x94Peculiar causes which tend to give an aristocratic turn of mind\r\nto the English and American lawyers\xe2\x80\x94The aristocracy of America is on\r\nthe bench and at the bar\xe2\x80\x94Influence of lawyers upon American\r\nsociety\xe2\x80\x94Their peculiar magisterial habits affect the legislature, the\r\nadministration, and even the people.\r\n\r\nIn visiting the Americans and in studying their laws we perceive that\r\nthe authority they have entrusted to members of the legal profession,\r\nand the influence which these individuals exercise in the Government,\r\nis the most powerful existing security against the excesses of\r\ndemocracy. This effect seems to me to result from a general cause which\r\nit is useful to investigate, since it may produce analogous\r\nconsequences elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all\r\nthe vicissitudes of political society in Europe during the last five\r\nhundred years. At one time they have been the instruments of those who\r\nwere invested with political authority, and at another they have\r\nsucceeded in converting political authorities into their instrument. In\r\nthe Middle Ages they afforded a powerful support to the Crown, and\r\nsince that period they have exerted themselves to the utmost to limit\r\nthe royal prerogative. In England they have contracted a close alliance\r\nwith the aristocracy; in France they have proved to be the most\r\ndangerous enemies of that class. It is my object to inquire whether,\r\nunder all these circumstances, the members of the legal profession have\r\nbeen swayed by sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been\r\nimpelled by principles which are inherent in their pursuits, and which\r\nwill always recur in history. I am incited to this investigation by\r\nreflecting that this particular class of men will most likely play a\r\nprominent part in that order of things to which the events of our time\r\nare giving birth.\r\n\r\nMen who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits\r\nderive from those occupations certain habits of order, a taste for\r\nformalities, and a kind of instinctive regard for the regular\r\nconnection of ideas, which naturally render them very hostile to the\r\nrevolutionary spirit and the unreflecting passions of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe special information which lawyers derive from their studies ensures\r\nthem a separate station in society, and they constitute a sort of\r\nprivileged body in the scale of intelligence. This notion of their\r\nsuperiority perpetually recurs to them in the practice of their\r\nprofession: they are the masters of a science which is necessary, but\r\nwhich is not very generally known; they serve as arbiters between the\r\ncitizens; and the habit of directing the blind passions of parties in\r\nlitigation to their purpose inspires them with a certain contempt for\r\nthe judgment of the multitude. To this it may be added that they\r\nnaturally constitute a body, not by any previous understanding, or by\r\nan agreement which directs them to a common end; but the analogy of\r\ntheir studies and the uniformity of their proceedings connect their\r\nminds together, as much as a common interest could combine their\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\nA portion of the tastes and of the habits of the aristocracy may\r\nconsequently be discovered in the characters of men in the profession\r\nof the law. They participate in the same instinctive love of order and\r\nof formalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions\r\nof the multitude, and the same secret contempt of the government of the\r\npeople. I do not mean to say that the natural propensities of lawyers\r\nare sufficiently strong to sway them irresistibly; for they, like most\r\nother men, are governed by their private interests and the advantages\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\nIn a state of society in which the members of the legal profession are\r\nprevented from holding that rank in the political world which they\r\nenjoy in private life, we may rest assured that they will be the\r\nforemost agents of revolution. But it must then be inquired whether the\r\ncause which induces them to innovate and to destroy is accidental, or\r\nwhether it belongs to some lasting purpose which they entertain. It is\r\ntrue that lawyers mainly contributed to the overthrow of the French\r\nmonarchy in 1789; but it remains to be seen whether they acted thus\r\nbecause they had studied the laws, or because they were prohibited from\r\nco-operating in the work of legislation.\r\n\r\nFive hundred years ago the English nobles headed the people, and spoke\r\nin its name; at the present time the aristocracy supports the throne,\r\nand defends the royal prerogative. But aristocracy has, notwithstanding\r\nthis, its peculiar instincts and propensities. We must be careful not\r\nto confound isolated members of a body with the body itself. In all\r\nfree governments, of whatsoever form they may be, members of the legal\r\nprofession will be found at the head of all parties. The same remark is\r\nalso applicable to the aristocracy; for almost all the democratic\r\nconvulsions which have agitated the world have been directed by nobles.\r\n\r\nA privileged body can never satisfy the ambition of all its members; it\r\nhas always more talents and more passions to content and to employ than\r\nit can find places; so that a considerable number of individuals are\r\nusually to be met with who are inclined to attack those very privileges\r\nwhich they find it impossible to turn to their own account.\r\n\r\nI do not, then, assert that all the members of the legal profession are\r\nat all times the friends of order and the opponents of innovation, but\r\nmerely that most of them usually are so. In a community in which\r\nlawyers are allowed to occupy, without opposition, that high station\r\nwhich naturally belongs to them, their general spirit will be eminently\r\nconservative and anti-democratic. When an aristocracy excludes the\r\nleaders of that profession from its ranks, it excites enemies which are\r\nthe more formidable to its security as they are independent of the\r\nnobility by their industrious pursuits; and they feel themselves to be\r\nits equal in point of intelligence, although they enjoy less opulence\r\nand less power. But whenever an aristocracy consents to impart some of\r\nits privileges to these same individuals, the two classes coalesce very\r\nreadily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a single order of\r\nfamily interests.\r\n\r\nI am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch will always be\r\nable to convert legal practitioners into the most serviceable\r\ninstruments of his authority. There is a far greater affinity between\r\nthis class of individuals and the executive power than there is between\r\nthem and the people; just as there is a greater natural affinity\r\nbetween the nobles and the monarch than between the nobles and the\r\npeople, although the higher orders of society have occasionally\r\nresisted the prerogative of the Crown in concert with the lower\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nLawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration,\r\nand the best security of public order is authority. It must not be\r\nforgotten that, if they prize the free institutions of their country\r\nmuch, they nevertheless value the legality of those institutions far\r\nmore: they are less afraid of tyranny than of arbitrary power; and\r\nprovided that the legislature take upon itself to deprive men of their\r\nindependence, they are not dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nI am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence of an\r\nencroaching democracy, should endeavor to impair the judicial authority\r\nin his dominions, and to diminish the political influence of lawyers,\r\nwould commit a great mistake. He would let slip the substance of\r\nauthority to grasp at the shadow. He would act more wisely in\r\nintroducing men connected with the law into the government; and if he\r\nentrusted them with the conduct of a despotic power, bearing some marks\r\nof violence, that power would most likely assume the external features\r\nof justice and of legality in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe government of democracy is favorable to the political power of\r\nlawyers; for when the wealthy, the noble, and the prince are excluded\r\nfrom the government, they are sure to occupy the highest stations, in\r\ntheir own right, as it were, since they are the only men of information\r\nand sagacity, beyond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of\r\nthe popular choice. If, then, they are led by their tastes to combine\r\nwith the aristocracy and to support the Crown, they are naturally\r\nbrought into contact with the people by their interests. They like the\r\ngovernment of democracy, without participating in its propensities and\r\nwithout imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold\r\nauthority, from it and over it. The people in democratic states does\r\nnot mistrust the members of the legal profession, because it is well\r\nknown that they are interested in serving the popular cause; and it\r\nlistens to them without irritation, because it does not attribute to\r\nthem any sinister designs. The object of lawyers is not, indeed, to\r\noverthrow the institutions of democracy, but they constantly endeavor\r\nto give it an impulse which diverts it from its real tendency, by means\r\nwhich are foreign to its nature. Lawyers belong to the people by birth\r\nand interest, to the aristocracy by habit and by taste, and they may be\r\nlooked upon as the natural bond and connecting link of the two great\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\nThe profession of the law is the only aristocratic element which can be\r\namalgamated without violence with the natural elements of democracy,\r\nand which can be advantageously and permanently combined with them. I\r\nam not unacquainted with the defects which are inherent in the\r\ncharacter of that body of men; but without this admixture of\r\nlawyer-like sobriety with the democratic principle, I question whether\r\ndemocratic institutions could long be maintained, and I cannot believe\r\nthat a republic could subsist at the present time if the influence of\r\nlawyers in public business did not increase in proportion to the power\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThis aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal\r\nprofession, is much more distinctly marked in the United States and in\r\nEngland than in any other country. This proceeds not only from the\r\nlegal studies of the English and American lawyers, but from the nature\r\nof the legislation, and the position which those persons occupy in the\r\ntwo countries. The English and the Americans have retained the law of\r\nprecedents; that is to say, they continue to found their legal opinions\r\nand the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and the decisions\r\nof their forefathers. In the mind of an English or American lawyer a\r\ntaste and a reverence for what is old is almost always united to a love\r\nof regular and lawful proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis predisposition has another effect upon the character of the legal\r\nprofession and upon the general course of society. The English and\r\nAmerican lawyers investigate what has been done; the French advocate\r\ninquires what should have been done; the former produce precedents, the\r\nlatter reasons. A French observer is surprised to hear how often an\r\nEnglish dr an American lawyer quotes the opinions of others, and how\r\nlittle he alludes to his own; whilst the reverse occurs in France.\r\nThere the most trifling litigation is never conducted without the\r\nintroduction of an entire system of ideas peculiar to the counsel\r\nemployed; and the fundamental principles of law are discussed in order\r\nto obtain a perch of land by the decision of the court. This abnegation\r\nof his own opinion, and this implicit deference to the opinion of his\r\nforefathers, which are common to the English and American lawyer, this\r\nsubjection of thought which he is obliged to profess, necessarily give\r\nhim more timid habits and more sluggish inclinations in England and\r\nAmerica than in France.\r\n\r\nThe French codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be\r\nread by every one; nothing, on the other hand, can be more impenetrable\r\nto the uninitiated than a legislation founded upon precedents. The\r\nindispensable want of legal assistance which is felt in England and in\r\nthe United States, and the high opinion which is generally entertained\r\nof the ability of the legal profession, tend to separate it more and\r\nmore from the people, and to place it in a distinct class. The French\r\nlawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his\r\ncountry; but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants\r\nof Egypt, for, like them, he is the sole interpreter of an occult\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe station which lawyers occupy in England and America exercises no\r\nless an influence upon their habits and their opinions. The English\r\naristocracy, which has taken care to attract to its sphere whatever is\r\nat all analogous to itself, has conferred a high degree of importance\r\nand of authority upon the members of the legal profession. In English\r\nsociety lawyers do not occupy the first rank, but they are contented\r\nwith the station assigned to them; they constitute, as it were, the\r\nyounger branch of the English aristocracy, and they are attached to\r\ntheir elder brothers, although they do not enjoy all their privileges.\r\nThe English lawyers consequently mingle the taste and the ideas of the\r\naristocratic circles in which they move with the aristocratic interests\r\nof their profession.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the lawyer-like character which I am endeavoring to depict\r\nis most distinctly to be met with in England: there laws are esteemed\r\nnot so much because they are good as because they are old; and if it be\r\nnecessary to modify them in any respect, or to adapt them the changes\r\nwhich time operates in society, recourse is had to the most\r\ninconceivable contrivances in order to uphold the traditionary fabric,\r\nand to maintain that nothing has been done which does not square with\r\nthe intentions and complete the labors of former generations. The very\r\nindividuals who conduct these changes disclaim all intention of\r\ninnovation, and they had rather resort to absurd expedients than plead\r\nguilty to so great a crime. This spirit appertains more especially to\r\nthe English lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what\r\nthey treat, and they direct all their attention to the letter, seeming\r\ninclined to infringe the rules of common sense and of humanity rather\r\nthan to swerve one title from the law. The English legislation may be\r\ncompared to the stock of an old tree, upon which lawyers have engrafted\r\nthe most various shoots, with the hope that, although their fruits may\r\ndiffer, their foliage at least will be confounded with the venerable\r\ntrunk which supports them all.\r\n\r\nIn America there are no nobles or men of letters, and the people is apt\r\nto mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest\r\npolitical class, and the most cultivated circle of society. They have\r\ntherefore nothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative\r\ninterest to their natural taste for public order. If I were asked where\r\nI place the American aristocracy, I should reply without hesitation\r\nthat it is not composed of the rich, who are united together by no\r\ncommon tie, but that it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.\r\n\r\nThe more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States the more\r\nshall we be persuaded that the lawyers as a body form the most\r\npowerful, if not the only, counterpoise to the democratic element. In\r\nthat country we perceive how eminently the legal profession is\r\nqualified by its powers, and even by its defects, to neutralize the\r\nvices which are inherent in popular government. When the American\r\npeople is intoxicated by passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of\r\nits ideas, it is checked and stopped by the almost invisible influence\r\nof its legal counsellors, who secretly oppose their aristocratic\r\npropensities to its democratic instincts, their superstitious\r\nattachment to what is antique to its love of novelty, their narrow\r\nviews to its immense designs, and their habitual procrastination to its\r\nardent impatience.\r\n\r\nThe courts of justice are the most visible organs by which the legal\r\nprofession is enabled to control the democracy. The judge is a lawyer,\r\nwho, independently of the taste for regularity and order which he has\r\ncontracted in the study of legislation, derives an additional love of\r\nstability from his own inalienable functions. His legal attainments\r\nhave already raised him to a distinguished rank amongst his\r\nfellow-citizens; his political power completes the distinction of his\r\nstation, and gives him the inclinations natural to privileged classes.\r\n\r\nArmed with the power of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional, *a\r\nthe American magistrate perpetually interferes in political affairs. He\r\ncannot force the people to make laws, but at least he can oblige it not\r\nto disobey its own enactments; or to act inconsistently with its own\r\nprinciples. I am aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial\r\npower exists in the United States, and by most of the constitutions of\r\nthe several States the Government can, upon the demand of the two\r\nhouses of the legislature, remove the judges from their station. By\r\nsome other constitutions the members of the tribunals are elected, and\r\nthey are even subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict\r\nthat these innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal\r\nconsequences, and that it will be found out at some future period that\r\nthe attack which is made upon the judicial power has affected the\r\ndemocratic republic itself.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ See chapter VI. on the \xe2\x80\x9cJudicial Power in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which I have\r\nbeen speaking has been confined, in the United States, to the courts of\r\njustice; it extends far beyond them. As the lawyers constitute the only\r\nenlightened class which the people does not mistrust, they are\r\nnaturally called upon to occupy most of the public stations. They fill\r\nthe legislative assemblies, and they conduct the administration; they\r\nconsequently exercise a powerful influence upon the formation of the\r\nlaw, and upon its execution. The lawyers are, however, obliged to yield\r\nto the current of public opinion, which is too strong for them to\r\nresist it, but it is easy to find indications of what their conduct\r\nwould be if they were free to act as they chose. The Americans, who\r\nhave made such copious innovations in their political legislation, have\r\nintroduced very sparing alterations in their civil laws, and that with\r\ngreat difficulty, although those laws are frequently repugnant to their\r\nsocial condition. The reason of this is, that in matters of civil law\r\nthe majority is obliged to defer to the authority of the legal\r\nprofession, and that the American lawyers are disinclined to innovate\r\nwhen they are left to their own choice.\r\n\r\nIt is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very different state of\r\nthings, to hear the perpetual complaints which are made in the United\r\nStates against the stationary propensities of legal men, and their\r\nprejudices in favor of existing institutions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the legal habits which are common in America extends\r\nbeyond the limits I have just pointed out. Scarcely any question arises\r\nin the United States which does not become, sooner or later, a subject\r\nof judicial debate; hence all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas,\r\nand even the language, usual in judicial proceedings in their daily\r\ncontroversies. As most public men are, or have been, legal\r\npractitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their\r\nprofession into the affairs of the country. The jury extends this\r\nhabitude to all classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in some\r\nmeasure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the law, which is produced in\r\nthe schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their\r\nwalls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest\r\nclasses, so that the whole people contracts the habits and the tastes\r\nof the magistrate. The lawyers of the United States form a party which\r\nis but little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge\r\npeculiar to itself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to the\r\nexigencies of the time, and accommodates itself to all the movements of\r\nthe social body; but this party extends over the whole community, and\r\nit penetrates into all classes of society; it acts upon the country\r\nimperceptibly, but it finally fashions it to suit its purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVI: Causes Mitigating Tyranny In The United States\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\nTrial By Jury In The United States Considered As A Political\r\nInstitution\r\n\r\nTrial by jury, which is one of the instruments of the sovereignty of\r\nthe people, deserves to be compared with the other laws which establish\r\nthat sovereignty\xe2\x80\x94Composition of the jury in the United States\xe2\x80\x94Effect of\r\ntrial by jury upon the national character\xe2\x80\x94It educates the people\xe2\x80\x94It\r\ntends to establish the authority of the magistrates and to extend a\r\nknowledge of law among the people.\r\n\r\nSince I have been led by my subject to recur to the administration of\r\njustice in the United States, I will not pass over this point without\r\nadverting to the institution of the jury. Trial by jury may be\r\nconsidered in two separate points of view, as a judicial and as a\r\npolitical institution. If it entered into my present purpose to inquire\r\nhow far trial by jury (more especially in civil cases) contributes to\r\ninsure the best administration of justice, I admit that its utility\r\nmight be contested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when\r\nsociety was in an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice were\r\nmerely called upon to decide on the evidence of facts, it is not an\r\neasy task to adapt it to the wants of a highly civilized community when\r\nthe mutual relations of men are multiplied to a surprising extent, and\r\nhave assumed the enlightened and intellectual character of the age. *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial institution, and the\r\nappreciation of its effects in the United States, together with the\r\nadvantages the Americans have derived from it, would suffice to form a\r\nbook, and a book upon a very useful and curious subject. The State of\r\nLouisiana would in particular afford the curious phenomenon of a French\r\nand English legislation, as well as a French and English population,\r\nwhich are gradually combining with each other. See the \xe2\x80\x9cDigeste des\r\nLois de la Louisiane,\xe2\x80\x9d in two volumes; and the \xe2\x80\x9cTraite sur les Regles\r\ndes Actions civiles,\xe2\x80\x9d printed in French and English at New Orleans in\r\n1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy present object is to consider the jury as a political institution,\r\nand any other course would divert me from my subject. Of trial by jury,\r\nconsidered as a judicial institution, I shall here say but very few\r\nwords. When the English adopted trial by jury they were a\r\nsemi-barbarous people; they are become, in course of time, one of the\r\nmost enlightened nations of the earth; and their attachment to this\r\ninstitution seems to have increased with their increasing cultivation.\r\nThey soon spread beyond their insular boundaries to every corner of the\r\nhabitable globe; some have formed colonies, others independent states;\r\nthe mother-country has maintained its monarchical constitution; many of\r\nits offspring have founded powerful republics; but wherever the English\r\nhave been they have boasted of the privilege of trial by jury. *c They\r\nhave established it, or hastened to re-establish it, in all their\r\nsettlements. A judicial institution which obtains the suffrages of a\r\ngreat people for so long a series of ages, which is zealously renewed\r\nat every epoch of civilization, in all the climates of the earth and\r\nunder every form of human government, cannot be contrary to the spirit\r\nof justice. *d\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon this head.\r\nMr. Story, judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, speaks, in\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cTreatise on the Federal Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d of the advantages of trial\r\nby jury in civil cases:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe inestimable privilege of a trial by jury\r\nin civil cases\xe2\x80\x94a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases,\r\nwhich is counted by all persons to be essential to political and civil\r\nliberty. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d (Story, book iii., chap. xxxviii.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ If it were our province to point out the utility of the jury as a\r\njudicial institution in this place, much might be said, and the\r\nfollowing arguments might be brought forward amongst others:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nBy introducing the jury into the business of the courts you are enabled\r\nto diminish the number of judges, which is a very great advantage. When\r\njudges are very numerous, death is perpetually thinning the ranks of\r\nthe judicial functionaries, and laying places vacant for newcomers. The\r\nambition of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they\r\nare naturally made dependent upon the will of the majority, or the\r\nindividual who fills up the vacant appointments; the officers of the\r\ncourt then rise like the officers of an army. This state of things is\r\nentirely contrary to the sound administration of justice, and to the\r\nintentions of the legislator. The office of a judge is made inalienable\r\nin order that he may remain independent: but of what advantage is it\r\nthat his independence should be protected if he be tempted to sacrifice\r\nit of his own accord? When judges are very numerous many of them must\r\nnecessarily be incapable of performing their important duties, for a\r\ngreat magistrate is a man of no common powers; and I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that a half-enlightened tribunal is the worst of all\r\ninstruments for attaining those objects which it is the purpose of\r\ncourts of justice to accomplish. For my own part, I had rather submit\r\nthe decision of a case to ignorant jurors directed by a skilful judge\r\nthan to judges a majority of whom are imperfectly acquainted with\r\njurisprudence and with the laws.]\r\n\r\nI turn, however, from this part of the subject. To look upon the jury\r\nas a mere judicial institution is to confine our attention to a very\r\nnarrow view of it; for however great its influence may be upon the\r\ndecisions of the law courts, that influence is very subordinate to the\r\npowerful effects which it produces on the destinies of the community at\r\nlarge. The jury is above all a political institution, and it must be\r\nregarded in this light in order to be duly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBy the jury I mean a certain number of citizens chosen\r\nindiscriminately, and invested with a temporary right of judging. Trial\r\nby jury, as applied to the repression of crime, appears to me to\r\nintroduce an eminently republican element into the government upon the\r\nfollowing grounds:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic,\r\naccording to the class of society from which the jurors are selected;\r\nbut it always preserves its republican character, inasmuch as it places\r\nthe real direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a\r\nportion of the governed, instead of leaving it under the authority of\r\nthe Government. Force is never more than a transient element of\r\nsuccess; and after force comes the notion of right. A government which\r\nshould only be able to crush its enemies upon a field of battle would\r\nvery soon be destroyed. The true sanction of political laws is to be\r\nfound in penal legislation, and if that sanction be wanting the law\r\nwill sooner or later lose its cogency. He who punishes infractions of\r\nthe law is therefore the real master of society. Now the institution of\r\nthe jury raises the people itself, or at least a class of citizens, to\r\nthe bench of judicial authority. The institution of the jury\r\nconsequently invests the people, or that class of citizens, with the\r\ndirection of society. *e\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ An important remark must, however, be made. Trial by jury does\r\nunquestionably invest the people with a general control over the\r\nactions of citizens, but it does not furnish means of exercising this\r\ncontrol in all cases, or with an absolute authority. When an absolute\r\nmonarch has the right of trying offences by his representatives, the\r\nfate of the prisoner is, as it were, decided beforehand. But even if\r\nthe people were predisposed to convict, the composition and the\r\nnon-responsibility of the jury would still afford some chances\r\nfavorable to the protection of innocence.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of the\r\nnation; *f the aristocracy makes the laws, applies the laws, and\r\npunishes all infractions of the laws; everything is established upon a\r\nconsistent footing, and England may with truth be said to constitute an\r\naristocratic republic. In the United States the same system is applied\r\nto the whole people. Every American citizen is qualified to be an\r\nelector, a juror, and is eligible to office. *g The system of the jury,\r\nas it is understood in America, appears to me to be as direct and as\r\nextreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as universal\r\nsuffrage. These institutions are two instruments of equal power, which\r\ncontribute to the supremacy of the majority. All the sovereigns who\r\nhave chosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society\r\ninstead of obeying its directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the\r\ninstitution of the jury. The monarchs of the House of Tudor sent to\r\nprison jurors who refused to convict, and Napoleon caused them to be\r\nreturned by his agents.\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ [This may be true to some extent of special juries, but not of common\r\njuries. The author seems not to have been aware that the qualifications\r\nof jurors in England vary exceedingly.]]\r\n\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ See Appendix, Q.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever clear most of these truths may seem to be, they do not command\r\nuniversal assent, and in France, at least, the institution of trial by\r\njury is still very imperfectly understood. If the question arises as to\r\nthe proper qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion of\r\nthe intelligence and knowledge of the citizens who may be returned, as\r\nif the jury was merely a judicial institution. This appears to me to be\r\nthe least part of the subject. The jury is pre-eminently a political\r\ninstitution; it must be regarded as one form of the sovereignty of the\r\npeople; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it must be rejected, or it\r\nmust be adapted to the laws by which that sovereignty is established.\r\nThe jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution of the\r\nlaws is entrusted, as the Houses of Parliament constitute that part of\r\nthe nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be\r\ngoverned with consistency and uniformity, the list of citizens\r\nqualified to serve on juries must increase and diminish with the list\r\nof electors. This I hold to be the point of view most worthy of the\r\nattention of the legislator, and all that remains is merely accessory.\r\n\r\nI am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political\r\ninstitution that I still consider it in this light when it is applied\r\nin civil causes. Laws are always unstable unless they are founded upon\r\nthe manners of a nation; manners are the only durable and resisting\r\npower in a people. When the jury is reserved for criminal offences, the\r\npeople only witnesses its occasional action in certain particular\r\ncases; the ordinary course of life goes on without its interference,\r\nand it is considered as an instrument, but not as the only instrument,\r\nof obtaining justice. This is true a fortiori when the jury is only\r\napplied to certain criminal causes.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil\r\ncauses, its application is constantly palpable; it affects all the\r\ninterests of the community; everyone co-operates in its work: it thus\r\npenetrates into all the usages of life, it fashions the human mind to\r\nits peculiar forms, and is gradually associated with the idea of\r\njustice itself.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the jury, if confined to criminal causes, is always\r\nin danger, but when once it is introduced into civil proceedings it\r\ndefies the aggressions of time and of man. If it had been as easy to\r\nremove the jury from the manners as from the laws of England, it would\r\nhave perished under Henry VIII, and Elizabeth, and the civil jury did\r\nin reality, at that period, save the liberties of the country. In\r\nwhatever manner the jury be applied, it cannot fail to exercise a\r\npowerful influence upon the national character; but this influence is\r\nprodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes. The\r\njury, and more especially the jury in civil cases, serves to\r\ncommunicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens;\r\nand this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest\r\npreparation for free institutions. It imbues all classes with a respect\r\nfor the thing judged, and with the notion of right. If these two\r\nelements be removed, the love of independence is reduced to a mere\r\ndestructive passion. It teaches men to practice equity, every man\r\nlearns to judge his neighbor as he would himself be judged; and this is\r\nespecially true of the jury in civil causes, for, whilst the number of\r\npersons who have reason to apprehend a criminal prosecution is small,\r\nevery one is liable to have a civil action brought against him. The\r\njury teaches every man not to recoil before the responsibility of his\r\nown actions, and impresses him with that manly confidence without which\r\npolitical virtue cannot exist. It invests each citizen with a kind of\r\nmagistracy, it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to\r\ndischarge towards society, and the part which they take in the\r\nGovernment. By obliging men to turn their attention to affairs which\r\nare not exclusively their own, it rubs off that individual egotism\r\nwhich is the rust of society.\r\n\r\nThe jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgement and to\r\nincrease the natural intelligence of a people, and this is, in my\r\nopinion, its greatest advantage. It may be regarded as a gratuitous\r\npublic school ever open, in which every juror learns to exercise his\r\nrights, enters into daily communication with the most learned and\r\nenlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes practically\r\nacquainted with the laws of his country, which are brought within the\r\nreach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the\r\njudge, and even by the passions of the parties. I think that the\r\npractical intelligence and political good sense of the Americans are\r\nmainly attributable to the long use which they have made of the jury in\r\ncivil causes. I do not know whether the jury is useful to those who are\r\nin litigation; but I am certain it is highly beneficial to those who\r\ndecide the litigation; and I look upon it as one of the most\r\nefficacious means for the education of the people which society can\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\nWhat I have hitherto said applies to all nations, but the remark I am\r\nnow about to make is peculiar to the Americans and to democratic\r\npeoples. I have already observed that in democracies the members of the\r\nlegal profession and the magistrates constitute the only aristocratic\r\nbody which can check the irregularities of the people. This aristocracy\r\nis invested with no physical power, but it exercises its conservative\r\ninfluence upon the minds of men, and the most abundant source of its\r\nauthority is the institution of the civil jury. In criminal causes,\r\nwhen society is armed against a single individual, the jury is apt to\r\nlook upon the judge as the passive instrument of social power, and to\r\nmistrust his advice. Moreover, criminal causes are entirely founded\r\nupon the evidence of facts which common sense can readily appreciate;\r\nupon this ground the judge and the jury are equal. Such, however, is\r\nnot the case in civil causes; then the judge appears as a disinterested\r\narbiter between the conflicting passions of the parties. The jurors\r\nlook up to him with confidence and listen to him with respect, for in\r\nthis instance their intelligence is completely under the control of his\r\nlearning. It is the judge who sums up the various arguments with which\r\ntheir memory has been wearied out, and who guides them through the\r\ndevious course of the proceedings; he points their attention to the\r\nexact question of fact which they are called upon to solve, and he puts\r\nthe answer to the question of law into their mouths. His influence upon\r\ntheir verdict is almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nIf I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved by the\r\narguments derived from the ignorance of jurors in civil causes, I\r\nreply, that in these proceedings, whenever the question to be solved is\r\nnot a mere question of fact, the jury has only the semblance of a\r\njudicial body. The jury sanctions the decision of the judge, they by\r\nthe authority of society which they represent, and he by that of reason\r\nand of law. *h\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ See Appendix, R.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England and in America the judges exercise an influence upon\r\ncriminal trials which the French judges have never possessed. The\r\nreason of this difference may easily be discovered; the English and\r\nAmerican magistrates establish their authority in civil causes, and\r\nonly transfer it afterwards to tribunals of another kind, where that\r\nauthority was not acquired. In some cases (and they are frequently the\r\nmost important ones) the American judges have the right of deciding\r\ncauses alone. *i Upon these occasions they are accidentally placed in\r\nthe position which the French judges habitually occupy, but they are\r\ninvested with far more power than the latter; they are still surrounded\r\nby the reminiscence of the jury, and their judgment has almost as much\r\nauthority as the voice of the community at large, represented by that\r\ninstitution. Their influence extends beyond the limits of the courts;\r\nin the recreations of private life as well as in the turmoil of public\r\nbusiness, abroad and in the legislative assemblies, the American judge\r\nis constantly surrounded by men who are accustomed to regard his\r\nintelligence as superior to their own, and after having exercised his\r\npower in the decision of causes, he continues to influence the habits\r\nof thought and the characters of the individuals who took a part in his\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ The Federal judges decide upon their own authority almost all the\r\nquestions most important to the country.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magistracy, does\r\nin reality consolidate its power, and in no country are the judges so\r\npowerful as there, where the people partakes their privileges. It is\r\nmore especially by means of the jury in civil causes that the American\r\nmagistrates imbue all classes of society with the spirit of their\r\nprofession. Thus the jury, which is the most energetic means of making\r\nthe people rule, is also the most efficacious means of teaching it to\r\nrule well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic\r\n Republic\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\nPrincipal Causes Which Tend To Maintain The Democratic Republic In The\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nA democratic republic subsists in the United States, and the principal\r\nobject of this book has been to account for the fact of its existence.\r\nSeveral of the causes which contribute to maintain the institutions of\r\nAmerica have been involuntarily passed by or only hinted at as I was\r\nborne along by my subject. Others I have been unable to discuss, and\r\nthose on which I have dwelt most are, as it were, buried in the details\r\nof the former parts of this work. I think, therefore, that before I\r\nproceed to speak of the future, I cannot do better than collect within\r\na small compass the reasons which best explain the present. In this\r\nretrospective chapter I shall be succinct, for I shall take care to\r\nremind the reader very summarily of what he already knows; and I shall\r\nonly select the most prominent of those facts which I have not yet\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nAll the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic\r\nrepublic in the United States are reducible to three heads:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence has placed\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nII. The laws.\r\n\r\nIII. The manners and customs of the people.\r\n\r\nAccidental Or Providential Causes Which Contribute To The Maintenance\r\nOf The Democratic Republic In The United States The Union has no\r\nneighbors\xe2\x80\x94No metropolis\xe2\x80\x94The Americans have had the chances of birth in\r\ntheir favor\xe2\x80\x94America an empty country\xe2\x80\x94How this circumstance contributes\r\npowerfully to the maintenance of the democratic republic in America\xe2\x80\x94How\r\nthe American wilds are peopled\xe2\x80\x94Avidity of the Anglo-Americans in taking\r\npossession of the solitudes of the New World\xe2\x80\x94Influence of physical\r\nprosperity upon the political opinions of the Americans.\r\n\r\nA thousand circumstances, independent of the will of man, concur to\r\nfacilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United\r\nStates. Some of these peculiarities are known, the others may easily be\r\npointed out; but I shall confine myself to the most prominent amongst\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great\r\nwars, or financial crises, or inroads, or conquest to dread; they\r\nrequire neither great taxes, nor great armies, nor great generals; and\r\nthey have nothing to fear from a scourge which is more formidable to\r\nrepublics than all these evils combined, namely, military glory. It is\r\nimpossible to deny the inconceivable influence which military glory\r\nexercises upon the spirit of a nation. General Jackson, whom the\r\nAmericans have twice elected to the head of their Government, is a man\r\nof a violent temper and mediocre talents; no one circumstance in the\r\nwhole course of his career ever proved that he is qualified to govern a\r\nfree people, and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes of the\r\nUnion has always been opposed to him. But he was raised to the\r\nPresidency, and has been maintained in that lofty station, solely by\r\nthe recollection of a victory which he gained twenty years ago under\r\nthe walls of New Orleans, a victory which was, however, a very ordinary\r\nachievement, and which could only be remembered in a country where\r\nbattles are rare. Now the people which is thus carried away by the\r\nillusions of glory is unquestionably the most cold and calculating, the\r\nmost unmilitary (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic of\r\nall the peoples of the earth.\r\n\r\nAmerica has no great capital *a city, whose influence is directly or\r\nindirectly felt over the whole extent of the country, which I hold to\r\nbe one of the first causes of the maintenance of republican\r\ninstitutions in the United States. In cities men cannot be prevented\r\nfrom concerting together, and from awakening a mutual excitement which\r\nprompts sudden and passionate resolutions. Cities may be looked upon as\r\nlarge assemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members; their\r\npopulace exercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and\r\nfrequently executes its own wishes without their intervention.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ The United States have no metropolis, but they already contain\r\nseveral very large cities. Philadelphia reckoned 161,000 inhabitants\r\nand New York 202,000 in the year 1830. The lower orders which inhabit\r\nthese cities constitute a rabble even more formidable than the populace\r\nof European towns. They consist of freed blacks in the first place, who\r\nare condemned by the laws and by public opinion to a hereditary state\r\nof misery and degradation. They also contain a multitude of Europeans\r\nwho have been driven to the shores of the New World by their\r\nmisfortunes or their misconduct; and these men inoculate the United\r\nStates with all our vices, without bringing with them any of those\r\ninterests which counteract their baneful influence. As inhabitants of a\r\ncountry where they have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all the\r\npassions which agitate the community to their own advantage; thus,\r\nwithin the last few months serious riots have broken out in\r\nPhiladelphia and in New York. Disturbances of this kind are unknown in\r\nthe rest of the country, which is nowise alarmed by them, because the\r\npopulation of the cities has hitherto exercised neither power nor\r\ninfluence over the rural districts. Nevertheless, I look upon the size\r\nof certain American cities, and especially on the nature of their\r\npopulation, as a real danger which threatens the future security of the\r\ndemocratic republics of the New World; and I venture to predict that\r\nthey will perish from this circumstance unless the government succeeds\r\nin creating an armed force, which, whilst it remains under the control\r\nof the majority of the nation, will be independent of the town\r\npopulation, and able to repress its excesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The population of the city of New York had risen, in 1870, to 942,292,\r\nand that of Philadelphia to 674,022. Brooklyn, which may be said to\r\nform part of New York city, has a population of 396,099, in addition to\r\nthat of New York. The frequent disturbances in the great cities of\r\nAmerica, and the excessive corruption of their local governments\xe2\x80\x94over\r\nwhich there is no effectual control\xe2\x80\x94are amongst the greatest evils and\r\ndangers of the country.]]\r\n\r\nTo subject the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not only to\r\nplace the destiny of the empire in the hands of a portion of the\r\ncommunity, which may be reprobated as unjust, but to place it in the\r\nhands of a populace acting under its own impulses, which must be\r\navoided as dangerous. The preponderance of capital cities is therefore\r\na serious blow upon the representative system, and it exposes modern\r\nrepublics to the same defect as the republics of antiquity, which all\r\nperished from not having been acquainted with that form of government.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for me to adduce a great number of secondary causes\r\nwhich have contributed to establish, and which concur to maintain, the\r\ndemocratic republic of the United States. But I discern two principal\r\ncircumstances amongst these favorable elements, which I hasten to point\r\nout. I have already observed that the origin of the American\r\nsettlements may be looked upon as the first and most efficacious cause\r\nto which the present prosperity of the United States may be attributed.\r\nThe Americans had the chances of birth in their favor, and their\r\nforefathers imported that equality of conditions into the country\r\nwhence the democratic republic has very naturally taken its rise. Nor\r\nwas this all they did; for besides this republican condition of\r\nsociety, the early settler bequeathed to their descendants those\r\ncustoms, manners, and opinions which contribute most to the success of\r\na republican form of government. When I reflect upon the consequences\r\nof this primary circumstance, methinks I see the destiny of America\r\nembodied in the first Puritan who landed on those shores, just as the\r\nhuman race was represented by the first man.\r\n\r\nThe chief circumstance which has favored the establishment and the\r\nmaintenance of a democratic republic in the United States is the nature\r\nof the territory which the American inhabit. Their ancestors gave them\r\nthe love of equality and of freedom, but God himself gave them the\r\nmeans of remaining equal and free, by placing them upon a boundless\r\ncontinent, which is open to their exertions. General prosperity is\r\nfavorable to the stability of all governments, but more particularly of\r\na democratic constitution, which depends upon the dispositions of the\r\nmajority, and more particularly of that portion of the community which\r\nis most exposed to feel the pressure of want. When the people rules, it\r\nmust be rendered happy, or it will overturn the State, and misery is\r\napt to stimulate it to those excesses to which ambition rouses kings.\r\nThe physical causes, independent of the laws, which contribute to\r\npromote general prosperity, are more numerous in America than they have\r\never been in any other country in the world, at any other period of\r\nhistory. In the United States not only is legislation democratic, but\r\nnature herself favors the cause of the people.\r\n\r\nIn what part of human tradition can be found anything at all similar to\r\nthat which is occurring under our eyes in North America? The celebrated\r\ncommunities of antiquity were all founded in the midst of hostile\r\nnations, which they were obliged to subjugate before they could\r\nflourish in their place. Even the moderns have found, in some parts of\r\nSouth America, vast regions inhabited by a people of inferior\r\ncivilization, but which occupied and cultivated the soil. To found\r\ntheir new states it was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous\r\npopulation, until civilization has been made to blush for their\r\nsuccess. But North America was only inhabited by wandering tribes, who\r\ntook no thought of the natural riches of the soil, and that vast\r\ncountry was still, properly speaking, an empty continent, a desert land\r\nawaiting its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nEverything is extraordinary in America, the social condition of the\r\ninhabitants, as well as the laws; but the soil upon which these\r\ninstitutions are founded is more extraordinary than all the rest. When\r\nman was first placed upon the earth by the Creator, the earth was\r\ninexhaustible in its youth, but man was weak and ignorant; and when he\r\nhad learned to explore the treasures which it contained, hosts of his\r\nfellow creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to earn an\r\nasylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that same period\r\nNorth America was discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by the\r\nDeity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of the deluge.\r\n\r\nThat continent still presents, as it did in the primeval time, rivers\r\nwhich rise from never-failing sources, green and moist solitudes, and\r\nfields which the ploughshare of the husbandman has never turned. In\r\nthis state it is offered to man, not in the barbarous and isolated\r\ncondition of the early ages, but to a being who is already in\r\npossession of the most potent secrets of the natural world, who is\r\nunited to his fellow-men, and instructed by the experience of fifty\r\ncenturies. At this very time thirteen millions of civilized Europeans\r\nare peaceably spreading over those fertile plains, with whose resources\r\nand whose extent they are not yet themselves accurately acquainted.\r\nThree or four thousand soldiers drive the wandering races of the\r\naborigines before them; these are followed by the pioneers, who pierce\r\nthe woods, scare off the beasts of prey, explore the courses of the\r\ninland streams, and make ready the triumphal procession of civilization\r\nacross the waste.\r\n\r\nThe favorable influence of the temporal prosperity of America upon the\r\ninstitutions of that country has been so often described by others, and\r\nadverted to by myself, that I shall not enlarge upon it beyond the\r\naddition of a few facts. An erroneous notion is generally entertained\r\nthat the deserts of America are peopled by European emigrants, who\r\nannually disembark upon the coasts of the New World, whilst the\r\nAmerican population increases and multiplies upon the soil which its\r\nforefathers tilled. The European settler, however, usually arrives in\r\nthe United States without friends, and sometimes without resources; in\r\norder to subsist he is obliged to work for hire, and he rarely proceeds\r\nbeyond that belt of industrious population which adjoins the ocean. The\r\ndesert cannot be explored without capital or credit; and the body must\r\nbe accustomed to the rigors of a new climate before it can be exposed\r\nto the chances of forest life. It is the Americans themselves who daily\r\nquit the spots which gave them birth to acquire extensive domains in a\r\nremote country. Thus the European leaves his cottage for the\r\ntrans-Atlantic shores; and the American, who is born on that very\r\ncoast, plunges in his turn into the wilds of Central America. This\r\ndouble emigration is incessant; it begins in the remotest parts of\r\nEurope, it crosses the Atlantic Ocean, and it advances over the\r\nsolitudes of the New World. Millions of men are marching at once\r\ntowards the same horizon; their language, their religion, their manners\r\ndiffer, their object is the same. The gifts of fortune are promised in\r\nthe West, and to the West they bend their course. *b\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ [The number of foreign immigrants into the United States in the last\r\nfifty years (from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be 7,556,007. Of these,\r\n4,104,553 spoke English\xe2\x80\x94that is, they came from Great Britain, Ireland,\r\nor the British colonies; 2,643,069 came from Germany or northern\r\nEurope; and about half a million from the south of Europe.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human\r\nrace, except perhaps those irruptions which preceded the fall of the\r\nRoman Empire. Then, as well as now, generations of men were impelled\r\nforwards in the same direction to meet and struggle on the same spot;\r\nbut the designs of Providence were not the same; then, every newcomer\r\nwas the harbinger of destruction and of death; now, every adventurer\r\nbrings with him the elements of prosperity and of life. The future\r\nstill conceals from us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of\r\nthe Americans towards the West; but we can readily apprehend its more\r\nimmediate results. As a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the\r\nStates in which they were born, the population of these States\r\nincreases very slowly, although they have long been established: thus\r\nin Connecticut, which only contains fifty-nine inhabitants to the\r\nsquare mile, the population has not increased by more than one-quarter\r\nin forty years, whilst that of England has been augmented by one-third\r\nin the lapse of the same period. The European emigrant always lands,\r\ntherefore, in a country which is but half full, and where hands are in\r\nrequest: he becomes a workman in easy circumstances; his son goes to\r\nseek his fortune in unpeopled regions, and he becomes a rich landowner.\r\nThe former amasses the capital which the latter invests, and the\r\nstranger as well as the native is unacquainted with want.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the United States are extremely favorable to the division\r\nof property; but a cause which is more powerful than the laws prevents\r\nproperty from being divided to excess. *c This is very perceptible in\r\nthe States which are beginning to be thickly peopled; Massachusetts is\r\nthe most populous part of the Union, but it contains only eighty\r\ninhabitants to the square mile, which is must less than in France,\r\nwhere 162 are reckoned to the same extent of country. But in\r\nMassachusetts estates are very rarely divided; the eldest son takes the\r\nland, and the others go to seek their fortune in the desert. The law\r\nhas abolished the rights of primogeniture, but circumstances have\r\nconcurred to re-establish it under a form of which none can complain,\r\nand by which no just rights are impaired.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they are rarely\r\nsubjected to further division.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals\r\nwho leave New England, in this manner, to settle themselves in the\r\nwilds. We were assured in 1830 that thirty-six of the members of\r\nCongress were born in the little State of Connecticut. The population\r\nof Connecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of\r\nthe United States, thus furnished one-eighth of the whole body of\r\nrepresentatives. The States of Connecticut, however, only sends five\r\ndelegates to Congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the new\r\nWestern States. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in\r\nConnecticut, it is probable that instead of becoming rich landowners\r\nthey would have remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in\r\nobscurity without being able to rise into public life, and that, far\r\nfrom becoming useful members of the legislature, they might have been\r\nunruly citizens.\r\n\r\nThese reflections do not escape the observation of the Americans any\r\nmore than of ourselves. \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be doubted,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chancellor Kent in\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cTreatise on American Law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthat the division of landed estates\r\nmust produce great evils when it is carried to such excess as that each\r\nparcel of land is insufficient to support a family; but these\r\ndisadvantages have never been felt in the United States, and many\r\ngenerations must elapse before they can be felt. The extent of our\r\ninhabited territory, the abundance of adjacent land, and the continual\r\nstream of emigration flowing from the shores of the Atlantic towards\r\nthe interior of the country, suffice as yet, and will long suffice, to\r\nprevent the parcelling out of estates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the American rushes\r\nforward to secure the immense booty which fortune proffers to him. In\r\nthe pursuit he fearlessly braves the arrow of the Indian and the\r\ndistempers of the forest; he is unimpressed by the silence of the\r\nwoods; the approach of beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is\r\ngoaded onwards by a passion more intense than the love of life. Before\r\nhim lies a boundless continent, and he urges onwards as if time\r\npressed, and he was afraid of finding no room for his exertions. I have\r\nspoken of the emigration from the older States, but how shall I\r\ndescribe that which takes place from the more recent ones? Fifty years\r\nhave scarcely elapsed since that of Ohio was founded; the greater part\r\nof its inhabitants were not born within its confines; its capital has\r\nonly been built thirty years, and its territory is still covered by an\r\nimmense extent of uncultivated fields; nevertheless the population of\r\nOhio is already proceeding westward, and most of the settlers who\r\ndescend to the fertile savannahs of Illinois are citizens of Ohio.\r\nThese men left their first country to improve their condition; they\r\nquit their resting-place to ameliorate it still more; fortune awaits\r\nthem everywhere, but happiness they cannot attain. The desire of\r\nprosperity is become an ardent and restless passion in their minds\r\nwhich grows by what it gains. They early broke the ties which bound\r\nthem to their natal earth, and they have contracted no fresh ones on\r\ntheir way. Emigration was at first necessary to them as a means of\r\nsubsistence; and it soon becomes a sort of game of chance, which they\r\npursue for the emotions it excites as much as for the gain it procures.\r\n\r\nSometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears\r\nbehind him. The woods stoop to give him a passage, and spring up again\r\nwhen he has passed. It is not uncommon in crossing the new States of\r\nthe West to meet with deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the\r\ntraveller frequently discovers the vestiges of a log house in the most\r\nsolitary retreats, which bear witness to the power, and no less to the\r\ninconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields, and over these ruins of\r\na day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh vegetation, the beasts\r\nresume the haunts which were once their own, and Nature covers the\r\ntraces of man\xe2\x80\x99s path with branches and with flowers, which obliterate\r\nhis evanescent track.\r\n\r\nI remember that, in crossing one of the woodland districts which still\r\ncover the State of New York, I reached the shores of a lake embosomed\r\nin forests coeval with the world. A small island, covered with woods\r\nwhose thick foliage concealed its banks, rose from the centre of the\r\nwaters. Upon the shores of the lake no object attested the presence of\r\nman except a column of smoke which might be seen on the horizon rising\r\nfrom the tops of the trees to the clouds, and seeming to hang from\r\nheaven rather than to be mounting to the sky. An Indian shallop was\r\nhauled up on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet that had\r\nfirst attracted my attention, and in a few minutes I set foot upon its\r\nbanks. The whole island formed one of those delicious solitudes of the\r\nNew World which almost lead civilized man to regret the haunts of the\r\nsavage. A luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the incomparable\r\nfruitfulness of the soil. The deep silence which is common to the wilds\r\nof North America was only broken by the hoarse cooing of the\r\nwood-pigeon, and the tapping of the woodpecker upon the bark of trees.\r\nI was far from supposing that this spot had ever been inhabited, so\r\ncompletely did Nature seem to be left to her own caprices; but when I\r\nreached the centre of the isle I thought that I discovered some traces\r\nof man. I then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with care,\r\nand I soon perceived that a European had undoubtedly been led to seek a\r\nrefuge in this retreat. Yet what changes had taken place in the scene\r\nof his labors! The logs which he had hastily hewn to build himself a\r\nshed had sprouted afresh; the very props were intertwined with living\r\nverdure, and his cabin was transformed into a bower. In the midst of\r\nthese shrubs a few stones were to be seen, blackened with fire and\r\nsprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no doubt been, and the\r\nchimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. I stood for some time\r\nin silent admiration of the exuberance of Nature and the littleness of\r\nman: and when I was obliged to leave that enchanting solitude, I\r\nexclaimed with melancholy, \xe2\x80\x9cAre ruins, then, already here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Europe we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded\r\ndesire of riches, and an excessive love of independence, as\r\npropensities very formidable to society. Yet these are the very\r\nelements which ensure a long and peaceful duration to the republics of\r\nAmerica. Without these unquiet passions the population would collect in\r\ncertain spots, and would soon be subject to wants like those of the Old\r\nWorld, which it is difficult to satisfy; for such is the present good\r\nfortune of the New World, that the vices of its inhabitants are\r\nscarcely less favorable to society than their virtues. These\r\ncircumstances exercise a great influence on the estimation in which\r\nhuman actions are held in the two hemispheres. The Americans frequently\r\nterm what we should call cupidity a laudable industry; and they blame\r\nas faint-heartedness what we consider to be the virtue of moderate\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nIn France, simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the\r\nattachments which men feel to the place of their birth, are looked upon\r\nas great guarantees of the tranquillity and happiness of the State. But\r\nin America nothing seems to be more prejudicial to society than these\r\nvirtues. The French Canadians, who have faithfully preserved the\r\ntraditions of their pristine manners, are already embarrassed for room\r\nupon their small territory; and this little community, which has so\r\nrecently begun to exist, will shortly be a prey to the calamities\r\nincident to old nations. In Canada, the most enlightened, patriotic,\r\nand humane inhabitants make extraordinary efforts to render the people\r\ndissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content it.\r\nThere, the seductions of wealth are vaunted with as much zeal as the\r\ncharms of an honest but limited income in the Old World, and more\r\nexertions are made to excite the passions of the citizens there than to\r\ncalm them elsewhere. If we listen to their eulogies, we shall hear that\r\nnothing is more praiseworthy than to exchange the pure and homely\r\npleasures which even the poor man tastes in his own country for the\r\ndull delights of prosperity under a foreign sky; to leave the\r\npatrimonial hearth and the turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in\r\nshort, to abandon the living and the dead in quest of fortune.\r\n\r\nAt the present time America presents a field for human effort far more\r\nextensive than any sum of labor which can be applied to work it. In\r\nAmerica too much knowledge cannot be diffused; for all knowledge,\r\nwhilst it may serve him who possesses it, turns also to the advantage\r\nof those who are without it. New wants are not to be feared, since they\r\ncan be satisfied without difficulty; the growth of human passions need\r\nnot be dreaded, since all passions may find an easy and a legitimate\r\nobject; nor can men be put in possession of too much freedom, since\r\nthey are scarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties.\r\n\r\nThe American republics of the present day are like companies of\r\nadventurers formed to explore in common the waste lands of the New\r\nWorld, and busied in a flourishing trade. The passions which agitate\r\nthe Americans most deeply are not their political but their commercial\r\npassions; or, to speak more correctly, they introduce the habits they\r\ncontract in business into their political life. They love order,\r\nwithout which affairs do not prosper; and they set an especial value\r\nupon a regular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid business;\r\nthey prefer the good sense which amasses large fortunes to that\r\nenterprising spirit which frequently dissipates them; general ideas\r\nalarm their minds, which are accustomed to positive calculations, and\r\nthey hold practice in more honor than theory.\r\n\r\nIt is in America that one learns to understand the influence which\r\nphysical prosperity exercises over political actions, and even over\r\nopinions which ought to acknowledge no sway but that of reason; and it\r\nis more especially amongst strangers that this truth is perceptible.\r\nMost of the European emigrants to the New World carry with them that\r\nwild love of independence and of change which our calamities are so apt\r\nto engender. I sometimes met with Europeans in the United States who\r\nhad been obliged to leave their own country on account of their\r\npolitical opinions. They all astonished me by the language they held,\r\nbut one of them surprised me more than all the rest. As I was crossing\r\none of the most remote districts of Pennsylvania I was benighted, and\r\nobliged to beg for hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who\r\nwas a Frenchman by birth. He bade me sit down beside his fire, and we\r\nbegan to talk with that freedom which befits persons who meet in the\r\nbackwoods, two thousand leagues from their native country. I was aware\r\nthat my host had been a great leveller and an ardent demagogue forty\r\nyears ago, and that his name was not unknown to fame. I was, therefore,\r\nnot a little surprised to hear him discuss the rights of property as an\r\neconomist or a landowner might have done: he spoke of the necessary\r\ngradations which fortune establishes among men, of obedience to\r\nestablished laws, of the influence of good morals in commonwealths, and\r\nof the support which religious opinions give to order and to freedom;\r\nhe even went to far as to quote an evangelical authority in\r\ncorroboration of one of his political tenets.\r\n\r\nI listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of human reason. A\r\nproposition is true or false, but no art can prove it to be one or the\r\nother, in the midst of the uncertainties of science and the conflicting\r\nlessons of experience, until a new incident disperses the clouds of\r\ndoubt; I was poor, I become rich, and I am not to expect that\r\nprosperity will act upon my conduct, and leave my judgment free; my\r\nopinions change with my fortune, and the happy circumstances which I\r\nturn to my advantage furnish me with that decisive argument which was\r\nbefore wanting. The influence of prosperity acts still more freely upon\r\nthe American than upon strangers. The American has always seen the\r\nconnection of public order and public prosperity, intimately united as\r\nthey are, go on before his eyes; he does not conceive that one can\r\nsubsist without the other; he has therefore nothing to forget; nor has\r\nhe, like so many Europeans, to unlearn the lessons of his early\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic\r\n Republic\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence Of The Laws Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic\r\nIn The United States\r\n\r\nThree principal causes of the maintenance of the democratic\r\nrepublic\xe2\x80\x94Federal Constitutions\xe2\x80\x94Municipal institutions\xe2\x80\x94Judicial power.\r\n\r\nThe principal aim of this book has been to make known the laws of the\r\nUnited States; if this purpose has been accomplished, the reader is\r\nalready enabled to judge for himself which are the laws that really\r\ntend to maintain the democratic republic, and which endanger its\r\nexistence. If I have not succeeded in explaining this in the whole\r\ncourse of my work, I cannot hope to do so within the limits of a single\r\nchapter. It is not my intention to retrace the path I have already\r\npursued, and a very few lines will suffice to recapitulate what I have\r\npreviously explained.\r\n\r\nThree circumstances seem to me to contribute most powerfully to the\r\nmaintenance of the democratic republic in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first is that Federal form of Government which the Americans have\r\nadopted, and which enables the Union to combine the power of a great\r\nempire with the security of a small State.\r\n\r\nThe second consists in those municipal institutions which limit the\r\ndespotism of the majority, and at the same time impart a taste for\r\nfreedom and a knowledge of the art of being free to the people.\r\n\r\nThe third is to be met with in the constitution of the judicial power.\r\nI have shown in what manner the courts of justice serve to repress the\r\nexcesses of democracy, and how they check and direct the impulses of\r\nthe majority without stopping its activity.\r\n\r\nInfluence Of Manners Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In\r\nThe United States\r\n\r\nI have previously remarked that the manners of the people may be\r\nconsidered as one of the general causes to which the maintenance of a\r\ndemocratic republic in the United States is attributable. I here used\r\nthe word manners with the meaning which the ancients attached to the\r\nword mores, for I apply it not only to manners in their proper sense of\r\nwhat constitutes the character of social intercourse, but I extend it\r\nto the various notions and opinions current among men, and to the mass\r\nof those ideas which constitute their character of mind. I comprise,\r\ntherefore, under this term the whole moral and intellectual condition\r\nof a people. My intention is not to draw a picture of American manners,\r\nbut simply to point out such features of them as are favorable to the\r\nmaintenance of political institutions.\r\n\r\nReligion Considered As A Political Institution, Which Powerfully\r\nContributes To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic Amongst The\r\nAmericans\r\n\r\nNorth America peopled by men who professed a democratic and republican\r\nChristianity\xe2\x80\x94Arrival of the Catholics\xe2\x80\x94For what reason the Catholics\r\nform the most democratic and the most republican class at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEvery religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political opinion\r\nwhich is connected with it by affinity. If the human mind be left to\r\nfollow its own bent, it will regulate the temporal and spiritual\r\ninstitutions of society upon one uniform principle; and man will\r\nendeavor, if I may use the expression, to harmonize the state in which\r\nhe lives upon earth with the state which he believes to await him in\r\nheaven. The greatest part of British America was peopled by men who,\r\nafter having shaken off the authority of the Pope, acknowledged no\r\nother religious supremacy; they brought with them into the New World a\r\nform of Christianity which I cannot better describe than by styling it\r\na democratic and republican religion. This sect contributed powerfully\r\nto the establishment of a democracy and a republic, and from the\r\nearliest settlement of the emigrants politics and religion contracted\r\nan alliance which has never been dissolved.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a Catholic population into\r\nthe United States; on the other hand, the Catholics of America made\r\nproselytes, and at the present moment more than a million of Christians\r\nprofessing the truths of the Church of Rome are to be met with in the\r\nUnion. *d The Catholics are faithful to the observances of their\r\nreligion; they are fervent and zealous in the support and belief of\r\ntheir doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the most republican and\r\nthe most democratic class of citizens which exists in the United\r\nStates; and although this fact may surprise the observer at first, the\r\ncauses by which it is occasioned may easily be discovered upon\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ [It is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the amount of the Roman\r\nCatholic population of the United States, but in 1868 an able writer in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cEdinburgh Review\xe2\x80\x9d (vol. cxxvii. p. 521) affirmed that the whole\r\nCatholic population of the United States was then about 4,000,000,\r\ndivided into 43 dioceses, with 3,795 churches, under the care of 45\r\nbishops and 2,317 clergymen. But this rapid increase is mainly\r\nsupported by immigration from the Catholic countries of Europe.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that the Catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as\r\nthe natural enemy of democracy. Amongst the various sects of\r\nChristians, Catholicism seems to me, on the contrary, to be one of\r\nthose which are most favorable to the equality of conditions. In the\r\nCatholic Church, the religious community is composed of only two\r\nelements, the priest and the people. The priest alone rises above the\r\nrank of his flock, and all below him are equal.\r\n\r\nOn doctrinal points the Catholic faith places all human capacities upon\r\nthe same level; it subjects the wise and ignorant, the man of genius\r\nand the vulgar crowd, to the details of the same creed; it imposes the\r\nsame observances upon the rich and needy, it inflicts the same\r\nausterities upon the strong and the weak, it listens to no compromise\r\nwith mortal man, but, reducing all the human race to the same standard,\r\nit confounds all the distinctions of society at the foot of the same\r\naltar, even as they are confounded in the sight of God. If Catholicism\r\npredisposes the faithful to obedience, it certainly does not prepare\r\nthem for inequality; but the contrary may be said of Protestantism,\r\nwhich generally tends to make men independent, more than to render them\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nCatholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign be removed,\r\nall the other classes of society are more equal than they are in\r\nrepublics. It has not unfrequently occurred that the Catholic priest\r\nhas left the service of the altar to mix with the governing powers of\r\nsociety, and to take his place amongst the civil gradations of men.\r\nThis religious influence has sometimes been used to secure the\r\ninterests of that political state of things to which he belonged. At\r\nother times Catholics have taken the side of aristocracy from a spirit\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the government,\r\nas is the case in the United States, than is found that no class of men\r\nare more naturally disposed than the Catholics to transfuse the\r\ndoctrine of the equality of conditions into the political world. If,\r\nthen, the Catholic citizens of the United States are not forcibly led\r\nby the nature of their tenets to adopt democratic and republican\r\nprinciples, at least they are not necessarily opposed to them; and\r\ntheir social position, as well as their limited number, obliges them to\r\nadopt these opinions. Most of the Catholics are poor, and they have no\r\nchance of taking a part in the government unless it be open to all the\r\ncitizens. They constitute a minority, and all rights must be respected\r\nin order to insure to them the free exercise of their own privileges.\r\nThese two causes induce them, unconsciously, to adopt political\r\ndoctrines, which they would perhaps support with less zeal if they were\r\nrich and preponderant.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic clergy of the United States has never attempted to oppose\r\nthis political tendency, but it seeks rather to justify its results.\r\nThe priests in America have divided the intellectual world into two\r\nparts: in the one they place the doctrines of revealed religion, which\r\ncommand their assent; in the other they leave those truths which they\r\nbelieve to have been freely left open to the researches of political\r\ninquiry. Thus the Catholics of the United States are at the same time\r\nthe most faithful believers and the most zealous citizens.\r\n\r\nIt may be asserted that in the United States no religious doctrine\r\ndisplays the slightest hostility to democratic and republican\r\ninstitutions. The clergy of all the different sects hold the same\r\nlanguage, their opinions are consonant to the laws, and the human\r\nintellect flows onwards in one sole current.\r\n\r\nI happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the Union, when\r\nI was invited to attend a public meeting which had been called for the\r\npurpose of assisting the Poles, and of sending them supplies of arms\r\nand money. I found two or three thousand persons collected in a vast\r\nhall which had been prepared to receive them. In a short time a priest\r\nin his ecclesiastical robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the\r\nspectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst he spoke in the following\r\nterms:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmighty God! the God of Armies! Thou who didst strengthen the hearts\r\nand guide the arms of our fathers when they were fighting for the\r\nsacred rights of national independence; Thou who didst make them\r\ntriumph over a hateful oppression, and hast granted to our people the\r\nbenefits of liberty and peace; Turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the\r\nother hemisphere; pitifully look down upon that heroic nation which is\r\neven now struggling as we did in the former time, and for the same\r\nrights which we defended with our blood. Thou, who didst create Man in\r\nthe likeness of the same image, let not tyranny mar Thy work, and\r\nestablish inequality upon the earth. Almighty God! do Thou watch over\r\nthe destiny of the Poles, and render them worthy to be free. May Thy\r\nwisdom direct their councils, and may Thy strength sustain their arms!\r\nShed forth Thy terror over their enemies, scatter the powers which take\r\ncounsel against them; and vouchsafe that the injustice which the world\r\nhas witnessed for fifty years, be not consummated in our time. O Lord,\r\nwho holdest alike the hearts of nations and of men in Thy powerful\r\nhand; raise up allies to the sacred cause of right; arouse the French\r\nnation from the apathy in which its rulers retain it, that it go forth\r\nagain to fight for the liberties of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, turn not Thou Thy face from us, and grant that we may always be\r\nthe most religious as well as the freest people of the earth. Almighty\r\nGod, hear our supplications this day. Save the Poles, we beseech Thee,\r\nin the name of Thy well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died\r\nupon the cross for the salvation of men. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole meeting responded \xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d with devotion.\r\n\r\nIndirect Influence Of Religious Opinions Upon Political Society In The\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nChristian morality common to all sects\xe2\x80\x94Influence of religion upon the\r\nmanners of the Americans\xe2\x80\x94Respect for the marriage tie\xe2\x80\x94In what manner\r\nreligion confines the imagination of the Americans within certain\r\nlimits, and checks the passion of innovation\xe2\x80\x94Opinion of the Americans\r\non the political utility of religion\xe2\x80\x94Their exertions to extend and\r\nsecure its predominance.\r\n\r\nI have just shown what the direct influence of religion upon politics\r\nis in the United States, but its indirect influence appears to me to be\r\nstill more considerable, and it never instructs the Americans more\r\nfully in the art of being free than when it says nothing of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe sects which exist in the United States are innumerable. They all\r\ndiffer in respect to the worship which is due from man to his Creator,\r\nbut they all agree in respect to the duties which are due from man to\r\nman. Each sect adores the Deity in its own peculiar manner, but all the\r\nsects preach the same moral law in the name of God. If it be of the\r\nhighest importance to man, as an individual, that his religion should\r\nbe true, the case of society is not the same. Society has no future\r\nlife to hope for or to fear; and provided the citizens profess a\r\nreligion, the peculiar tenets of that religion are of very little\r\nimportance to its interests. Moreover, almost all the sects of the\r\nUnited States are comprised within the great unity of Christianity, and\r\nChristian morality is everywhere the same.\r\n\r\nIt may be believed without unfairness that a certain number of\r\nAmericans pursue a peculiar form of worship, from habit more than from\r\nconviction. In the United States the sovereign authority is religious,\r\nand consequently hypocrisy must be common; but there is no country in\r\nthe whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater\r\ninfluence over the souls of men than in America; and there can be no\r\ngreater proof of its utility, and of its conformity to human nature,\r\nthan that its influence is most powerfully felt over the most\r\nenlightened and free nation of the earth.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the members of the American clergy in general,\r\nwithout even excepting those who do not admit religious liberty, are\r\nall in favor of civil freedom; but they do not support any particular\r\npolitical system. They keep aloof from parties and from public affairs.\r\nIn the United States religion exercises but little influence upon the\r\nlaws and upon the details of public opinion, but it directs the manners\r\nof the community, and by regulating domestic life it regulates the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nI do not question that the great austerity of manners which is\r\nobservable in the United States, arises, in the first instance, from\r\nreligious faith. Religion is often unable to restrain man from the\r\nnumberless temptations of fortune; nor can it check that passion for\r\ngain which every incident of his life contributes to arouse, but its\r\ninfluence over the mind of woman is supreme, and women are the\r\nprotectors of morals. There is certainly no country in the world where\r\nthe tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or where\r\nconjugal happiness is more highly or worthily appreciated. In Europe\r\nalmost all the disturbances of society arise from the irregularities of\r\ndomestic life. To despise the natural bonds and legitimate pleasures of\r\nhome, is to contract a taste for excesses, a restlessness of heart, and\r\nthe evil of fluctuating desires. Agitated by the tumultuous passions\r\nwhich frequently disturb his dwelling, the European is galled by the\r\nobedience which the legislative powers of the State exact. But when the\r\nAmerican retires from the turmoil of public life to the bosom of his\r\nfamily, he finds in it the image of order and of peace. There his\r\npleasures are simple and natural, his joys are innocent and calm; and\r\nas he finds that an orderly life is the surest path to happiness, he\r\naccustoms himself without difficulty to moderate his opinions as well\r\nas his tastes. Whilst the European endeavors to forget his domestic\r\ntroubles by agitating society, the American derives from his own home\r\nthat love of order which he afterwards carries with him into public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the influence of religion is not confined to the\r\nmanners, but it extends to the intelligence of the people. Amongst the\r\nAnglo-Americans, there are some who profess the doctrines of\r\nChristianity from a sincere belief in them, and others who do the same\r\nbecause they are afraid to be suspected of unbelief. Christianity,\r\ntherefore, reigns without any obstacle, by universal consent; the\r\nconsequence is, as I have before observed, that every principle of the\r\nmoral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is\r\nabandoned to the debates and the experiments of men. Thus the human\r\nmind is never left to wander across a boundless field; and, whatever\r\nmay be its pretensions, it is checked from time to time by barriers\r\nwhich it cannot surmount. Before it can perpetrate innovation, certain\r\nprimal and immutable principles are laid down, and the boldest\r\nconceptions of human device are subjected to certain forms which retard\r\nand stop their completion.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of the Americans, even in its greatest flights, is\r\ncircumspect and undecided; its impulses are checked, and its works\r\nunfinished. These habits of restraint recur in political society, and\r\nare singularly favorable both to the tranquillity of the people and to\r\nthe durability of the institutions it has established. Nature and\r\ncircumstances concurred to make the inhabitants of the United States\r\nbold men, as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit with\r\nwhich they seek for fortune. If the mind of the Americans were free\r\nfrom all trammels, they would very shortly become the most daring\r\ninnovators and the most implacable disputants in the world. But the\r\nrevolutionists of America are obliged to profess an ostensible respect\r\nfor Christian morality and equity, which does not easily permit them to\r\nviolate the laws that oppose their designs; nor would they find it easy\r\nto surmount the scruples of their partisans, even if they were able to\r\nget over their own. Hitherto no one in the United States has dared to\r\nadvance the maxim, that everything is permissible with a view to the\r\ninterests of society; an impious adage which seems to have been\r\ninvented in an age of freedom to shelter all the tyrants of future\r\nages. Thus whilst the law permits the Americans to do what they please,\r\nreligion prevents them from conceiving, and forbids them to commit,\r\nwhat is rash or unjust.\r\n\r\nReligion in America takes no direct part in the government of society,\r\nbut it must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political\r\ninstitutions of that country; for if it does not impart a taste for\r\nfreedom, it facilitates the use of free institutions. Indeed, it is in\r\nthis same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States\r\nthemselves look upon religious belief. I do not know whether all the\r\nAmericans have a sincere faith in their religion, for who can search\r\nthe human heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable\r\nto the maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is not\r\npeculiar to a class of citizens or to a party, but it belongs to the\r\nwhole nation, and to every rank of society.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, if a political character attacks a sect, this may\r\nnot prevent even the partisans of that very sect from supporting him;\r\nbut if he attacks all the sects together, everyone abandons him, and he\r\nremains alone.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was in America, a witness, who happened to be called at the\r\nassizes of the county of Chester (State of New York), declared that he\r\ndid not believe in the existence of God, or in the immortality of the\r\nsoul. The judge refused to admit his evidence, on the ground that the\r\nwitness had destroyed beforehand all the confidence of the Court in\r\nwhat he was about to say. *e The newspapers related the fact without\r\nany further comment.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ The New York \xe2\x80\x9cSpectator\xe2\x80\x9d of August 23, 1831, relates the fact in the\r\nfollowing terms:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court of Common Pleas of Chester county (New\r\nYork) a few days since rejected a witness who declared his disbelief in\r\nthe existence of God. The presiding judge remarked that he had not\r\nbefore been aware that there was a man living who did not believe in\r\nthe existence of God; that this belief constituted the sanction of all\r\ntestimony in a court of justice, and that he knew of no cause in a\r\nChristian country where a witness had been permitted to testify without\r\nsuch belief.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so\r\nintimately in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive\r\nthe one without the other; and with them this conviction does not\r\nspring from that barren traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in\r\nthe soul rather than to live.\r\n\r\nI have known of societies formed by the Americans to send out ministers\r\nof the Gospel into the new Western States to found schools and churches\r\nthere, lest religion should be suffered to die away in those remote\r\nsettlements, and the rising States be less fitted to enjoy free\r\ninstitutions than the people from which they emanated. I met with\r\nwealthy New Englanders who abandoned the country in which they were\r\nborn in order to lay the foundations of Christianity and of freedom on\r\nthe banks of the Missouri, or in the prairies of Illinois. Thus\r\nreligious zeal is perpetually stimulated in the United States by the\r\nduties of patriotism. These men do not act from an exclusive\r\nconsideration of the promises of a future life; eternity is only one\r\nmotive of their devotion to the cause; and if you converse with these\r\nmissionaries of Christian civilization, you will be surprised to find\r\nhow much value they set upon the goods of this world, and that you meet\r\nwith a politician where you expected to find a priest. They will tell\r\nyou that \xe2\x80\x9call the American republics are collectively involved with\r\neach other; if the republics of the West were to fall into anarchy, or\r\nto be mastered by a despot, the republican institutions which now\r\nflourish upon the shores of the Atlantic Ocean would be in great peril.\r\nIt is, therefore, our interest that the new States should be religious,\r\nin order to maintain our liberties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch are the opinions of the Americans, and if any hold that the\r\nreligious spirit which I admire is the very thing most amiss in\r\nAmerica, and that the only element wanting to the freedom and happiness\r\nof the human race is to believe in some blind cosmogony, or to assert\r\nwith Cabanis the secretion of thought by the brain, I can only reply\r\nthat those who hold this language have never been in America, and that\r\nthey have never seen a religious or a free nation. When they return\r\nfrom their expedition, we shall hear what they have to say.\r\n\r\nThere are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as a\r\ntemporary means of power, of wealth, and distinction; men who are the\r\ncondottieri of liberty, and who fight for their own advantage, whatever\r\nbe the colors they wear: it is not to these that I address myself. But\r\nthere are others who look forward to the republican form of government\r\nas a tranquil and lasting state, towards which modern society is daily\r\nimpelled by the ideas and manners of the time, and who sincerely desire\r\nto prepare men to be free. When these men attack religious opinions,\r\nthey obey the dictates of their passions to the prejudice of their\r\ninterests. Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.\r\nReligion is much more necessary in the republic which they set forth in\r\nglowing colors than in the monarchy which they attack; and it is more\r\nneeded in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible\r\nthat society should escape destruction if the moral tie be not\r\nstrengthened in proportion as the political tie is relaxed? and what\r\ncan be done with a people which is its own master, if it be not\r\nsubmissive to the Divinity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic\r\n Republic\xe2\x80\x94Part III\r\n\r\n\r\nPrincipal Causes Which Render Religion Powerful In America Care taken\r\nby the Americans to separate the Church from the State\xe2\x80\x94The laws, public\r\nopinion, and even the exertions of the clergy concur to promote this\r\nend\xe2\x80\x94Influence of religion upon the mind in the United States\r\nattributable to this cause\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94What is the natural state of\r\nmen with regard to religion at the present time\xe2\x80\x94What are the peculiar\r\nand incidental causes which prevent men, in certain countries, from\r\narriving at this state.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay\r\nof religious faith in a very simple manner. Religious zeal, said they,\r\nmust necessarily fail, the more generally liberty is established and\r\nknowledge diffused. Unfortunately, facts are by no means in accordance\r\nwith their theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose\r\nunbelief is only equalled by their ignorance and their debasement,\r\nwhilst in America one of the freest and most enlightened nations in the\r\nworld fulfils all the outward duties of religious fervor.\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the\r\ncountry was the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer I\r\nstayed there the more did I perceive the great political consequences\r\nresulting from this state of things, to which I was unaccustomed. In\r\nFrance I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit\r\nof freedom pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in\r\nAmerica I found that they were intimately united, and that they reigned\r\nin common over the same country. My desire to discover the causes of\r\nthis phenomenon increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it I\r\nquestioned the members of all the different sects; and I more\r\nespecially sought the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries\r\nof the different persuasions, and who are more especially interested in\r\ntheir duration. As a member of the Roman Catholic Church I was more\r\nparticularly brought into contact with several of its priests, with\r\nwhom I became intimately acquainted. To each of these men I expressed\r\nmy astonishment and I explained my doubts; I found that they differed\r\nupon matters of detail alone; and that they mainly attributed the\r\npeaceful dominion of religion in their country to the separation of\r\nChurch and State. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in\r\nAmerica I did not meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of\r\nthe laity, who was not of the same opinion upon this point.\r\n\r\nThis led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done, the\r\nstation which the American clergy occupy in political society. I\r\nlearned with surprise that they filled no public appointments; *f not\r\none of them is to be met with in the administration, and they are not\r\neven represented in the legislative assemblies. In several States *g\r\nthe law excludes them from political life, public opinion in all. And\r\nwhen I came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy I found\r\nthat most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the\r\nexercise of power, and that they made it the pride of their profession\r\nto abstain from politics.\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ Unless this term be applied to the functions which many of them fill\r\nin the schools. Almost all education is entrusted to the clergy.]\r\n\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ See the Constitution of New York, art. 7, Section 4:\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cAnd whereas\r\nthe ministers of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to the\r\nservice of God and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted from\r\nthe great duties of their functions: therefore no minister of the\r\ngospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time\r\nhereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible to,\r\nor capable of holding, any civil or military office or place within\r\nthis State.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also the constitutions of North Carolina, art. 31; Virginia; South\r\nCarolina, art. I, Section 23; Kentucky, art. 2, Section 26; Tennessee,\r\nart. 8, Section I; Louisiana, art. 2, Section 22.]\r\n\r\nI heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever\r\npolitical opinions these vices might chance to lurk; but I learned from\r\ntheir discourses that men are not guilty in the eye of God for any\r\nopinions concerning political government which they may profess with\r\nsincerity, any more than they are for their mistakes in building a\r\nhouse or in driving a furrow. I perceived that these ministers of the\r\ngospel eschewed all parties with the anxiety attendant upon personal\r\ninterest. These facts convinced me that what I had been told was true;\r\nand it then became my object to investigate their causes, and to\r\ninquire how it happened that the real authority of religion was\r\nincreased by a state of things which diminished its apparent force:\r\nthese causes did not long escape my researches.\r\n\r\nThe short space of threescore years can never content the imagination\r\nof man; nor can the imperfect joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man\r\nalone, of all created beings, displays a natural contempt of existence,\r\nand yet a boundless desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads\r\nannihilation. These different feelings incessantly urge his soul to the\r\ncontemplation of a future state, and religion directs his musings\r\nthither. Religion, then, is simply another form of hope; and it is no\r\nless natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot abandon\r\ntheir religious faith without a kind of aberration of intellect, and a\r\nsort of violent distortion of their true natures; but they are\r\ninvincibly brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is an\r\naccident, and faith is the only permanent state of mankind. If we only\r\nconsider religious institutions in a purely human point of view, they\r\nmay be said to derive an inexhaustible element of strength from man\r\nhimself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nI am aware that at certain times religion may strengthen this\r\ninfluence, which originates in itself, by the artificial power of the\r\nlaws, and by the support of those temporal institutions which direct\r\nsociety. Religions, intimately united to the governments of the earth,\r\nhave been known to exercise a sovereign authority derived from the\r\ntwofold source of terror and of faith; but when a religion contracts an\r\nalliance of this nature, I do not hesitate to affirm that it commits\r\nthe same error as a man who should sacrifice his future to his present\r\nwelfare; and in obtaining a power to which it has no claim, it risks\r\nthat authority which is rightfully its own. When a religion founds its\r\nempire upon the desire of immortality which lives in every human heart,\r\nit may aspire to universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a\r\ngovernment, it must necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable\r\nto certain nations. Thus, in forming an alliance with a political\r\npower, religion augments its authority over a few, and forfeits the\r\nhope of reigning over all.\r\n\r\nAs long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the\r\nconsolation of all affliction, it may attract the affections of\r\nmankind. But if it be mixed up with the bitter passions of the world,\r\nit may be constrained to defend allies whom its interests, and not the\r\nprinciple of love, have given to it; or to repel as antagonists men who\r\nare still attached to its own spirit, however opposed they may be to\r\nthe powers to which it is allied. The Church cannot share the temporal\r\npower of the State without being the object of a portion of that\r\nanimosity which the latter excites.\r\n\r\nThe political powers which seem to be most firmly established have\r\nfrequently no better guarantee for their duration than the opinions of\r\na generation, the interests of the time, or the life of an individual.\r\nA law may modify the social condition which seems to be most fixed and\r\ndeterminate; and with the social condition everything else must change.\r\nThe powers of society are more or less fugitive, like the years which\r\nwe spend upon the earth; they succeed each other with rapidity, like\r\nthe fleeting cares of life; and no government has ever yet been founded\r\nupon an invariable disposition of the human heart, or upon an\r\nimperishable interest.\r\n\r\nAs long as a religion is sustained by those feelings, propensities, and\r\npassions which are found to occur under the same forms, at all the\r\ndifferent periods of history, it may defy the efforts of time; or at\r\nleast it can only be destroyed by another religion. But when religion\r\nclings to the interests of the world, it becomes almost as fragile a\r\nthing as the powers of earth. It is the only one of them all which can\r\nhope for immortality; but if it be connected with their ephemeral\r\nauthority, it shares their fortunes, and may fall with those transient\r\npassions which supported them for a day. The alliance which religion\r\ncontracts with political powers must needs be onerous to itself; since\r\nit does not require their assistance to live, and by giving them its\r\nassistance to live, and by giving them its assistance it may be exposed\r\nto decay.\r\n\r\nThe danger which I have just pointed out always exists, but it is not\r\nalways equally visible. In some ages governments seem to be\r\nimperishable; in others, the existence of society appears to be more\r\nprecarious than the life of man. Some constitutions plunge the citizens\r\ninto a lethargic somnolence, and others rouse them to feverish\r\nexcitement. When governments appear to be so strong, and laws so\r\nstable, men do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union\r\nof Church and State. When governments display so much weakness, and\r\nlaws so much inconstancy, the danger is self-evident, but it is no\r\nlonger possible to avoid it; to be effectual, measures must be taken to\r\ndiscover its approach.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of society,\r\nand as communities display democratic propensities, it becomes more and\r\nmore dangerous to connect religion with political institutions; for the\r\ntime is coming when authority will be bandied from hand to hand, when\r\npolitical theories will succeed each other, and when men, laws, and\r\nconstitutions will disappear, or be modified from day to day, and this,\r\nnot for a season only, but unceasingly. Agitation and mutability are\r\ninherent in the nature of democratic republics, just as stagnation and\r\ninertness are the law of absolute monarchies.\r\n\r\nIf the Americans, who change the head of the Government once in four\r\nyears, who elect new legislators every two years, and renew the\r\nprovincial officers every twelvemonth; if the Americans, who have\r\nabandoned the political world to the attempts of innovators, had not\r\nplaced religion beyond their reach, where could it abide in the ebb and\r\nflow of human opinions? where would that respect which belongs to it be\r\npaid, amidst the struggles of faction? and what would become of its\r\nimmortality, in the midst of perpetual decay? The American clergy were\r\nthe first to perceive this truth, and to act in conformity with it.\r\nThey saw that they must renounce their religious influence, if they\r\nwere to strive for political power; and they chose to give up the\r\nsupport of the State, rather than to share its vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nIn America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been at\r\ncertain periods in the history of certain peoples; but its influence is\r\nmore lasting. It restricts itself to its own resources, but of those\r\nnone can deprive it: its circle is limited to certain principles, but\r\nthose principles are entirely its own, and under its undisputed\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nOn every side in Europe we hear voices complaining of the absence of\r\nreligious faith, and inquiring the means of restoring to religion some\r\nremnant of its pristine authority. It seems to me that we must first\r\nattentively consider what ought to be the natural state of men with\r\nregard to religion at the present time; and when we know what we have\r\nto hope and to fear, we may discern the end to which our efforts ought\r\nto be directed.\r\n\r\nThe two great dangers which threaten the existence of religions are\r\nschism and indifference. In ages of fervent devotion, men sometimes\r\nabandon their religion, but they only shake it off in order to adopt\r\nanother. Their faith changes the objects to which it is directed, but\r\nit suffers no decline. The old religion then excites enthusiastic\r\nattachment or bitter enmity in either party; some leave it with anger,\r\nothers cling to it with increased devotedness, and although persuasions\r\ndiffer, irreligion is unknown. Such, however, is not the case when a\r\nreligious belief is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be\r\ntermed negative, since they deny the truth of one religion without\r\naffirming that of any other. Progidious revolutions then take place in\r\nthe human mind, without the apparent co-operation of the passions of\r\nman, and almost without his knowledge. Men lose the objects of their\r\nfondest hopes, as if through forgetfulness. They are carried away by an\r\nimperceptible current which they have not the courage to stem, but\r\nwhich they follow with regret, since it bears them from a faith they\r\nlove, to a scepticism that plunges them into despair.\r\n\r\nIn ages which answer to this description, men desert their religious\r\nopinions from lukewarmness rather than from dislike; they do not reject\r\nthem, but the sentiments by which they were once fostered disappear.\r\nBut if the unbeliever does not admit religion to be true, he still\r\nconsiders it useful. Regarding religious institutions in a human point\r\nof view, he acknowledges their influence upon manners and legislation.\r\nHe admits that they may serve to make men live in peace with one\r\nanother, and to prepare them gently for the hour of death. He regrets\r\nthe faith which he has lost; and as he is deprived of a treasure which\r\nhe has learned to estimate at its full value, he scruples to take it\r\nfrom those who still possess it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who continue to believe are not afraid openly\r\nto avow their faith. They look upon those who do not share their\r\npersuasion as more worthy of pity than of opposition; and they are\r\naware that to acquire the esteem of the unbelieving, they are not\r\nobliged to follow their example. They are hostile to no one in the\r\nworld; and as they do not consider the society in which they live as an\r\narena in which religion is bound to face its thousand deadly foes, they\r\nlove their contemporaries, whilst they condemn their weaknesses and\r\nlament their errors.\r\n\r\nAs those who do not believe, conceal their incredulity; and as those\r\nwho believe, display their faith, public opinion pronounces itself in\r\nfavor of religion: love, support, and honor are bestowed upon it, and\r\nit is only by searching the human soul that we can detect the wounds\r\nwhich it has received. The mass of mankind, who are never without the\r\nfeeling of religion, do not perceive anything at variance with the\r\nestablished faith. The instinctive desire of a future life brings the\r\ncrowd about the altar, and opens the hearts of men to the precepts and\r\nconsolations of religion.\r\n\r\nBut this picture is not applicable to us: for there are men amongst us\r\nwho have ceased to believe in Christianity, without adopting any other\r\nreligion; others who are in the perplexities of doubt, and who already\r\naffect not to believe; and others, again, who are afraid to avow that\r\nChristian faith which they still cherish in secret.\r\n\r\nAmidst these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists a small number\r\nof believers exist, who are ready to brave all obstacles and to scorn\r\nall dangers in defence of their faith. They have done violence to human\r\nweakness, in order to rise superior to public opinion. Excited by the\r\neffort they have made, they scarcely knew where to stop; and as they\r\nknow that the first use which the French made of independence was to\r\nattack religion, they look upon their contemporaries with dread, and\r\nthey recoil in alarm from the liberty which their fellow-citizens are\r\nseeking to obtain. As unbelief appears to them to be a novelty, they\r\ncomprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. They are at\r\nwar with their age and country, and they look upon every opinion which\r\nis put forth there as the necessary enemy of the faith.\r\n\r\nSuch is not the natural state of men with regard to religion at the\r\npresent day; and some extraordinary or incidental cause must be at work\r\nin France to prevent the human mind from following its original\r\npropensities and to drive it beyond the limits at which it ought\r\nnaturally to stop. I am intimately convinced that this extraordinary\r\nand incidental cause is the close connection of politics and religion.\r\nThe unbelievers of Europe attack the Christians as their political\r\nopponents, rather than as their religious adversaries; they hate the\r\nChristian religion as the opinion of a party, much more than as an\r\nerror of belief; and they reject the clergy less because they are the\r\nrepresentatives of the Divinity than because they are the allies of\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Christianity has been intimately united to the powers of the\r\nearth. Those powers are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried\r\nunder their ruins. The living body of religion has been bound down to\r\nthe dead corpse of superannuated polity: cut but the bonds which\r\nrestrain it, and that which is alive will rise once more. I know not\r\nwhat could restore the Christian Church of Europe to the energy of its\r\nearlier days; that power belongs to God alone; but it may be the effect\r\nof human policy to leave the faith in the full exercise of the strength\r\nwhich it still retains.\r\n\r\nHow The Instruction, The Habits, And The Practical Experience Of The\r\nAmericans Promote The Success Of Their Democratic Institutions\r\n\r\nWhat is to be understood by the instruction of the American people\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nhuman mind more superficially instructed in the United States than in\r\nEurope\xe2\x80\x94No one completely uninstructed\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94Rapidity with\r\nwhich opinions are diffused even in the uncultivated States of the\r\nWest\xe2\x80\x94Practical experience more serviceable to the Americans than\r\nbook-learning.\r\n\r\nI have but little to add to what I have already said concerning the\r\ninfluence which the instruction and the habits of the Americans\r\nexercise upon the maintenance of their political institutions.\r\n\r\nAmerica has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it\r\npossesses no great historians, and not a single eminent poet. The\r\ninhabitants of that country look upon what are properly styled literary\r\npursuits with a kind of disapprobation; and there are towns of very\r\nsecond-rate importance in Europe in which more literary works are\r\nannually published than in the twenty-four States of the Union put\r\ntogether. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general ideas; and\r\nit does not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics nor\r\nmanufactures direct them to these occupations; and although new laws\r\nare perpetually enacted in the United States, no great writers have\r\nhitherto inquired into the general principles of their legislation. The\r\nAmericans have lawyers and commentators, but no jurists; *h and they\r\nfurnish examples rather than lessons to the world. The same observation\r\napplies to the mechanical arts. In America, the inventions of Europe\r\nare adopted with sagacity; they are perfected, and adapted with\r\nadmirable skill to the wants of the country. Manufactures exist, but\r\nthe science of manufacture is not cultivated; and they have good\r\nworkmen, but very few inventors. Fulton was obliged to proffer his\r\nservices to foreign nations for a long time before he was able to\r\ndevote them to his own country.\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ [This cannot be said with truth of the country of Kent, Story, and\r\nWheaton.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observer who is desirous of forming an opinion on the state of\r\ninstruction amongst the Anglo-Americans must consider the same object\r\nfrom two different points of view. If he only singles out the learned,\r\nhe will be astonished to find how rare they are; but if he counts the\r\nignorant, the American people will appear to be the most enlightened\r\ncommunity in the world. The whole population, as I observed in another\r\nplace, is situated between these two extremes. In New England, every\r\ncitizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge; he is\r\nmoreover taught the doctrines and the evidences of his religion, the\r\nhistory of his country, and the leading features of its Constitution.\r\nIn the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is extremely rare to\r\nfind a man imperfectly acquainted with all these things, and a person\r\nwholly ignorant of them is a sort of phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWhen I compare the Greek and Roman republics with these American\r\nStates; the manuscript libraries of the former, and their rude\r\npopulation, with the innumerable journals and the enlightened people of\r\nthe latter; when I remember all the attempts which are made to judge\r\nthe modern republics by the assistance of those of antiquity, and to\r\ninfer what will happen in our time from what took place two thousand\r\nyears ago, I am tempted to burn my books, in order to apply none but\r\nnovel ideas to so novel a condition of society.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said of New England must not, however, be applied\r\nindistinctly to the whole Union; as we advance towards the West or the\r\nSouth, the instruction of the people diminishes. In the States which\r\nare adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, a certain number of individuals may\r\nbe found, as in our own countries, who are devoid of the rudiments of\r\ninstruction. But there is not a single district in the United States\r\nsunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple reason: the peoples\r\nof Europe started from the darkness of a barbarous condition, to\r\nadvance toward the light of civilization; their progress has been\r\nunequal; some of them have improved apace, whilst others have loitered\r\nin their course, and some have stopped, and are still sleeping upon the\r\nway. *i\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ [In the Northern States the number of persons destitute of\r\ninstruction is inconsiderable, the largest number being 241,152 in the\r\nState of New York (according to Spaulding\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHandbook of American\r\nStatistics\xe2\x80\x9d for 1874); but in the South no less than 1,516,339 whites\r\nand 2,671,396 colored persons are returned as \xe2\x80\x9cilliterate.\xe2\x80\x9d]]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch has not been the case in the United States. The Anglo-Americans\r\nsettled in a state of civilization, upon that territory which their\r\ndescendants occupy; they had not to begin to learn, and it was\r\nsufficient for them not to forget. Now the children of these same\r\nAmericans are the persons who, year by year, transport their dwellings\r\ninto the wilds; and with their dwellings their acquired information and\r\ntheir esteem for knowledge. Education has taught them the utility of\r\ninstruction, and has enabled them to transmit that instruction to their\r\nposterity. In the United States society has no infancy, but it is born\r\nin man\xe2\x80\x99s estate.\r\n\r\nThe Americans never use the word \xe2\x80\x9cpeasant,\xe2\x80\x9d because they have no idea\r\nof the peculiar class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more\r\nremote ages, the simplicity of rural life, and the rusticity of the\r\nvillager have not been preserved amongst them; and they are alike\r\nunacquainted with the virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the\r\nsimple graces of an early stage of civilization. At the extreme borders\r\nof the Confederate States, upon the confines of society and of the\r\nwilderness, a population of bold adventurers have taken up their abode,\r\nwho pierce the solitudes of the American woods, and seek a country\r\nthere, in order to escape that poverty which awaited them in their\r\nnative provinces. As soon as the pioneer arrives upon the spot which is\r\nto serve him for a retreat, he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse.\r\nNothing can offer a more miserable aspect than these isolated\r\ndwellings. The traveller who approaches one of them towards nightfall,\r\nsees the flicker of the hearth-flame through the chinks in the walls;\r\nand at night, if the wind rises, he hears the roof of boughs shake to\r\nand fro in the midst of the great forest trees. Who would not suppose\r\nthat this poor hut is the asylum of rudeness and ignorance? Yet no sort\r\nof comparison can be drawn between the pioneer and the dwelling which\r\nshelters him. Everything about him is primitive and unformed, but he is\r\nhimself the result of the labor and the experience of eighteen\r\ncenturies. He wears the dress, and he speaks the language of cities; he\r\nis acquainted with the past, curious of the future, and ready for\r\nargument upon the present; he is, in short, a highly civilized being,\r\nwho consents, for a time, to inhabit the backwoods, and who penetrates\r\ninto the wilds of the New World with the Bible, an axe, and a file of\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public\r\nopinion circulates in the midst of these deserts. *j I do not think\r\nthat so much intellectual intercourse takes place in the most\r\nenlightened and populous districts of France. *k It cannot be doubted\r\nthat, in the United States, the instruction of the people powerfully\r\ncontributes to the support of a democratic republic; and such must\r\nalways be the case, I believe, where instruction which awakens the\r\nunderstanding is not separated from moral education which amends the\r\nheart. But I by no means exaggerate this benefit, and I am still\r\nfurther from thinking, as so many people do think in Europe, that men\r\ncan be instantaneously made citizens by teaching them to read and\r\nwrite. True information is mainly derived from experience; and if the\r\nAmericans had not been gradually accustomed to govern themselves, their\r\nbook-learning would not assist them much at the present day.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ I travelled along a portion of the frontier of the United States in a\r\nsort of cart which was termed the mail. We passed, day and night, with\r\ngreat rapidity along the roads which were scarcely marked out, through\r\nimmense forests; when the gloom of the woods became impenetrable the\r\ncoachman lighted branches of fir, and we journeyed along by the light\r\nthey cast. From time to time we came to a hut in the midst of the\r\nforest, which was a post-office. The mail dropped an enormous bundle of\r\nletters at the door of this isolated dwelling, and we pursued our way\r\nat full gallop, leaving the inhabitants of the neighboring log houses\r\nto send for their share of the treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[When the author visited America the locomotive and the railroad were\r\nscarcely invented, and not yet introduced in the United States. It is\r\nsuperfluous to point out the immense effect of those inventions in\r\nextending civilization and developing the resources of that vast\r\ncontinent. In 1831 there were 51 miles of railway in the United States;\r\nin 1872 there were 60,000 miles of railway.]]\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ In 1832 each inhabitant of Michigan paid a sum equivalent to 1 fr. 22\r\ncent. (French money) to the post-office revenue, and each inhabitant of\r\nthe Floridas paid 1 fr. 5 cent. (See \xe2\x80\x9cNational Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d 1833, p.\r\n244.) In the same year each inhabitant of the Departement du Nord paid\r\n1 fr. 4 cent. to the revenue of the French post-office. (See the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompte rendu de l\xe2\x80\x99administration des Finances,\xe2\x80\x9d 1833, p. 623.) Now the\r\nState of Michigan only contained at that time 7 inhabitants per square\r\nleague and Florida only 5: the public instruction and the commercial\r\nactivity of these districts is inferior to that of most of the States\r\nin the Union, whilst the Departement du Nord, which contains 3,400\r\ninhabitants per square league, is one of the most enlightened and\r\nmanufacturing parts of France.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have lived a great deal with the people in the United States, and I\r\ncannot express how much I admire their experience and their good sense.\r\nAn American should never be allowed to speak of Europe; for he will\r\nthen probably display a vast deal of presumption and very foolish\r\npride. He will take up with those crude and vague notions which are so\r\nuseful to the ignorant all over the world. But if you question him\r\nrespecting his own country, the cloud which dimmed his intelligence\r\nwill immediately disperse; his language will become as clear and as\r\nprecise as his thoughts. He will inform you what his rights are, and by\r\nwhat means he exercises them; he will be able to point out the customs\r\nwhich obtain in the political world. You will find that he is well\r\nacquainted with the rules of the administration, and that he is\r\nfamiliar with the mechanism of the laws. The citizen of the United\r\nStates does not acquire his practical science and his positive notions\r\nfrom books; the instruction he has acquired may have prepared him for\r\nreceiving those ideas, but it did not furnish them. The American learns\r\nto know the laws by participating in the act of legislation; and he\r\ntakes a lesson in the forms of government from governing. The great\r\nwork of society is ever going on beneath his eyes, and, as it were,\r\nunder his hands.\r\n\r\nIn the United States politics are the end and aim of education; in\r\nEurope its principal object is to fit men for private life. The\r\ninterference of the citizens in public affairs is too rare an\r\noccurrence for it to be anticipated beforehand. Upon casting a glance\r\nover society in the two hemispheres, these differences are indicated\r\neven by its external aspect.\r\n\r\nIn Europe we frequently introduce the ideas and the habits of private\r\nlife into public affairs; and as we pass at once from the domestic\r\ncircle to the government of the State, we may frequently be heard to\r\ndiscuss the great interests of society in the same manner in which we\r\nconverse with our friends. The Americans, on the other hand, transfuse\r\nthe habits of public life into their manners in private; and in their\r\ncountry the jury is introduced into the games of schoolboys, and\r\nparliamentary forms are observed in the order of a feast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic\r\n Republic\xe2\x80\x94Part IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Laws Contribute More To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic\r\nIn The United States Than The Physical Circumstances Of The Country,\r\nAnd The Manners More Than The Laws\r\n\r\nAll the nations of America have a democratic state of society\xe2\x80\x94Yet\r\ndemocratic institutions only subsist amongst the Anglo-Americans\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nSpaniards of South America, equally favored by physical causes as the\r\nAnglo-Americans, unable to maintain a democratic republic\xe2\x80\x94Mexico, which\r\nhas adopted the Constitution of the United States, in the same\r\npredicament\xe2\x80\x94The Anglo-Americans of the West less able to maintain it\r\nthan those of the East\xe2\x80\x94Reason of these different results.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the maintenance of democratic institutions in the\r\nUnited States is attributable to the circumstances, the laws, and the\r\nmanners of that country. *l Most Europeans are only acquainted with the\r\nfirst of these three causes, and they are apt to give it a\r\npreponderating importance which it does not really possess.\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ I remind the reader of the general signification which I give to the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cmanners,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the moral and intellectual characteristics of\r\nsocial man taken collectively.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Anglo-Saxons settled in the New World in a state of\r\nsocial equality; the low-born and the noble were not to be found\r\namongst them; and professional prejudices were always as entirely\r\nunknown as the prejudices of birth. Thus, as the condition of society\r\nwas democratic, the empire of democracy was established without\r\ndifficulty. But this circumstance is by no means peculiar to the United\r\nStates; almost all the trans-Atlantic colonies were founded by men\r\nequal amongst themselves, or who became so by inhabiting them. In no\r\none part of the New World have Europeans been able to create an\r\naristocracy. Nevertheless, democratic institutions prosper nowhere but\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nThe American Union has no enemies to contend with; it stands in the\r\nwilds like an island in the ocean. But the Spaniards of South America\r\nwere no less isolated by nature; yet their position has not relieved\r\nthem from the charge of standing armies. They make war upon each other\r\nwhen they have no foreign enemies to oppose; and the Anglo-American\r\ndemocracy is the only one which has hitherto been able to maintain\r\nitself in peace. *m\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ [A remark which, since the great Civil War of 1861-65, ceases to be\r\napplicable.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human\r\nactivity, and inexhaustible materials for industry and labor. The\r\npassion of wealth takes the place of ambition, and the warmth of\r\nfaction is mitigated by a sense of prosperity. But in what portion of\r\nthe globe shall we meet with more fertile plains, with mightier rivers,\r\nor with more unexplored and inexhaustible riches than in South America?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, South America has been unable to maintain democratic\r\ninstitutions. If the welfare of nations depended on their being placed\r\nin a remote position, with an unbounded space of habitable territory\r\nbefore them, the Spaniards of South America would have no reason to\r\ncomplain of their fate. And although they might enjoy less prosperity\r\nthan the inhabitants of the United States, their lot might still be\r\nsuch as to excite the envy of some nations in Europe. There are,\r\nhowever, no nations upon the face of the earth more miserable than\r\nthose of South America.\r\n\r\nThus, not only are physical causes inadequate to produce results\r\nanalogous to those which occur in North America, but they are unable to\r\nraise the population of South America above the level of European\r\nStates, where they act in a contrary direction. Physical causes do not,\r\ntherefore, affect the destiny of nations so much as has been supposed.\r\n\r\nI have met with men in New England who were on the point of leaving a\r\ncountry, where they might have remained in easy circumstances, to go to\r\nseek their fortune in the wilds. Not far from that district I found a\r\nFrench population in Canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow\r\nterritory, although the same wilds were at hand; and whilst the\r\nemigrant from the United States purchased an extensive estate with the\r\nearnings of a short term of labor, the Canadian paid as much for land\r\nas he would have done in France. Nature offers the solitudes of the New\r\nWorld to Europeans; but they are not always acquainted with the means\r\nof turning her gifts to account. Other peoples of America have the same\r\nphysical conditions of prosperity as the Anglo-Americans, but without\r\ntheir laws and their manners; and these peoples are wretched. The laws\r\nand manners of the Anglo-Americans are therefore that efficient cause\r\nof their greatness which is the object of my inquiry.\r\n\r\nI am far from supposing that the American laws are preeminently good in\r\nthemselves; I do not hold them to be applicable to all democratic\r\npeoples; and several of them seem to be dangerous, even in the United\r\nStates. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the American\r\nlegislation, taken collectively, is extremely well adapted to the\r\ngenius of the people and the nature of the country which it is intended\r\nto govern. The American laws are therefore good, and to them must be\r\nattributed a large portion of the success which attends the government\r\nof democracy in America: but I do not believe them to be the principal\r\ncause of that success; and if they seem to me to have more influence\r\nupon the social happiness of the Americans than the nature of the\r\ncountry, on the other hand there is reason to believe that their effect\r\nis still inferior to that produced by the manners of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Federal laws undoubtedly constitute the most important part of the\r\nlegislation of the United States. Mexico, which is not less fortunately\r\nsituated than the Anglo-American Union, has adopted the same laws, but\r\nis unable to accustom itself to the government of democracy. Some other\r\ncause is therefore at work, independently of those physical\r\ncircumstances and peculiar laws which enable the democracy to rule in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAnother still more striking proof may be adduced. Almost all the\r\ninhabitants of the territory of the Union are the descendants of a\r\ncommon stock; they speak the same language, they worship God in the\r\nsame manner, they are affected by the same physical causes, and they\r\nobey the same laws. Whence, then, do their characteristic differences\r\narise? Why, in the Eastern States of the Union, does the republican\r\ngovernment display vigor and regularity, and proceed with mature\r\ndeliberation? Whence does it derive the wisdom and the durability which\r\nmark its acts, whilst in the Western States, on the contrary, society\r\nseems to be ruled by the powers of chance? There, public business is\r\nconducted with an irregularity and a passionate and feverish\r\nexcitement, which does not announce a long or sure duration.\r\n\r\nI am no longer comparing the Anglo-American States to foreign nations;\r\nbut I am contrasting them with each other, and endeavoring to discover\r\nwhy they are so unlike. The arguments which are derived from the nature\r\nof the country and the difference of legislation are here all set\r\naside. Recourse must be had to some other cause; and what other cause\r\ncan there be except the manners of the people?\r\n\r\nIt is in the Eastern States that the Anglo-Americans have been longest\r\naccustomed to the government of democracy, and that they have adopted\r\nthe habits and conceived the notions most favorable to its maintenance.\r\nDemocracy has gradually penetrated into their customs, their opinions,\r\nand the forms of social intercourse; it is to be found in all the\r\ndetails of daily life equally as in the laws. In the Eastern States the\r\ninstruction and practical education of the people have been most\r\nperfected, and religion has been most thoroughly amalgamated with\r\nliberty. Now these habits, opinions, customs, and convictions are\r\nprecisely the constituent elements of that which I have denominated\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nIn the Western States, on the contrary, a portion of the same\r\nadvantages is still wanting. Many of the Americans of the West were\r\nborn in the woods, and they mix the ideas and the customs of savage\r\nlife with the civilization of their parents. Their passions are more\r\nintense; their religious morality less authoritative; and their\r\nconvictions less secure. The inhabitants exercise no sort of control\r\nover their fellow-citizens, for they are scarcely acquainted with each\r\nother. The nations of the West display, to a certain extent, the\r\ninexperience and the rude habits of a people in its infancy; for\r\nalthough they are composed of old elements, their assemblage is of\r\nrecent date.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the Americans of the United States are, then, the real\r\ncause which renders that people the only one of the American nations\r\nthat is able to support a democratic government; and it is the\r\ninfluence of manners which produces the different degrees of order and\r\nof prosperity that may be distinguished in the several Anglo-American\r\ndemocracies. Thus the effect which the geographical position of a\r\ncountry may have upon the duration of democratic institutions is\r\nexaggerated in Europe. Too much importance is attributed to\r\nlegislation, too little to manners. These three great causes serve, no\r\ndoubt, to regulate and direct the American democracy; but if they were\r\nto be classed in their proper order, I should say that the physical\r\ncircumstances are less efficient than the laws, and the laws very\r\nsubordinate to the manners of the people. I am convinced that the most\r\nadvantageous situation and the best possible laws cannot maintain a\r\nconstitution in spite of the manners of a country; whilst the latter\r\nmay turn the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws to some\r\nadvantage. The importance of manners is a common truth to which study\r\nand experience incessantly direct our attention. It may be regarded as\r\na central point in the range of human observation, and the common\r\ntermination of all inquiry. So seriously do I insist upon this head,\r\nthat if I have hitherto failed in making the reader feel the important\r\ninfluence which I attribute to the practical experience, the habits,\r\nthe opinions, in short, to the manners of the Americans, upon the\r\nmaintenance of their institutions, I have failed in the principal\r\nobject of my work.\r\n\r\nWhether Laws And Manners Are Sufficient To Maintain Democratic\r\nInstitutions In Other Countries Besides America\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans, if transported into Europe, would be obliged to\r\nmodify their laws\xe2\x80\x94Distinction to be made between democratic\r\ninstitutions and American institutions\xe2\x80\x94Democratic laws may be conceived\r\nbetter than, or at least different from, those which the American\r\ndemocracy has adopted\xe2\x80\x94The example of America only proves that it is\r\npossible to regulate democracy by the assistance of manners and\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nI have asserted that the success of democratic institutions in the\r\nUnited States is more intimately connected with the laws themselves,\r\nand the manners of the people, than with the nature of the country. But\r\ndoes it follow that the same causes would of themselves produce the\r\nsame results, if they were put into operation elsewhere; and if the\r\ncountry is no adequate substitute for laws and manners, can laws and\r\nmanners in their turn prove a substitute for the country? It will\r\nreadily be understood that the necessary elements of a reply to this\r\nquestion are wanting: other peoples are to be found in the New World\r\nbesides the Anglo-Americans, and as these people are affected by the\r\nsame physical circumstances as the latter, they may fairly be compared\r\ntogether. But there are no nations out of America which have adopted\r\nthe same laws and manners, being destitute of the physical advantages\r\npeculiar to the Anglo-Americans. No standard of comparison therefore\r\nexists, and we can only hazard an opinion upon this subject.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, in the first place, that a careful distinction must\r\nbe made between the institutions of the United States and democratic\r\ninstitutions in general. When I reflect upon the state of Europe, its\r\nmighty nations, its populous cities, its formidable armies, and the\r\ncomplex nature of its politics, I cannot suppose that even the\r\nAnglo-Americans, if they were transported to our hemisphere, with their\r\nideas, their religion, and their manners, could exist without\r\nconsiderably altering their laws. But a democratic nation may be\r\nimagined, organized differently from the American people. It is not\r\nimpossible to conceive a government really established upon the will of\r\nthe majority; but in which the majority, repressing its natural\r\npropensity to equality, should consent, with a view to the order and\r\nthe stability of the State, to invest a family or an individual with\r\nall the prerogatives of the executive. A democratic society might\r\nexist, in which the forces of the nation would be more centralized than\r\nthey are in the United States; the people would exercise a less direct\r\nand less irresistible influence upon public affairs, and yet every\r\ncitizen invested with certain rights would participate, within his\r\nsphere, in the conduct of the government. The observations I made\r\namongst the Anglo-Americans induce me to believe that democratic\r\ninstitutions of this kind, prudently introduced into society, so as\r\ngradually to mix with the habits and to be interfused with the opinions\r\nof the people, might subsist in other countries besides America. If the\r\nlaws of the United States were the only imaginable democratic laws, or\r\nthe most perfect which it is possible to conceive, I should admit that\r\nthe success of those institutions affords no proof of the success of\r\ndemocratic institutions in general, in a country less favored by\r\nnatural circumstances. But as the laws of America appear to me to be\r\ndefective in several respects, and as I can readily imagine others of\r\nthe same general nature, the peculiar advantages of that country do not\r\nprove that democratic institutions cannot succeed in a nation less\r\nfavored by circumstances, if ruled by better laws.\r\n\r\nIf human nature were different in America from what it is elsewhere; or\r\nif the social condition of the Americans engendered habits and opinions\r\namongst them different from those which originate in the same social\r\ncondition in the Old World, the American democracies would afford no\r\nmeans of predicting what may occur in other democracies. If the\r\nAmericans displayed the same propensities as all other democratic\r\nnations, and if their legislators had relied upon the nature of the\r\ncountry and the favor of circumstances to restrain those propensities\r\nwithin due limits, the prosperity of the United States would be\r\nexclusively attributable to physical causes, and it would afford no\r\nencouragement to a people inclined to imitate their example, without\r\nsharing their natural advantages. But neither of these suppositions is\r\nborne out by facts.\r\n\r\nIn America the same passions are to be met with as in Europe; some\r\noriginating in human nature, others in the democratic condition of\r\nsociety. Thus in the United States I found that restlessness of heart\r\nwhich is natural to men, when all ranks are nearly equal and the\r\nchances of elevation are the same to all. I found the democratic\r\nfeeling of envy expressed under a thousand different forms. I remarked\r\nthat the people frequently displayed, in the conduct of affairs, a\r\nconsummate mixture of ignorance and presumption; and I inferred that in\r\nAmerica, men are liable to the same failings and the same absurdities\r\nas amongst ourselves. But upon examining the state of society more\r\nattentively, I speedily discovered that the Americans had made great\r\nand successful efforts to counteract these imperfections of human\r\nnature, and to correct the natural defects of democracy. Their divers\r\nmunicipal laws appeared to me to be a means of restraining the ambition\r\nof the citizens within a narrow sphere, and of turning those same\r\npassions which might have worked havoc in the State, to the good of the\r\ntownship or the parish. The American legislators have succeeded to a\r\ncertain extent in opposing the notion of rights to the feelings of\r\nenvy; the permanence of the religious world to the continual shifting\r\nof politics; the experience of the people to its theoretical ignorance;\r\nand its practical knowledge of business to the impatience of its\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, then, have not relied upon the nature of their country\r\nto counterpoise those dangers which originate in their Constitution and\r\nin their political laws. To evils which are common to all democratic\r\npeoples they have applied remedies which none but themselves had ever\r\nthought of before; and although they were the first to make the\r\nexperiment, they have succeeded in it.\r\n\r\nThe manners and laws of the Americans are not the only ones which may\r\nsuit a democratic people; but the Americans have shown that it would be\r\nwrong to despair of regulating democracy by the aid of manners and of\r\nlaws. If other nations should borrow this general and pregnant idea\r\nfrom the Americans, without however intending to imitate them in the\r\npeculiar application which they have made of it; if they should attempt\r\nto fit themselves for that social condition, which it seems to be the\r\nwill of Providence to impose upon the generations of this age, and so\r\nto escape from the despotism or the anarchy which threatens them; what\r\nreason is there to suppose that their efforts would not be crowned with\r\nsuccess? The organization and the establishment of democracy in\r\nChristendom is the great political problem of the time. The Americans,\r\nunquestionably, have not resolved this problem, but they furnish useful\r\ndata to those who undertake the task.\r\n\r\nImportance Of What Precedes With Respect To The State Of Europe\r\n\r\nIt may readily be discovered with what intention I undertook the\r\nforegoing inquiries. The question here discussed is interesting not\r\nonly to the United States, but to the whole world; it concerns, not a\r\nnation, but all mankind. If those nations whose social condition is\r\ndemocratic could only remain free as long as they are inhabitants of\r\nthe wilds, we could not but despair of the future destiny of the human\r\nrace; for democracy is rapidly acquiring a more extended sway, and the\r\nwilds are gradually peopled with men. If it were true that laws and\r\nmanners are insufficient to maintain democratic institutions, what\r\nrefuge would remain open to the nations, except the despotism of a\r\nsingle individual? I am aware that there are many worthy persons at the\r\npresent time who are not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who\r\nare so tired of liberty as to be glad of repose, far from those storms\r\nby which it is attended. But these individuals are ill acquainted with\r\nthe haven towards which they are bound. They are so deluded by their\r\nrecollections, as to judge the tendency of absolute power by what it\r\nwas formerly, and not by what it might become at the present time.\r\n\r\nIf absolute power were re-established amongst the democratic nations of\r\nEurope, I am persuaded that it would assume a new form, and appear\r\nunder features unknown to our forefathers. There was a time in Europe\r\nwhen the laws and the consent of the people had invested princes with\r\nalmost unlimited authority; but they scarcely ever availed themselves\r\nof it. I do not speak of the prerogatives of the nobility, of the\r\nauthority of supreme courts of justice, of corporations and their\r\nchartered rights, or of provincial privileges, which served to break\r\nthe blows of the sovereign authority, and to maintain a spirit of\r\nresistance in the nation. Independently of these political\r\ninstitutions\xe2\x80\x94which, however opposed they might be to personal liberty,\r\nserved to keep alive the love of freedom in the mind of the public, and\r\nwhich may be esteemed to have been useful in this respect\xe2\x80\x94the manners\r\nand opinions of the nation confined the royal authority within barriers\r\nwhich were not less powerful, although they were less conspicuous.\r\nReligion, the affections of the people, the benevolence of the prince,\r\nthe sense of honor, family pride, provincial prejudices, custom, and\r\npublic opinion limited the power of kings, and restrained their\r\nauthority within an invisible circle. The constitution of nations was\r\ndespotic at that time, but their manners were free. Princes had the\r\nright, but they had neither the means nor the desire, of doing whatever\r\nthey pleased.\r\n\r\nBut what now remains of those barriers which formerly arrested the\r\naggressions of tyranny? Since religion has lost its empire over the\r\nsouls of men, the most prominent boundary which divided good from evil\r\nis overthrown; the very elements of the moral world are indeterminate;\r\nthe princes and the peoples of the earth are guided by chance, and none\r\ncan define the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of license.\r\nLong revolutions have forever destroyed the respect which surrounded\r\nthe rulers of the State; and since they have been relieved from the\r\nburden of public esteem, princes may henceforward surrender themselves\r\nwithout fear to the seductions of arbitrary power.\r\n\r\nWhen kings find that the hearts of their subjects are turned towards\r\nthem, they are clement, because they are conscious of their strength,\r\nand they are chary of the affection of their people, because the\r\naffection of their people is the bulwark of the throne. A mutual\r\ninterchange of good-will then takes place between the prince and the\r\npeople, which resembles the gracious intercourse of domestic society.\r\nThe subjects may murmur at the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s decree, but they are grieved\r\nto displease him; and the sovereign chastises his subjects with the\r\nlight hand of parental affection.\r\n\r\nBut when once the spell of royalty is broken in the tumult of\r\nrevolution; when successive monarchs have crossed the throne, so as\r\nalternately to display to the people the weakness of their right and\r\nthe harshness of their power, the sovereign is no longer regarded by\r\nany as the Father of the State, and he is feared by all as its master.\r\nIf he be weak, he is despised; if he be strong, he is detested. He\r\nhimself is full of animosity and alarm; he finds that he is as a\r\nstranger in his own country, and he treats his subjects like conquered\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nWhen the provinces and the towns formed so many different nations in\r\nthe midst of their common country, each of them had a will of its own,\r\nwhich was opposed to the general spirit of subjection; but now that all\r\nthe parts of the same empire, after having lost their immunities, their\r\ncustoms, their prejudices, their traditions, and their names, are\r\nsubjected and accustomed to the same laws, it is not more difficult to\r\noppress them collectively than it was formerly to oppress them singly.\r\n\r\nWhilst the nobles enjoyed their power, and indeed long after that power\r\nwas lost, the honor of aristocracy conferred an extraordinary degree of\r\nforce upon their personal opposition. They afford instances of men who,\r\nnotwithstanding their weakness, still entertained a high opinion of\r\ntheir personal value, and dared to cope single-handed with the efforts\r\nof the public authority. But at the present day, when all ranks are\r\nmore and more confounded, when the individual disappears in the throng,\r\nand is easily lost in the midst of a common obscurity, when the honor\r\nof monarchy has almost lost its empire without being succeeded by\r\npublic virtue, and when nothing can enable man to rise above himself,\r\nwho shall say at what point the exigencies of power and the servility\r\nof weakness will stop?\r\n\r\nAs long as family feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of oppression\r\nwas never alone; he looked about him, and found his clients, his\r\nhereditary friends, and his kinsfolk. If this support was wanting, he\r\nwas sustained by his ancestors and animated by his posterity. But when\r\npatrimonial estates are divided, and when a few years suffice to\r\nconfound the distinctions of a race, where can family feeling be found?\r\nWhat force can there be in the customs of a country which has changed\r\nand is still perpetually changing, its aspect; in which every act of\r\ntyranny has a precedent, and every crime an example; in which there is\r\nnothing so old that its antiquity can save it from destruction, and\r\nnothing so unparalleled that its novelty can prevent it from being\r\ndone? What resistance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make\r\nthat they have already often yielded? What strength can even public\r\nopinion have retained, when no twenty persons are connected by a common\r\ntie; when not a man, nor a family, nor chartered corporation, nor\r\nclass, nor free institution, has the power of representing or exerting\r\nthat opinion; and when every citizen\xe2\x80\x94being equally weak, equally poor,\r\nand equally dependent\xe2\x80\x94has only his personal impotence to oppose to the\r\norganized force of the government?\r\n\r\nThe annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the condition in\r\nwhich that country might then be thrown. But it may more aptly be\r\nassimilated to the times of old, and to those hideous eras of Roman\r\noppression, when the manners of the people were corrupted, their\r\ntraditions obliterated, their habits destroyed, their opinions shaken,\r\nand freedom, expelled from the laws, could find no refuge in the land;\r\nwhen nothing protected the citizens, and the citizens no longer\r\nprotected themselves; when human nature was the sport of man, and\r\nprinces wearied out the clemency of Heaven before they exhausted the\r\npatience of their subjects. Those who hope to revive the monarchy of\r\nHenry IV or of Louis XIV, appear to me to be afflicted with mental\r\nblindness; and when I consider the present condition of several\r\nEuropean nations\xe2\x80\x94a condition to which all the others tend\xe2\x80\x94I am led to\r\nbelieve that they will soon be left with no other alternative than\r\ndemocratic liberty, or the tyranny of the Caesars. *n\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ [This prediction of the return of France to imperial despotism, and\r\nof the true character of that despotic power, was written in 1832, and\r\nrealized to the letter in 1852.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether men are to be\r\nentirely emancipated or entirely enslaved; whether their rights are to\r\nbe made equal, or wholly taken away from them. If the rulers of society\r\nwere reduced either gradually to raise the crowd to their own level, or\r\nto sink the citizens below that of humanity, would not the doubts of\r\nmany be resolved, the consciences of many be healed, and the community\r\nprepared to make great sacrifices with little difficulty? In that case,\r\nthe gradual growth of democratic manners and institutions should be\r\nregarded, not as the best, but as the only means of preserving freedom;\r\nand without liking the government of democracy, it might be adopted as\r\nthe most applicable and the fairest remedy for the present ills of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to associate a people in the work of government; but it\r\nis still more difficult to supply it with experience, and to inspire it\r\nwith the feelings which it requires in order to govern well. I grant\r\nthat the caprices of democracy are perpetual; its instruments are rude;\r\nits laws imperfect. But if it were true that soon no just medium would\r\nexist between the empire of democracy and the dominion of a single arm,\r\nshould we not rather incline towards the former than submit voluntarily\r\nto the latter? And if complete equality be our fate, is it not better\r\nto be levelled by free institutions than by despotic power?\r\n\r\nThose who, after having read this book, should imagine that my\r\nintention in writing it has been to propose the laws and manners of the\r\nAnglo-Americans for the imitation of all democratic peoples, would\r\ncommit a very great mistake; they must have paid more attention to the\r\nform than to the substance of my ideas. My aim has been to show, by the\r\nexample of America, that laws, and especially manners, may exist which\r\nwill allow a democratic people to remain free. But I am very far from\r\nthinking that we ought to follow the example of the American democracy,\r\nand copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends; for I am\r\nwell aware of the influence which the nature of a country and its\r\npolitical precedents exercise upon a constitution; and I should regard\r\nit as a great misfortune for mankind if liberty were to exist all over\r\nthe world under the same forms.\r\n\r\nBut I am of opinion that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing\r\ndemocratic institutions into France, and if we despair of imparting to\r\nthe citizens those ideas and sentiments which first prepare them for\r\nfreedom, and afterwards allow them to enjoy it, there will be no\r\nindependence at all, either for the middling classes or the nobility,\r\nfor the poor or for the rich, but an equal tyranny over all; and I\r\nforesee that if the peaceable empire of the majority be not founded\r\namongst us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at the unlimited\r\nauthority of a single despot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United\r\n States\xe2\x80\x94Part I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Three Races Which\r\nInhabit The Territory Of The United States\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the task which I had imposed upon myself is now\r\nperformed. I have shown, as far as I was able, the laws and the manners\r\nof the American democracy. Here I might stop; but the reader would\r\nperhaps feel that I had not satisfied his expectations.\r\n\r\nThe absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we meet with in\r\nAmerica; the inhabitants of the New World may be considered from more\r\nthan one point of view. In the course of this work my subject has often\r\nled me to speak of the Indians and the Negroes; but I have never been\r\nable to stop in order to show what place these two races occupy in the\r\nmidst of the democratic people whom I was engaged in describing. I have\r\nmentioned in what spirit, and according to what laws, the\r\nAnglo-American Union was formed; but I could only glance at the dangers\r\nwhich menace that confederation, whilst it was equally impossible for\r\nme to give a detailed account of its chances of duration, independently\r\nof its laws and manners. When speaking of the united republican States,\r\nI hazarded no conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in\r\nthe New World, and when making frequent allusion to the commercial\r\nactivity which reigns in the Union, I was unable to inquire into the\r\nfuture condition of the Americans as a commercial people.\r\n\r\nThese topics are collaterally connected with my subject without forming\r\na part of it; they are American without being democratic; and to\r\nportray democracy has been my principal aim. It was therefore necessary\r\nto postpone these questions, which I now take up as the proper\r\ntermination of my work.\r\n\r\nThe territory now occupied or claimed by the American Union spreads\r\nfrom the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific Ocean. On the\r\neast and west its limits are those of the continent itself. On the\r\nsouth it advances nearly to the tropic, and it extends upwards to the\r\nicy regions of the North. The human beings who are scattered over this\r\nspace do not form, as in Europe, so many branches of the same stock.\r\nThree races, naturally distinct, and, I might almost say, hostile to\r\neach other, are discoverable amongst them at the first glance. Almost\r\ninsurmountable barriers had been raised between them by education and\r\nby law, as well as by their origin and outward characteristics; but\r\nfortune has brought them together on the same soil, where, although\r\nthey are mixed, they do not amalgamate, and each race fulfils its\r\ndestiny apart.\r\n\r\nAmongst these widely differing families of men, the first which\r\nattracts attention, the superior in intelligence, in power and in\r\nenjoyment, is the white or European, the man pre-eminent; and in\r\nsubordinate grades, the negro and the Indian. These two unhappy races\r\nhave nothing in common; neither birth, nor features, nor language, nor\r\nhabits. Their only resemblance lies in their misfortunes. Both of them\r\noccupy an inferior rank in the country they inhabit; both suffer from\r\ntyranny; and if their wrongs are not the same, they originate, at any\r\nrate, with the same authors.\r\n\r\nIf we reasoned from what passes in the world, we should almost say that\r\nthe European is to the other races of mankind, what man is to the lower\r\nanimals;\xe2\x80\x94he makes them subservient to his use; and when he cannot\r\nsubdue, he destroys them. Oppression has, at one stroke, deprived the\r\ndescendants of the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity.\r\nThe negro of the United States has lost all remembrance of his country;\r\nthe language which his forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he\r\nabjured their religion and forgot their customs when he ceased to\r\nbelong to Africa, without acquiring any claim to European privileges.\r\nBut he remains half way between the two communities; sold by the one,\r\nrepulsed by the other; finding not a spot in the universe to call by\r\nthe name of country, except the faint image of a home which the shelter\r\nof his master\xe2\x80\x99s roof affords.\r\n\r\nThe negro has no family; woman is merely the temporary companion of his\r\npleasures, and his children are upon an equality with himself from the\r\nmoment of their birth. Am I to call it a proof of God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy or a\r\nvisitation of his wrath, that man in certain states appears to be\r\ninsensible to his extreme wretchedness, and almost affects, with a\r\ndepraved taste, the cause of his misfortunes? The negro, who is plunged\r\nin this abyss of evils, scarcely feels his own calamitous situation.\r\nViolence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the\r\nthoughts and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants more than he\r\nhates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of\r\nthose who oppress him: his understanding is degraded to the level of\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\nThe negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born: nay, he may have\r\nbeen purchased in the womb, and have begun his slavery before he began\r\nhis existence. Equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to\r\nhimself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the\r\nproperty of another, who has an interest in preserving his life, and\r\nthat the care of it does not devolve upon himself; even the power of\r\nthought appears to him a useless gift of Providence, and he quietly\r\nenjoys the privileges of his debasement. If he becomes free,\r\nindependence is often felt by him to be a heavier burden than slavery;\r\nfor having learned, in the course of his life, to submit to everything\r\nexcept reason, he is too much unacquainted with her dictates to obey\r\nthem. A thousand new desires beset him, and he is destitute of the\r\nknowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which\r\nit is necessary to contend with, and he has learnt only to submit and\r\nobey. In short, he sinks to such a depth of wretchedness, that while\r\nservitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.\r\n\r\nOppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the negro race,\r\nbut its effects are different. Before the arrival of white men in the\r\nNew World, the inhabitants of North America lived quietly in their\r\nwoods, enduring the vicissitudes and practising the virtues and vices\r\ncommon to savage nations. The Europeans, having dispersed the Indian\r\ntribes and driven them into the deserts, condemned them to a wandering\r\nlife full of inexpressible sufferings.\r\n\r\nSavage nations are only controlled by opinion and by custom. When the\r\nNorth American Indians had lost the sentiment of attachment to their\r\ncountry; when their families were dispersed, their traditions obscured,\r\nand the chain of their recollections broken; when all their habits were\r\nchanged, and their wants increased beyond measure, European tyranny\r\nrendered them more disorderly and less civilized than they were before.\r\nThe moral and physical condition of these tribes continually grew\r\nworse, and they became more barbarous as they became more wretched.\r\nNevertheless, the Europeans have not been able to metamorphose the\r\ncharacter of the Indians; and though they have had power to destroy\r\nthem, they have never been able to make them submit to the rules of\r\ncivilized society.\r\n\r\nThe lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while\r\nthat of the Indian lies on the uttermost verge of liberty; and slavery\r\ndoes not produce more fatal effects upon the first, than independence\r\nupon the second. The negro has lost all property in his own person, and\r\nhe cannot dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud:\r\nbut the savage is his own master as soon as he is able to act; parental\r\nauthority is scarcely known to him; he has never bent his will to that\r\nof any of his kind, nor learned the difference between voluntary\r\nobedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of law is\r\nunknown to him. To be free, with him, signifies to escape from all the\r\nshackles of society. As he delights in this barbarous independence, and\r\nwould rather perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civilization\r\nhas little power over him.\r\n\r\nThe negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself\r\namongst men who repulse him; he conforms to the tastes of his\r\noppressors, adopts their opinions, and hopes by imitating them to form\r\na part of their community. Having been told from infancy that his race\r\nis naturally inferior to that of the whites, he assents to the\r\nproposition and is ashamed of his own nature. In each of his features\r\nhe discovers a trace of slavery, and, if it were in his power, he would\r\nwillingly rid himself of everything that makes him what he is.\r\n\r\nThe Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated with the\r\npretended nobility of his origin, and lives and dies in the midst of\r\nthese dreams of pride. Far from desiring to conform his habits to ours,\r\nhe loves his savage life as the distinguishing mark of his race, and he\r\nrepels every advance to civilization, less perhaps from the hatred\r\nwhich he entertains for it, than from a dread of resembling the\r\nEuropeans. *a While he has nothing to oppose to our perfection in the\r\narts but the resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing but\r\nundisciplined courage; whilst our well-digested plans are met by the\r\nspontaneous instincts of savage life, who can wonder if he fails in\r\nthis unequal contest?\r\n\r\na\r\n[ The native of North America retains his opinions and the most\r\ninsignificant of his habits with a degree of tenacity which has no\r\nparallel in history. For more than two hundred years the wandering\r\ntribes of North America have had daily intercourse with the whites, and\r\nthey have never derived from them either a custom or an idea. Yet the\r\nEuropeans have exercised a powerful influence over the savages: they\r\nhave made them more licentious, but not more European. In the summer of\r\n1831 I happened to be beyond Lake Michigan, at a place called Green\r\nBay, which serves as the extreme frontier between the United States and\r\nthe Indians on the north-western side. Here I became acquainted with an\r\nAmerican officer, Major H., who, after talking to me at length on the\r\ninflexibility of the Indian character, related the following fact:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nformerly knew a young Indian,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwho had been educated at a\r\ncollege in New England, where he had greatly distinguished himself, and\r\nhad acquired the external appearance of a member of civilized society.\r\nWhen the war broke out between ourselves and the English in 1810, I saw\r\nthis young man again; he was serving in our army, at the head of the\r\nwarriors of his tribe, for the Indians were admitted amongst the ranks\r\nof the Americans, upon condition that they would abstain from their\r\nhorrible custom of scalping their victims. On the evening of the battle\r\nof . . ., C. came and sat himself down by the fire of our bivouac. I\r\nasked him what had been his fortune that day: he related his exploits;\r\nand growing warm and animated by the recollection of them, he concluded\r\nby suddenly opening the breast of his coat, saying, \xe2\x80\x98You must not\r\nbetray me\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x99 And I actually beheld,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Major, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween\r\nhis body and his shirt, the skin and hair of an English head, still\r\ndripping with gore.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negro, who earnestly desires to mingle his race with that of the\r\nEuropean, cannot effect if; while the Indian, who might succeed to a\r\ncertain extent, disdains to make the attempt. The servility of the one\r\ndooms him to slavery, the pride of the other to death.\r\n\r\nI remember that while I was travelling through the forests which still\r\ncover the State of Alabama, I arrived one day at the log house of a\r\npioneer. I did not wish to penetrate into the dwelling of the American,\r\nbut retired to rest myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which\r\nwas not far off, in the woods. While I was in this place (which was in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Creek territory), an Indian woman appeared,\r\nfollowed by a negress, and holding by the hand a little white girl of\r\nfive or six years old, whom I took to be the daughter of the pioneer. A\r\nsort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the Indian; rings of\r\nmetal were hanging from her nostrils and ears; her hair, which was\r\nadorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders; and I saw\r\nthat she was not married, for she still wore that necklace of shells\r\nwhich the bride always deposits on the nuptial couch. The negress was\r\nclad in squalid European garments. They all three came and seated\r\nthemselves upon the banks of the fountain; and the young Indian, taking\r\nthe child in her arms, lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers\r\ngive; while the negress endeavored by various little artifices to\r\nattract the attention of the young Creole.\r\n\r\nThe child displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of\r\nsuperiority which formed a strange contrast with her infantine\r\nweakness; as if she received the attentions of her companions with a\r\nsort of condescension. The negress was seated on the ground before her\r\nmistress, watching her smallest desires, and apparently divided between\r\nstrong affection for the child and servile fear; whilst the savage\r\ndisplayed, in the midst of her tenderness, an air of freedom and of\r\npride which was almost ferocious. I had approached the group, and I\r\ncontemplated them in silence; but my curiosity was probably displeasing\r\nto the Indian woman, for she suddenly rose, pushed the child roughly\r\nfrom her, and giving me an angry look plunged into the thicket. I had\r\noften chanced to see individuals met together in the same place, who\r\nbelonged to the three races of men which people North America. I had\r\nperceived from many different results the preponderance of the whites.\r\nBut in the picture which I have just been describing there was\r\nsomething peculiarly touching; a bond of affection here united the\r\noppressors with the oppressed, and the effort of nature to bring them\r\ntogether rendered still more striking the immense distance placed\r\nbetween them by prejudice and by law.\r\n\r\nThe Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Indian Tribes Which\r\nInhabit The Territory Possessed By The Union\r\n\r\nGradual disappearance of the native tribes\xe2\x80\x94Manner in which it takes\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94Miseries accompanying the forced migrations of the Indians\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nsavages of North America had only two ways of escaping destruction; war\r\nor civilization\xe2\x80\x94They are no longer able to make war\xe2\x80\x94Reasons why they\r\nrefused to become civilized when it was in their power, and why they\r\ncannot become so now that they desire it\xe2\x80\x94Instance of the Creeks and\r\nCherokees\xe2\x80\x94Policy of the particular States towards these Indians\xe2\x80\x94Policy\r\nof the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nNone of the Indian tribes which formerly inhabited the territory of New\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94the Naragansetts, the Mohicans, the Pecots\xe2\x80\x94have any existence\r\nbut in the recollection of man. The Lenapes, who received William Penn,\r\na hundred and fifty years ago, upon the banks of the Delaware, have\r\ndisappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were\r\nbegging alms. The nations I have mentioned formerly covered the country\r\nto the sea-coast; but a traveller at the present day must penetrate\r\nmore than a hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to find\r\nan Indian. Not only have these wild tribes receded, but they are\r\ndestroyed; *b and as they give way or perish, an immense and increasing\r\npeople fills their place. There is no instance upon record of so\r\nprodigious a growth, or so rapid a destruction: the manner in which the\r\nlatter change takes place is not difficult to describe.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ In the thirteen original States there are only 6,273 Indians\r\nremaining. (See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 90.)\r\n[The decrease in now far greater, and is verging on extinction. See\r\npage 360 of this volume.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians were the sole inhabitants of the wilds from whence\r\nthey have since been expelled, their wants were few. Their arms were of\r\ntheir own manufacture, their only drink was the water of the brook, and\r\ntheir clothes consisted of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished\r\nthem with food.\r\n\r\nThe Europeans introduced amongst the savages of North America\r\nfire-arms, ardent spirits, and iron: they taught them to exchange for\r\nmanufactured stuffs, the rough garments which had previously satisfied\r\ntheir untutored simplicity. Having acquired new tastes, without the\r\narts by which they could be gratified, the Indians were obliged to have\r\nrecourse to the workmanship of the whites; but in return for their\r\nproductions the savage had nothing to offer except the rich furs which\r\nstill abounded in his woods. Hence the chase became necessary, not\r\nmerely to provide for his subsistence, but in order to procure the only\r\nobjects of barter which he could furnish to Europe. *c Whilst the wants\r\nof the natives were thus increasing, their resources continued to\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their Report to Congress on February 4,\r\n1829, p. 23, expressed themselves thus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe time when the Indians\r\ngenerally could supply themselves with food and clothing, without any\r\nof the articles of civilized life, has long since passed away. The more\r\nremote tribes, beyond the Mississippi, who live where immense herds of\r\nbuffalo are yet to be found and who follow those animals in their\r\nperiodical migrations, could more easily than any others recur to the\r\nhabits of their ancestors, and live without the white man or any of his\r\nmanufactures. But the buffalo is constantly receding. The smaller\r\nanimals, the bear, the deer, the beaver, the otter, the muskrat, etc.,\r\nprincipally minister to the comfort and support of the Indians; and\r\nthese cannot be taken without guns, ammunition, and traps. Among the\r\nNorthwestern Indians particularly, the labor of supplying a family with\r\nfood is excessive. Day after day is spent by the hunter without\r\nsuccess, and during this interval his family must subsist upon bark or\r\nroots, or perish. Want and misery are around them and among them. Many\r\ndie every winter from actual starvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians will not live as Europeans live, and yet they can neither\r\nsubsist without them, nor exactly after the fashion of their fathers.\r\nThis is demonstrated by a fact which I likewise give upon official\r\nauthority. Some Indians of a tribe on the banks of Lake Superior had\r\nkilled a European; the American government interdicted all traffic with\r\nthe tribe to which the guilty parties belonged, until they were\r\ndelivered up to justice. This measure had the desired effect.]\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when a European settlement is formed in the\r\nneighborhood of the territory occupied by the Indians, the beasts of\r\nchase take the alarm. *d Thousands of savages, wandering in the forests\r\nand destitute of any fixed dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon\r\nas the continuous sounds of European labor are heard in their\r\nneighborhood, they begin to flee away, and retire to the West, where\r\ntheir instinct teaches them that they will find deserts of immeasurable\r\nextent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe buffalo is constantly receding,\xe2\x80\x9d say Messrs. Clarke and\r\nCass in their Report of the year 1829; \xe2\x80\x9ca few years since they\r\napproached the base of the Alleghany; and a few years hence they may\r\neven be rare upon the immense plains which extend to the base of the\r\nRocky Mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d I have been assured that this effect of the approach\r\nof the whites is often felt at two hundred leagues\xe2\x80\x99 distance from their\r\nfrontier. Their influence is thus exerted over tribes whose name is\r\nunknown to them; and who suffer the evils of usurpation long before\r\nthey are acquainted with the authors of their distress. *e\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cFive years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d (says Volney in his \xe2\x80\x9cTableau des Etats-Unis,\xe2\x80\x9d p.\r\n370) \xe2\x80\x9cin going from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, a territory which now forms\r\npart of the State of Illinois, but which at the time I mention was\r\ncompletely wild (1797), you could not cross a prairie without seeing\r\nherds of from four to five hundred buffaloes. There are now none\r\nremaining; they swam across the Mississippi to escape from the hunters,\r\nand more particularly from the bells of the American cows.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ The truth of what I here advance may be easily proved by consulting\r\nthe tabular statement of Indian tribes inhabiting the United States and\r\ntheir territories. (Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, pp.\r\n90-105.) It is there shown that the tribes in the centre of America are\r\nrapidly decreasing, although the Europeans are still at a considerable\r\ndistance from them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBold adventurers soon penetrate into the country the Indians have\r\ndeserted, and when they have advanced about fifteen or twenty leagues\r\nfrom the extreme frontiers of the whites, they begin to build\r\nhabitations for civilized beings in the midst of the wilderness. This\r\nis done without difficulty, as the territory of a hunting-nation is\r\nill-defined; it is the common property of the tribe, and belongs to no\r\none in particular, so that individual interests are not concerned in\r\nthe protection of any part of it.\r\n\r\nA few European families, settled in different situations at a\r\nconsiderable distance from each other, soon drive away the wild animals\r\nwhich remain between their places of abode. The Indians, who had\r\npreviously lived in a sort of abundance, then find it difficult to\r\nsubsist, and still more difficult to procure the articles of barter\r\nwhich they stand in need of.\r\n\r\nTo drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence,\r\nas effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists were stricken\r\nwith barrenness; and they are reduced, like famished wolves, to prowl\r\nthrough the forsaken woods in quest of prey. Their instinctive love of\r\ntheir country attaches them to the soil which gave them birth, *f even\r\nafter it has ceased to yield anything but misery and death. At length\r\nthey are compelled to acquiesce, and to depart: they follow the traces\r\nof the elk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by these wild\r\nanimals in the choice of their future country. Properly speaking,\r\ntherefore, it is not the Europeans who drive away the native\r\ninhabitants of America; it is famine which compels them to recede; a\r\nhappy distinction which had escaped the casuists of former times, and\r\nfor which we are indebted to modern discovery!\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report to\r\nCongress, p. 15, \xe2\x80\x9care attached to their country by the same feelings\r\nwhich bind us to ours; and, besides, there are certain superstitious\r\nnotions connected with the alienation of what the Great Spirit gave to\r\ntheir ancestors, which operate strongly upon the tribes who have made\r\nfew or no cessions, but which are gradually weakened as our intercourse\r\nwith them is extended. \xe2\x80\x98We will not sell the spot which contains the\r\nbones of our fathers,\xe2\x80\x99 is almost always the first answer to a\r\nproposition for a sale.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive the extent of the sufferings which attend\r\nthese forced emigrations. They are undertaken by a people already\r\nexhausted and reduced; and the countries to which the newcomers betake\r\nthemselves are inhabited by other tribes which receive them with\r\njealous hostility. Hunger is in the rear; war awaits them, and misery\r\nbesets them on all sides. In the hope of escaping from such a host of\r\nenemies, they separate, and each individual endeavors to procure the\r\nmeans of supporting his existence in solitude and secrecy, living in\r\nthe immensity of the desert like an outcast in civilized society. The\r\nsocial tie, which distress had long since weakened, is then dissolved;\r\nthey have lost their country, and their people soon desert them: their\r\nvery families are obliterated; the names they bore in common are\r\nforgotten, their language perishes, and all traces of their origin\r\ndisappear. Their nation has ceased to exist, except in the recollection\r\nof the antiquaries of America and a few of the learned of Europe.\r\n\r\nI should be sorry to have my reader suppose that I am coloring the\r\npicture too highly; I saw with my own eyes several of the cases of\r\nmisery which I have been describing; and I was the witness of\r\nsufferings which I have not the power to portray.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1831, whilst I was on the left bank of the\r\nMississippi at a place named by Europeans, Memphis, there arrived a\r\nnumerous band of Choctaws (or Chactas, as they are called by the French\r\nin Louisiana). These savages had left their country, and were\r\nendeavoring to gain the right bank of the Mississippi, where they hoped\r\nto find an asylum which had been promised them by the American\r\ngovernment. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold was\r\nunusually severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the\r\nriver was drifting huge masses of ice. The Indians had their families\r\nwith them; and they brought in their train the wounded and sick, with\r\nchildren newly born, and old men upon the verge of death. They\r\npossessed neither tents nor wagons, but only their arms and some\r\nprovisions. I saw them embark to pass the mighty river, and never will\r\nthat solemn spectacle fade from my remembrance. No cry, no sob was\r\nheard amongst the assembled crowd; all were silent. Their calamities\r\nwere of ancient date, and they knew them to be irremediable. The\r\nIndians had all stepped into the bark which was to carry them across,\r\nbut their dogs remained upon the bank. As soon as these animals\r\nperceived that their masters were finally leaving the shore, they set\r\nup a dismal howl, and, plunging all together into the icy waters of the\r\nMississippi, they swam after the boat.\r\n\r\nThe ejectment of the Indians very often takes place at the present day,\r\nin a regular, and, as it were, a legal manner. When the European\r\npopulation begins to approach the limit of the desert inhabited by a\r\nsavage tribe, the government of the United States usually dispatches\r\nenvoys to them, who assemble the Indians in a large plain, and having\r\nfirst eaten and drunk with them, accost them in the following manner:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to do in the land of your fathers? Before long, you must\r\ndig up their bones in order to live. In what respect is the country you\r\ninhabit better than another? Are there no woods, marshes, or prairies,\r\nexcept where you dwell? And can you live nowhere but under your own\r\nsun? Beyond those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond the\r\nlake which bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast countries\r\nwhere beasts of chase are found in great abundance; sell your lands to\r\nus, and go to live happily in those solitudes.\xe2\x80\x9d After holding this\r\nlanguage, they spread before the eyes of the Indians firearms, woollen\r\ngarments, kegs of brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel,\r\nearrings, and looking-glasses. *g If, when they have beheld all these\r\nriches, they still hesitate, it is insinuated that they have not the\r\nmeans of refusing their required consent, and that the government\r\nitself will not long have the power of protecting them in their rights.\r\nWhat are they to do? Half convinced, and half compelled, they go to\r\ninhabit new deserts, where the importunate whites will not let them\r\nremain ten years in tranquillity. In this manner do the Americans\r\nobtain, at a very low price, whole provinces, which the richest\r\nsovereigns of Europe could not purchase. *h\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ See, in the Legislative Documents of Congress (Doc. 117), the\r\nnarrative of what takes place on these occasions. This curious passage\r\nis from the above-mentioned report, made to Congress by Messrs. Clarke\r\nand Cass in February, 1829. Mr. Cass is now the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d says the report, \xe2\x80\x9creach the treaty-ground poor and\r\nalmost naked. Large quantities of goods are taken there by the traders,\r\nand are seen and examined by the Indians. The women and children become\r\nimportunate to have their wants supplied, and their influence is soon\r\nexerted to induce a sale. Their improvidence is habitual and\r\nunconquerable. The gratification of his immediate wants and desires is\r\nthe ruling passion of an Indian. The expectation of future advantages\r\nseldom produces much effect. The experience of the past is lost, and\r\nthe prospects of the future disregarded. It would be utterly hopeless\r\nto demand a cession of land, unless the means were at hand of\r\ngratifying their immediate wants; and when their condition and\r\ncircumstances are fairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that\r\nthey are so anxious to relieve themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ On May 19, 1830, Mr. Edward Everett affirmed before the House of\r\nRepresentatives, that the Americans had already acquired by treaty, to\r\nthe east and west of the Mississippi, 230,000,000 of acres. In 1808 the\r\nOsages gave up 48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of $1,000. In\r\n1818 the Quapaws yielded up 29,000,000 acres for $4,000. They reserved\r\nfor themselves a territory of 1,000,000 acres for a hunting-ground. A\r\nsolemn oath was taken that it should be respected: but before long it\r\nwas invaded like the rest. Mr. Bell, in his Report of the Committee on\r\nIndian Affairs, February 24, 1830, has these words:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo pay an Indian\r\ntribe what their ancient hunting-grounds are worth to them, after the\r\ngame is fled or destroyed, as a mode of appropriating wild lands\r\nclaimed by Indians, has been found more convenient, and certainly it is\r\nmore agreeable to the forms of justice, as well as more merciful, than\r\nto assert the possession of them by the sword. Thus the practice of\r\nbuying Indian titles is but the substitute which humanity and\r\nexpediency have imposed, in place of the sword, in arriving at the\r\nactual enjoyment of property claimed by the right of discovery, and\r\nsanctioned by the natural superiority allowed to the claims of\r\ncivilized communities over those of savage tribes. Up to the present\r\ntime so invariable has been the operation of certain causes, first in\r\ndiminishing the value of forest lands to the Indians, and secondly in\r\ndisposing them to sell readily, that the plan of buying their right of\r\noccupancy has never threatened to retard, in any perceptible degree,\r\nthe prosperity of any of the States.\xe2\x80\x9d (Legislative Documents, 21st\r\nCongress, No. 227, p. 6.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part II\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are great evils; and it must be added that they appear to me to\r\nbe irremediable. I believe that the Indian nations of North America are\r\ndoomed to perish; and that whenever the Europeans shall be established\r\non the shores of the Pacific Ocean, that race of men will be no more.\r\n*i The Indians had only the two alternatives of war or civilization; in\r\nother words, they must either have destroyed the Europeans or become\r\ntheir equals.\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of almost all American\r\nstatesmen. \xe2\x80\x9cJudging of the future by the past,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Cass, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\ncannot err in anticipating a progressive diminution of their numbers,\r\nand their eventual extinction, unless our border should become\r\nstationary, and they be removed beyond it, or unless some radical\r\nchange should take place in the principles of our intercourse with\r\nthem, which it is easier to hope for than to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the first settlement of the colonies they might have found it\r\npossible, by uniting their forces, to deliver themselves from the small\r\nbodies of strangers who landed on their continent. *j They several\r\ntimes attempted to do it, and were on the point of succeeding; but the\r\ndisproportion of their resources, at the present day, when compared\r\nwith those of the whites, is too great to allow such an enterprise to\r\nbe thought of. Nevertheless, there do arise from time to time among the\r\nIndians men of penetration, who foresee the final destiny which awaits\r\nthe native population, and who exert themselves to unite all the tribes\r\nin common hostility to the Europeans; but their efforts are unavailing.\r\nThose tribes which are in the neighborhood of the whites, are too much\r\nweakened to offer an effectual resistance; whilst the others, giving\r\nway to that childish carelessness of the morrow which characterizes\r\nsavage life, wait for the near approach of danger before they prepare\r\nto meet it; some are unable, the others are unwilling, to exert\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ Amongst other warlike enterprises, there was one of the Wampanaogs,\r\nand other confederate tribes, under Metacom in 1675, against the\r\ncolonists of New England; the English were also engaged in war in\r\nVirginia in 1622.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to foresee that the Indians will never conform to\r\ncivilization; or that it will be too late, whenever they may be\r\ninclined to make the experiment.\r\n\r\nCivilization is the result of a long social process which takes place\r\nin the same spot, and is handed down from one generation to another,\r\neach one profiting by the experience of the last. Of all nations, those\r\nsubmit to civilization with the most difficulty which habitually live\r\nby the chase. Pastoral tribes, indeed, often change their place of\r\nabode; but they follow a regular order in their migrations, and often\r\nreturn again to their old stations, whilst the dwelling of the hunter\r\nvaries with that of the animals he pursues.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to diffuse knowledge amongst the\r\nIndians, without controlling their wandering propensities; by the\r\nJesuits in Canada, and by the Puritans in New England; *k but none of\r\nthese endeavors were crowned by any lasting success. Civilization began\r\nin the cabin, but it soon retired to expire in the woods. The great\r\nerror of these legislators of the Indians was their not understanding\r\nthat, in order to succeed in civilizing a people, it is first necessary\r\nto fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to cultivate the\r\nsoil; the Indians ought in the first place to have been accustomed to\r\nagriculture. But not only are they destitute of this indispensable\r\npreliminary to civilization, they would even have great difficulty in\r\nacquiring it. Men who have once abandoned themselves to the restless\r\nand adventurous life of the hunter, feel an insurmountable disgust for\r\nthe constant and regular labor which tillage requires. We see this\r\nproved in the bosom of our own society; but it is far more visible\r\namong peoples whose partiality for the chase is a part of their\r\nnational character.\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ See the \xe2\x80\x9cHistoire de la Nouvelle France,\xe2\x80\x9d by Charlevoix, and the work\r\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cLettres edifiantes.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependently of this general difficulty, there is another, which\r\napplies peculiarly to the Indians; they consider labor not merely as an\r\nevil, but as a disgrace; so that their pride prevents them from\r\nbecoming civilized, as much as their indolence. *l\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cIn all the tribes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Volney, in his \xe2\x80\x9cTableau des Etats-Unis,\xe2\x80\x9d p.\r\n423, \xe2\x80\x9cthere still exists a generation of old warriors, who cannot\r\nforbear, when they see their countrymen using the hoe, from exclaiming\r\nagainst the degradation of ancient manners, and asserting that the\r\nsavages owe their decline to these innovations; adding, that they have\r\nonly to return to their primitive habits in order to recover their\r\npower and their glory.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no Indian so wretched as not to retain under his hut of bark a\r\nlofty idea of his personal worth; he considers the cares of industry\r\nand labor as degrading occupations; he compares the husbandman to the\r\nox which traces the furrow; and even in our most ingenious handicraft,\r\nhe can see nothing but the labor of slaves. Not that he is devoid of\r\nadmiration for the power and intellectual greatness of the whites; but\r\nalthough the result of our efforts surprises him, he contemns the means\r\nby which we obtain it; and while he acknowledges our ascendancy, he\r\nstill believes in his superiority. War and hunting are the only\r\npursuits which appear to him worthy to be the occupations of a man. *m\r\nThe Indian, in the dreary solitude of his woods, cherishes the same\r\nideas, the same opinions as the noble of the Middle ages in his castle,\r\nand he only requires to become a conqueror to complete the resemblance;\r\nthus, however strange it may seem, it is in the forests of the New\r\nWorld, and not amongst the Europeans who people its coasts, that the\r\nancient prejudices of Europe are still in existence.\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ The following description occurs in an official document: \xe2\x80\x9cUntil a\r\nyoung man has been engaged with an enemy, and has performed some acts\r\nof valor, he gains no consideration, but is regarded nearly as a woman.\r\nIn their great war-dances all the warriors in succession strike the\r\npost, as it is called, and recount their exploits. On these occasions\r\ntheir auditory consists of the kinsmen, friends, and comrades of the\r\nnarrator. The profound impression which his discourse produces on them\r\nis manifested by the silent attention it receives, and by the loud\r\nshouts which hail its termination. The young man who finds himself at\r\nsuch a meeting without anything to recount is very unhappy; and\r\ninstances have sometimes occurred of young warriors, whose passions had\r\nbeen thus inflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and going off\r\nalone to seek for trophies which they might exhibit, and adventures\r\nwhich they might be allowed to relate.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than once, in the course of this work, I have endeavored to\r\nexplain the prodigious influence which the social condition appears to\r\nexercise upon the laws and the manners of men; and I beg to add a few\r\nwords on the same subject.\r\n\r\nWhen I perceive the resemblance which exists between the political\r\ninstitutions of our ancestors, the Germans, and of the wandering tribes\r\nof North America; between the customs described by Tacitus, and those\r\nof which I have sometimes been a witness, I cannot help thinking that\r\nthe same cause has brought about the same results in both hemispheres;\r\nand that in the midst of the apparent diversity of human affairs, a\r\ncertain number of primary facts may be discovered, from which all the\r\nothers are derived. In what we usually call the German institutions,\r\nthen, I am inclined only to perceive barbarian habits; and the opinions\r\nof savages in what we style feudal principles.\r\n\r\nHowever strongly the vices and prejudices of the North American Indians\r\nmay be opposed to their becoming agricultural and civilized, necessity\r\nsometimes obliges them to it. Several of the Southern nations, and\r\namongst others the Cherokees and the Creeks, *n were surrounded by\r\nEuropeans, who had landed on the shores of the Atlantic; and who,\r\neither descending the Ohio or proceeding up the Mississippi, arrived\r\nsimultaneously upon their borders. These tribes have not been driven\r\nfrom place to place, like their Northern brethren; but they have been\r\ngradually enclosed within narrow limits, like the game within the\r\nthicket, before the huntsmen plunge into the interior. The Indians who\r\nwere thus placed between civilization and death, found themselves\r\nobliged to live by ignominious labor like the whites. They took to\r\nagriculture, and without entirely forsaking their old habits or\r\nmanners, sacrificed only as much as was necessary to their existence.\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ These nations are now swallowed up in the States of Georgia,\r\nTennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. There were formerly in the South\r\nfour great nations (remnants of which still exist), the Choctaws, the\r\nChickasaws, the Creeks, and the Cherokees. The remnants of these four\r\nnations amounted, in 1830, to about 75,000 individuals. It is computed\r\nthat there are now remaining in the territory occupied or claimed by\r\nthe Anglo-American Union about 300,000 Indians. (See Proceedings of the\r\nIndian Board in the City of New York.) The official documents supplied\r\nto Congress make the number amount to 313,130. The reader who is\r\ncurious to know the names and numerical strength of all the tribes\r\nwhich inhabit the Anglo-American territory should consult the documents\r\nI refer to. (Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, pp.\r\n90-105.) [In the Census of 1870 it is stated that the Indian population\r\nof the United States is only 25,731, of whom 7,241 are in California.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees went further; they created a written language;\r\nestablished a permanent form of government; and as everything proceeds\r\nrapidly in the New World, before they had all of them clothes, they set\r\nup a newspaper. *o\r\n\r\no\r\n[ I brought back with me to France one or two copies of this singular\r\npublication.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth of European habits has been remarkably accelerated among\r\nthese Indians by the mixed race which has sprung up. *p Deriving\r\nintelligence from their father\xe2\x80\x99s side, without entirely losing the\r\nsavage customs of the mother, the half-blood forms the natural link\r\nbetween civilization and barbarism. Wherever this race has multiplied\r\nthe savage state has become modified, and a great change has taken\r\nplace in the manners of the people. *q\r\n\r\np\r\n[ See in the Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, 21st Congress,\r\nNo. 227, p. 23, the reasons for the multiplication of Indians of mixed\r\nblood among the Cherokees. The principal cause dates from the War of\r\nIndependence. Many Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having taken the side of\r\nEngland, were obliged to retreat among the Indians, where they\r\nmarried.]\r\n\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less influential\r\nin North America than in any other country. The American continent was\r\npeopled by two great nations of Europe, the French and the English. The\r\nformer were not slow in connecting themselves with the daughters of the\r\nnatives, but there was an unfortunate affinity between the Indian\r\ncharacter and their own: instead of giving the tastes and habits of\r\ncivilized life to the savages, the French too often grew passionately\r\nfond of the state of wild freedom they found them in. They became the\r\nmost dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the friendship\r\nof the Indian by exaggerating his vices and his virtues. M. de\r\nSenonville, the governor of Canada, wrote thus to Louis XIV in 1685:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages we\r\nought to draw them nearer to us. But there is every reason to suppose\r\nwe have been mistaken. Those which have been brought into contact with\r\nus have not become French, and the French who have lived among them are\r\nchanged into savages, affecting to dress and live like them.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cHistory\r\nof New France,\xe2\x80\x9d by Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The Englishman, on\r\nthe contrary, continuing obstinately attached to the customs and the\r\nmost insignificant habits of his forefathers, has remained in the midst\r\nof the American solitudes just what he was in the bosom of European\r\ncities; he would not allow of any communication with savages whom he\r\ndespised, and avoided with care the union of his race with theirs. Thus\r\nwhile the French exercised no salutary influence over the Indians, the\r\nEnglish have always remained alien from them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are capable of\r\ncivilization, but it does not prove that they will succeed in it. This\r\ndifficulty which the Indians find in submitting to civilization\r\nproceeds from the influence of a general cause, which it is almost\r\nimpossible for them to escape. An attentive survey of history\r\ndemonstrates that, in general, barbarous nations have raised themselves\r\nto civilization by degrees, and by their own efforts. Whenever they\r\nderive knowledge from a foreign people, they stood towards it in the\r\nrelation of conquerors, and not of a conquered nation. When the\r\nconquered nation is enlightened, and the conquerors are half savage, as\r\nin the case of the invasion of Rome by the Northern nations or that of\r\nChina by the Mongols, the power which victory bestows upon the\r\nbarbarian is sufficient to keep up his importance among civilized men,\r\nand permit him to rank as their equal, until he becomes their rival:\r\nthe one has might on his side, the other has intelligence; the former\r\nadmires the knowledge and the arts of the conquered, the latter envies\r\nthe power of the conquerors. The barbarians at length admit civilized\r\nman into their palaces, and he in turn opens his schools to the\r\nbarbarians. But when the side on which the physical force lies, also\r\npossesses an intellectual preponderance, the conquered party seldom\r\nbecome civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. It may therefore be\r\nsaid, in a general way, that savages go forth in arms to seek\r\nknowledge, but that they do not receive it when it comes to them.\r\n\r\nIf the Indian tribes which now inhabit the heart of the continent could\r\nsummon up energy enough to attempt to civilize themselves, they might\r\npossibly succeed. Superior already to the barbarous nations which\r\nsurround them, they would gradually gain strength and experience, and\r\nwhen the Europeans should appear upon their borders, they would be in a\r\nstate, if not to maintain their independence, at least to assert their\r\nright to the soil, and to incorporate themselves with the conquerors.\r\nBut it is the misfortune of Indians to be brought into contact with a\r\ncivilized people, which is also (it must be owned) the most avaricious\r\nnation on the globe, whilst they are still semi-barbarian: to find\r\ndespots in their instructors, and to receive knowledge from the hand of\r\noppression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North American\r\nIndian was destitute, but he had no feeling of inferiority towards\r\nanyone; as soon, however, as he desires to penetrate into the social\r\nscale of the whites, he takes the lowest rank in society, for he\r\nenters, ignorant and poor, within the pale of science and wealth. After\r\nhaving led a life of agitation, beset with evils and dangers, but at\r\nthe same time filled with proud emotions, *r he is obliged to submit to\r\na wearisome, obscure, and degraded state; and to gain the bread which\r\nnourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his eyes the only\r\nresults of which civilization can boast: and even this much he is not\r\nsure to obtain.\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain irresistible\r\ncharm, which seizes the heart of man and carries him away in spite of\r\nreason and experience. This is plainly shown by the memoirs of Tanner.\r\nTanner is a European who was carried away at the age of six by the\r\nIndians, and has remained thirty years with them in the woods. Nothing\r\ncan be conceived more appalling that the miseries which he describes.\r\nHe tells us of tribes without a chief, families without a nation to\r\ncall their own, men in a state of isolation, wrecks of powerful tribes\r\nwandering at random amid the ice and snow and desolate solitudes of\r\nCanada. Hunger and cold pursue them; every day their life is in\r\njeopardy. Amongst these men, manners have lost their empire, traditions\r\nare without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner shared in\r\nall these miseries; he was aware of his European origin; he was not\r\nkept away from the whites by force; on the contrary, he came every year\r\nto trade with them, entered their dwellings, and witnessed their\r\nenjoyments; he knew that whenever he chose to return to civilized life\r\nhe was perfectly able to do so\xe2\x80\x94and he remained thirty years in the\r\ndeserts. When he came into civilized society he declared that the rude\r\nexistence which he described, had a secret charm for him which he was\r\nunable to define: he returned to it again and again: at length he\r\nabandoned it with poignant regret; and when he was at length fixed\r\namong the whites, several of his children refused to share his tranquil\r\nand easy situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake\r\nSuperior; he seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civilized\r\nbeing. His book is written without either taste or order; but he gives,\r\neven unconsciously, a lively picture of the prejudices, the passions,\r\nthe vices, and, above all, of the destitution in which he lived.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians undertake to imitate their European neighbors, and to\r\ntill the earth like the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a\r\nvery formidable competition. The white man is skilled in the craft of\r\nagriculture; the Indian is a rough beginner in an art with which he is\r\nunacquainted. The former reaps abundant crops without difficulty, the\r\nlatter meets with a thousand obstacles in raising the fruits of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe European is placed amongst a population whose wants he knows and\r\npartakes. The savage is isolated in the midst of a hostile people, with\r\nwhose manners, language, and laws he is imperfectly acquainted, but\r\nwithout whose assistance he cannot live. He can only procure the\r\nmaterials of comfort by bartering his commodities against the goods of\r\nthe European, for the assistance of his countrymen is wholly\r\ninsufficient to supply his wants. When the Indian wishes to sell the\r\nproduce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser, whilst\r\nthe European readily finds a market; and the former can only produce at\r\na considerable cost that which the latter vends at a very low rate.\r\nThus the Indian has no sooner escaped those evils to which barbarous\r\nnations are exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries\r\nof civilized communities; and he finds is scarcely less difficult to\r\nlive in the midst of our abundance, than in the depth of his own\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nHe has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the traditions of\r\nhis fathers and his passion for the chase are still alive within him.\r\nThe wild enjoyments which formerly animated him in the woods, painfully\r\nexcite his troubled imagination; and his former privations appear to be\r\nless keen, his former perils less appalling. He contrasts the\r\nindependence which he possessed amongst his equals with the servile\r\nposition which he occupies in civilized society. On the other hand, the\r\nsolitudes which were so long his free home are still at hand; a few\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 march will bring him back to them once more. The whites offer\r\nhim a sum, which seems to him to be considerable, for the ground which\r\nhe has begun to clear. This money of the Europeans may possibly furnish\r\nhim with the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remoter\r\nregions; and he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns\r\nto the wilderness forever. *s The condition of the Creeks and\r\nCherokees, to which I have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates\r\nthe truth of this deplorable picture.\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ The destructive influence of highly civilized nations upon others\r\nwhich are less so, has been exemplified by the Europeans themselves.\r\nAbout a century ago the French founded the town of Vincennes up on the\r\nWabash, in the middle of the desert; and they lived there in great\r\nplenty until the arrival of the American settlers, who first ruined the\r\nprevious inhabitants by their competition, and afterwards purchased\r\ntheir lands at a very low rate. At the time when M. de Volney, from\r\nwhom I borrow these details, passed through Vincennes, the number of\r\nthe French was reduced to a hundred individuals, most of whom were\r\nabout to pass over to Louisiana or to Canada. These French settlers\r\nwere worthy people, but idle and uninstructed: they had contracted many\r\nof the habits of savages. The Americans, who were perhaps their\r\ninferiors, in a moral point of view, were immeasurably superior to them\r\nin intelligence: they were industrious, well informed, rich, and\r\naccustomed to govern their own community.\r\n\r\n\r\nI myself saw in Canada, where the intellectual difference between the\r\ntwo races is less striking, that the English are the masters of\r\ncommerce and manufacture in the Canadian country, that they spread on\r\nall sides, and confine the French within limits which scarcely suffice\r\nto contain them. In like manner, in Louisiana, almost all activity in\r\ncommerce and manufacture centres in the hands of the Anglo-Americans.\r\n\r\nBut the case of Texas is still more striking: the State of Texas is a\r\npart of Mexico, and lies upon the frontier between that country and the\r\nUnited States. In the course of the last few years the Anglo-Americans\r\nhave penetrated into this province, which is still thinly peopled; they\r\npurchase land, they produce the commodities of the country, and\r\nsupplant the original population. It may easily be foreseen that if\r\nMexico takes no steps to check this change, the province of Texas will\r\nvery shortly cease to belong to that government.\r\n\r\nIf the different degrees\xe2\x80\x94comparatively so slight\xe2\x80\x94which exist in\r\nEuropean civilization produce results of such magnitude, the\r\nconsequences which must ensue from the collision of the most perfect\r\nEuropean civilization with Indian savages may readily be conceived.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians, in the little which they have done, have unquestionably\r\ndisplayed as much natural genius as the peoples of Europe in their most\r\nimportant designs; but nations as well as men require time to learn,\r\nwhatever may be their intelligence and their zeal. Whilst the savages\r\nwere engaged in the work of civilization, the Europeans continued to\r\nsurround them on every side, and to confine them within narrower\r\nlimits; the two races gradually met, and they are now in immediate\r\njuxtaposition to each other. The Indian is already superior to his\r\nbarbarous parent, but he is still very far below his white neighbor.\r\nWith their resources and acquired knowledge, the Europeans soon\r\nappropriated to themselves most of the advantages which the natives\r\nmight have derived from the possession of the soil; they have settled\r\nin the country, they have purchased land at a very low rate or have\r\noccupied it by force, and the Indians have been ruined by a competition\r\nwhich they had not the means of resisting. They were isolated in their\r\nown country, and their race only constituted a colony of troublesome\r\naliens in the midst of a numerous and domineering people. *t\r\n\r\nt\r\n[ See in the Legislative Documents (21st Congress, No. 89) instances of\r\nexcesses of every kind committed by the whites upon the territory of\r\nthe Indians, either in taking possession of a part of their lands,\r\nuntil compelled to retire by the troops of Congress, or carrying off\r\ntheir cattle, burning their houses, cutting down their corn, and doing\r\nviolence to their persons. It appears, nevertheless, from all these\r\ndocuments that the claims of the natives are constantly protected by\r\nthe government from the abuse of force. The Union has a representative\r\nagent continually employed to reside among the Indians; and the report\r\nof the Cherokee agent, which is among the documents I have referred to,\r\nis almost always favorable to the Indians. \xe2\x80\x9cThe intrusion of whites,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe says, \xe2\x80\x9cupon the lands of the Cherokees would cause ruin to the poor,\r\nhelpless, and inoffensive inhabitants.\xe2\x80\x9d And he further remarks upon the\r\nattempt of the State of Georgia to establish a division line for the\r\npurpose of limiting the boundaries of the Cherokees, that the line\r\ndrawn having been made by the whites, and entirely upon ex parte\r\nevidence of their several rights, was of no validity whatever.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington said in one of his messages to Congress, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are more\r\nenlightened and more powerful than the Indian nations, we are therefore\r\nbound in honor to treat them with kindness and even with generosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut this virtuous and high-minded policy has not been followed. The\r\nrapacity of the settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the\r\ngovernment. Although the Cherokees and the Creeks are established upon\r\nthe territory which they inhabited before the settlement of the\r\nEuropeans, and although the Americans have frequently treated with them\r\nas with foreign nations, the surrounding States have not consented to\r\nacknowledge them as independent peoples, and attempts have been made to\r\nsubject these children of the woods to Anglo-American magistrates,\r\nlaws, and customs. *u Destitution had driven these unfortunate Indians\r\nto civilization, and oppression now drives them back to their former\r\ncondition: many of them abandon the soil which they had begun to clear,\r\nand return to their savage course of life.\r\n\r\nu\r\n[ In 1829 the State of Alabama divided the Creek territory into\r\ncounties, and subjected the Indian population to the power of European\r\nmagistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the State of Mississippi assimilated the Choctaws and\r\nChickasaws to the white population, and declared that any of them that\r\nshould take the title of chief would be punished by a fine of $1,000\r\nand a year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment. When these laws were enforced upon the\r\nChoctaws, who inhabited that district, the tribe assembled, their chief\r\ncommunicated to them the intentions of the whites, and read to them\r\nsome of the laws to which it was intended that they should submit; and\r\nthey unanimously declared that it was better at once to retreat again\r\ninto the wilds.]\r\n\r\nIf we consider the tyrannical measures which have been adopted by the\r\nlegislatures of the Southern States, the conduct of their Governors,\r\nand the decrees of their courts of justice, we shall be convinced that\r\nthe entire expulsion of the Indians is the final result to which the\r\nefforts of their policy are directed. The Americans of that part of the\r\nUnion look with jealousy upon the aborigines, *v they are aware that\r\nthese tribes have not yet lost the traditions of savage life, and\r\nbefore civilization has permanently fixed them to the soil, it is\r\nintended to force them to recede by reducing them to despair. The\r\nCreeks and Cherokees, oppressed by the several States, have appealed to\r\nthe central government, which is by no means insensible to their\r\nmisfortunes, and is sincerely desirous of saving the remnant of the\r\nnatives, and of maintaining them in the free possession of that\r\nterritory, which the Union is pledged to respect. *w But the several\r\nStates oppose so formidable a resistance to the execution of this\r\ndesign, that the government is obliged to consent to the extirpation of\r\na few barbarous tribes in order not to endanger the safety of the\r\nAmerican Union.\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ The Georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proximity of the\r\nIndians, inhabit a territory which does not at present contain more\r\nthan seven inhabitants to the square mile. In France there are one\r\nhundred and sixty-two inhabitants to the same extent of country.]\r\n\r\n\r\nw\r\n[ In 1818 Congress appointed commissioners to visit the Arkansas\r\nTerritory, accompanied by a deputation of Creeks, Choctaws, and\r\nChickasaws. This expedition was commanded by Messrs. Kennerly, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy,\r\nWash Hood, and John Bell. See the different reports of the\r\ncommissioners, and their journal, in the Documents of Congress, No. 87,\r\nHouse of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the federal government, which is not able to protect the Indians,\r\nwould fain mitigate the hardships of their lot; and, with this\r\nintention, proposals have been made to transport them into more remote\r\nregions at the public cost.\r\n\r\nBetween the thirty-third and thirty-seventh degrees of north latitude,\r\na vast tract of country lies, which has taken the name of Arkansas,\r\nfrom the principal river that waters its extent. It is bounded on the\r\none side by the confines of Mexico, on the other by the Mississippi.\r\nNumberless streams cross it in every direction; the climate is mild,\r\nand the soil productive, but it is only inhabited by a few wandering\r\nhordes of savages. The government of the Union wishes to transport the\r\nbroken remnants of the indigenous population of the South to the\r\nportion of this country which is nearest to Mexico, and at a great\r\ndistance from the American settlements.\r\n\r\nWe were assured, towards the end of the year 1831, that 10,000 Indians\r\nhad already gone down to the shores of the Arkansas; and fresh\r\ndetachments were constantly following them; but Congress has been\r\nunable to excite a unanimous determination in those whom it is disposed\r\nto protect. Some, indeed, are willing to quit the seat of oppression,\r\nbut the most enlightened members of the community refuse to abandon\r\ntheir recent dwellings and their springing crops; they are of opinion\r\nthat the work of civilization, once interrupted, will never be resumed;\r\nthey fear that those domestic habits which have been so recently\r\ncontracted, may be irrevocably lost in the midst of a country which is\r\nstill barbarous, and where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of\r\nan agricultural people; they know that their entrance into those wilds\r\nwill be opposed by inimical hordes, and that they have lost the energy\r\nof barbarians, without acquiring the resources of civilization to\r\nresist their attacks. Moreover, the Indians readily discover that the\r\nsettlement which is proposed to them is merely a temporary expedient.\r\nWho can assure them that they will at length be allowed to dwell in\r\npeace in their new retreat? The United States pledge themselves to the\r\nobservance of the obligation; but the territory which they at present\r\noccupy was formerly secured to them by the most solemn oaths of\r\nAnglo-American faith. *x The American government does not indeed rob\r\nthem of their lands, but it allows perpetual incursions to be made on\r\nthem. In a few years the same white population which now flocks around\r\nthem, will track them to the solitudes of the Arkansas; they will then\r\nbe exposed to the same evils without the same remedies, and as the\r\nlimits of the earth will at last fail them, their only refuge is the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nx\r\n[ The fifth article of the treaty made with the Creeks in August, 1790,\r\nis in the following words:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States solemnly guarantee to the\r\nCreek nation all their land within the limits of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with the Cherokees\r\nsays:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States solemnly guarantee to the Cherokee nation all\r\ntheir lands not hereby ceded.\xe2\x80\x9d The following article declared that if\r\nany citizen of the United States or other settler not of the Indian\r\nrace should establish himself upon the territory of the Cherokees, the\r\nUnited States would withdraw their protection from that individual, and\r\ngive him up to be punished as the Cherokee nation should think fit.]\r\n\r\nThe Union treats the Indians with less cupidity and rigor than the\r\npolicy of the several States, but the two governments are alike\r\ndestitute of good faith. The States extend what they are pleased to\r\nterm the benefits of their laws to the Indians, with a belief that the\r\ntribes will recede rather than submit; and the central government,\r\nwhich promises a permanent refuge to these unhappy beings is well aware\r\nof its inability to secure it to them. *y\r\n\r\ny\r\n[ This does not prevent them from promising in the most solemn manner\r\nto do so. See the letter of the President addressed to the Creek\r\nIndians, March 23, 1829 (Proceedings of the Indian Board, in the city\r\nof New York, p. 5): \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond the great river Mississippi, where a part\r\nof your nation has gone, your father has provided a country large\r\nenough for all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your\r\nwhite brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the\r\nland, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as\r\nthe grass grows, or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be\r\nyours forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War, in a letter written to the Cherokees, April 18,\r\n1829, (see the same work, p. 6), declares to them that they cannot\r\nexpect to retain possession of the lands at that time occupied by them,\r\nbut gives them the most positive assurance of uninterrupted peace if\r\nthey would remove beyond the Mississippi: as if the power which could\r\nnot grant them protection then, would be able to afford it them\r\nhereafter!]\r\n\r\nThus the tyranny of the States obliges the savages to retire, the\r\nUnion, by its promises and resources, facilitates their retreat; and\r\nthese measures tend to precisely the same end. *z \xe2\x80\x9cBy the will of our\r\nFather in Heaven, the Governor of the whole world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cherokees\r\nin their petition to Congress, *a \xe2\x80\x9cthe red man of America has become\r\nsmall, and the white man great and renowned. When the ancestors of the\r\npeople of these United States first came to the shores of America they\r\nfound the red man strong: though he was ignorant and savage, yet he\r\nreceived them kindly, and gave them dry land to rest their weary feet.\r\nThey met in peace, and shook hands in token of friendship. Whatever the\r\nwhite man wanted and asked of the Indian, the latter willingly gave. At\r\nthat time the Indian was the lord, and the white man the suppliant. But\r\nnow the scene has changed. The strength of the red man has become\r\nweakness. As his neighbors increased in numbers his power became less\r\nand less, and now, of the many and powerful tribes who once covered\r\nthese United States, only a few are to be seen\xe2\x80\x94a few whom a sweeping\r\npestilence has left. The northern tribes, who were once so numerous and\r\npowerful, are now nearly extinct. Thus it has happened to the red man\r\nof America. Shall we, who are remnants, share the same fate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nz\r\n[ To obtain a correct idea of the policy pursued by the several States\r\nand the Union with respect to the Indians, it is necessary to consult,\r\n1st, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Laws of the Colonial and State Governments relating to the\r\nIndian Inhabitants.\xe2\x80\x9d (See the Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, No.\r\n319.) 2d, The Laws of the Union on the same subject, and especially\r\nthat of March 30, 1802. (See Story\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLaws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d) 3d,\r\nThe Report of Mr. Cass, Secretary of War, relative to Indian Affairs,\r\nNovember 29, 1823.]\r\n\r\n\r\na\r\n[ December 18, 1829.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe land on which we stand we have received as an inheritance from our\r\nfathers, who possessed it from time immemorial, as a gift from our\r\ncommon Father in Heaven. They bequeathed it to us as their children,\r\nand we have sacredly kept it, as containing the remains of our beloved\r\nmen. This right of inheritance we have never ceded nor ever forfeited.\r\nPermit us to ask what better right can the people have to a country\r\nthan the right of inheritance and immemorial peaceable possession? We\r\nknow it is said of late by the State of Georgia and by the Executive of\r\nthe United States, that we have forfeited this right; but we think this\r\nis said gratuitously. At what time have we made the forfeit? What great\r\ncrime have we committed, whereby we must forever be divested of our\r\ncountry and rights? Was it when we were hostile to the United States,\r\nand took part with the King of Great Britain, during the struggle for\r\nindependence? If so, why was not this forfeiture declared in the first\r\ntreaty of peace between the United States and our beloved men? Why was\r\nnot such an article as the following inserted in the treaty:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98The\r\nUnited States give peace to the Cherokees, but, for the part they took\r\nin the late war, declare them to be but tenants at will, to be removed\r\nwhen the convenience of the States, within whose chartered limits they\r\nlive, shall require it\xe2\x80\x99? That was the proper time to assume such a\r\npossession. But it was not thought of, nor would our forefathers have\r\nagreed to any treaty whose tendency was to deprive them of their rights\r\nand their country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch is the language of the Indians: their assertions are true, their\r\nforebodings inevitable. From whichever side we consider the destinies\r\nof the aborigines of North America, their calamities appear to be\r\nirremediable: if they continue barbarous, they are forced to retire; if\r\nthey attempt to civilize their manners, the contact of a more civilized\r\ncommunity subjects them to oppression and destitution. They perish if\r\nthey continue to wander from waste to waste, and if they attempt to\r\nsettle they still must perish; the assistance of Europeans is necessary\r\nto instruct them, but the approach of Europeans corrupts and repels\r\nthem into savage life; they refuse to change their habits as long as\r\ntheir solitudes are their own, and it is too late to change them when\r\nthey are constrained to submit.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards pursued the Indians with bloodhounds, like wild beasts;\r\nthey sacked the New World with no more temper or compassion than a city\r\ntaken by storm; but destruction must cease, and frenzy be stayed; the\r\nremnant of the Indian population which had escaped the massacre mixed\r\nwith its conquerors, and adopted in the end their religion and their\r\nmanners. *b The conduct of the Americans of the United States towards\r\nthe aborigines is characterized, on the other hand, by a singular\r\nattachment to the formalities of law. Provided that the Indians retain\r\ntheir barbarous condition, the Americans take no part in their affairs;\r\nthey treat them as independent nations, and do not possess themselves\r\nof their hunting grounds without a treaty of purchase; and if an Indian\r\nnation happens to be so encroached upon as to be unable to subsist upon\r\nits territory, they afford it brotherly assistance in transporting it\r\nto a grave sufficiently remote from the land of its fathers.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ The honor of this result is, however, by no means due to the\r\nSpaniards. If the Indian tribes had not been tillers of the ground at\r\nthe time of the arrival of the Europeans, they would unquestionably\r\nhave been destroyed in South as well as in North America.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were unable to exterminate the Indian race by those\r\nunparalleled atrocities which brand them with indelible shame, nor did\r\nthey even succeed in wholly depriving it of its rights; but the\r\nAmericans of the United States have accomplished this twofold purpose\r\nwith singular felicity; tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without\r\nshedding blood, and without violating a single great principle of\r\nmorality in the eyes of the world. *c It is impossible to destroy men\r\nwith more respect for the laws of humanity.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ See, amongst other documents, the report made by Mr. Bell in the name\r\nof the Committee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, in which is most\r\nlogically established and most learnedly proved, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe fundamental\r\nprinciple that the Indians had no right by virtue of their ancient\r\npossession either of will or sovereignty, has never been abandoned\r\neither expressly or by implication.\xe2\x80\x9d In perusing this report, which is\r\nevidently drawn up by an experienced hand, one is astonished at the\r\nfacility with which the author gets rid of all arguments founded upon\r\nreason and natural right, which he designates as abstract and\r\ntheoretical principles. The more I contemplate the difference between\r\ncivilized and uncivilized man with regard to the principles of justice,\r\nthe more I observe that the former contests the justice of those rights\r\nwhich the latter simply violates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[I leave this chapter wholly unchanged, for it has always appeared to\r\nme to be one of the most eloquent and touching parts of this book. But\r\nit has ceased to be prophetic; the destruction of the Indian race in\r\nthe United States is already consummated. In 1870 there remained but\r\n25,731 Indians in the whole territory of the Union, and of these by far\r\nthe largest part exist in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Dakota, and\r\nNew Mexico and Nevada. In New England, Pennsylvania, and New York the\r\nrace is extinct; and the predictions of M. de Tocqueville are\r\nfulfilled. \xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]\r\n\r\nSituation Of The Black Population In The United States, And Dangers\r\nWith Which Its Presence Threatens The Whites\r\n\r\nWhy it is more difficult to abolish slavery, and to efface all vestiges\r\nof it amongst the moderns than it was amongst the ancients\xe2\x80\x94In the\r\nUnited States the prejudices of the Whites against the Blacks seem to\r\nincrease in proportion as slavery is abolished\xe2\x80\x94Situation of the Negroes\r\nin the Northern and Southern States\xe2\x80\x94Why the Americans abolish\r\nslavery\xe2\x80\x94Servitude, which debases the slave, impoverishes the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94Contrast between the left and the right bank of the Ohio\xe2\x80\x94To what\r\nattributable\xe2\x80\x94The Black race, as well as slavery, recedes towards the\r\nSouth\xe2\x80\x94Explanation of this fact\xe2\x80\x94Difficulties attendant upon the\r\nabolition of slavery in the South\xe2\x80\x94Dangers to come\xe2\x80\x94General\r\nanxiety\xe2\x80\x94Foundation of a Black colony in Africa\xe2\x80\x94Why the Americans of the\r\nSouth increase the hardships of slavery, whilst they are distressed at\r\nits continuance.\r\n\r\nThe Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in which they\r\nhave lived; but the destiny of the negroes is in some measure\r\ninterwoven with that of the Europeans. These two races are attached to\r\neach other without intermingling, and they are alike unable entirely to\r\nseparate or to combine. The most formidable of all the ills which\r\nthreaten the future existence of the Union arises from the presence of\r\na black population upon its territory; and in contemplating the cause\r\nof the present embarrassments or of the future dangers of the United\r\nStates, the observer is invariably led to consider this as a primary\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe permanent evils to which mankind is subjected are usually produced\r\nby the vehement or the increasing efforts of men; but there is one\r\ncalamity which penetrated furtively into the world, and which was at\r\nfirst scarcely distinguishable amidst the ordinary abuses of power; it\r\noriginated with an individual whose name history has not preserved; it\r\nwas wafted like some accursed germ upon a portion of the soil, but it\r\nafterwards nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spreads naturally\r\nwith the society to which it belongs. I need scarcely add that this\r\ncalamity is slavery. Christianity suppressed slavery, but the\r\nChristians of the sixteenth century re-established it\xe2\x80\x94as an exception,\r\nindeed, to their social system, and restricted to one of the races of\r\nmankind; but the wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though less\r\nextensive, was at the same time rendered far more difficult of cure.\r\n\r\nIt is important to make an accurate distinction between slavery itself\r\nand its consequences. The immediate evils which are produced by slavery\r\nwere very nearly the same in antiquity as they are amongst the moderns;\r\nbut the consequences of these evils were different. The slave, amongst\r\nthe ancients, belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often\r\nthe superior of the two in education *d and instruction. Freedom was\r\nthe only distinction between them; and when freedom was conferred they\r\nwere easily confounded together. The ancients, then, had a very simple\r\nmeans of avoiding slavery and its evil consequences, which was that of\r\naffranchisement; and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this\r\nmeasure generally. Not but, in ancient States, the vestiges of\r\nservitude subsisted for some time after servitude itself was abolished.\r\nThere is a natural prejudice which prompts men to despise whomsoever\r\nhas been their inferior long after he is become their equal; and the\r\nreal inequality which is produced by fortune or by law is always\r\nsucceeded by an imaginary inequality which is implanted in the manners\r\nof the people. Nevertheless, this secondary consequence of slavery was\r\nlimited to a certain term amongst the ancients, for the freedman bore\r\nso entire a resemblance to those born free, that it soon became\r\nimpossible to distinguish him from amongst them.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ It is well known that several of the most distinguished authors of\r\nantiquity, and amongst them Aesop and Terence, were, or had been\r\nslaves. Slaves were not always taken from barbarous nations, and the\r\nchances of war reduced highly civilized men to servitude.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the law;\r\namongst the moderns it is that of altering the manners; and, as far as\r\nwe are concerned, the real obstacles begin where those of the ancients\r\nleft off. This arises from the circumstance that, amongst the moderns,\r\nthe abstract and transient fact of slavery is fatally united to the\r\nphysical and permanent fact of color. The tradition of slavery\r\ndishonors the race, and the peculiarity of the race perpetuates the\r\ntradition of slavery. No African has ever voluntarily emigrated to the\r\nshores of the New World; whence it must be inferred, that all the\r\nblacks who are now to be found in that hemisphere are either slaves or\r\nfreedmen. Thus the negro transmits the eternal mark of his ignominy to\r\nall his descendants; and although the law may abolish slavery, God\r\nalone can obliterate the traces of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe modern slave differs from his master not only in his condition, but\r\nin his origin. You may set the negro free, but you cannot make him\r\notherwise than an alien to the European. Nor is this all; we scarcely\r\nacknowledge the common features of mankind in this child of debasement\r\nwhom slavery has brought amongst us. His physiognomy is to our eyes\r\nhideous, his understanding weak, his tastes low; and we are almost\r\ninclined to look upon him as a being intermediate between man and the\r\nbrutes. *e The moderns, then, after they have abolished slavery, have\r\nthree prejudices to contend against, which are less easy to attack and\r\nfar less easy to conquer than the mere fact of servitude: the prejudice\r\nof the master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice of color.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have conceived of\r\nthe moral and intellectual inferiority of their former slaves, the\r\nnegroes must change; but as long as this opinion subsists, to change is\r\nimpossible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born\r\namongst men like ourselves by nature, and equal to ourselves by law, to\r\nconceive the irreconcilable differences which separate the negro from\r\nthe European in America. But we may derive some faint notion of them\r\nfrom analogy. France was formerly a country in which numerous\r\ndistinctions of rank existed, that had been created by the legislation.\r\nNothing can be more fictitious than a purely legal inferiority; nothing\r\nmore contrary to the instinct of mankind than these permanent divisions\r\nwhich had been established between beings evidently similar.\r\nNevertheless these divisions subsisted for ages; they still subsist in\r\nmany places; and on all sides they have left imaginary vestiges, which\r\ntime alone can efface. If it be so difficult to root out an inequality\r\nwhich solely originates in the law, how are those distinctions to be\r\ndestroyed which seem to be based upon the immutable laws of Nature\r\nherself? When I remember the extreme difficulty with which aristocratic\r\nbodies, of whatever nature they may be, are commingled with the mass of\r\nthe people; and the exceeding care which they take to preserve the\r\nideal boundaries of their caste inviolate, I despair of seeing an\r\naristocracy disappear which is founded upon visible and indelible\r\nsigns. Those who hope that the Europeans will ever mix with the\r\nnegroes, appear to me to delude themselves; and I am not led to any\r\nsuch conclusion by my own reason, or by the evidence of facts.\r\n\r\nHitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have\r\nmaintained the blacks in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever\r\nthe negroes have been strongest they have destroyed the whites; such\r\nhas been the only retribution which has ever taken place between the\r\ntwo races.\r\n\r\nI see that in a certain portion of the territory of the United States\r\nat the present day, the legal barrier which separated the two races is\r\ntending to fall away, but not that which exists in the manners of the\r\ncountry; slavery recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth\r\nremains stationary. Whosoever has inhabited the United States must have\r\nperceived that in those parts of the Union in which the negroes are no\r\nlonger slaves, they have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites. On the\r\ncontrary, the prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in the\r\nStates which have abolished slavery, than in those where it still\r\nexists; and nowhere is it so intolerant as in those States where\r\nservitude has never been known.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in the North of the Union, marriages may be legally\r\ncontracted between negroes and whites; but public opinion would\r\nstigmatize a man who should connect himself with a negress as infamous,\r\nand it would be difficult to meet with a single instance of such a\r\nunion. The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in\r\nalmost all the States in which slavery has been abolished; but if they\r\ncome forward to vote, their lives are in danger. If oppressed, they may\r\nbring an action at law, but they will find none but whites amongst\r\ntheir judges; and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice\r\nrepulses them from that office. The same schools do not receive the\r\nchild of the black and of the European. In the theatres, gold cannot\r\nprocure a seat for the servile race beside their former masters; in the\r\nhospitals they lie apart; and although they are allowed to invoke the\r\nsame Divinity as the whites, it must be at a different altar, and in\r\ntheir own churches, with their own clergy. The gates of Heaven are not\r\nclosed against these unhappy beings; but their inferiority is continued\r\nto the very confines of the other world; when the negro is defunct, his\r\nbones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition prevails even in\r\nthe equality of death. The negro is free, but he can share neither the\r\nrights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor, nor the afflictions, nor the\r\ntomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet\r\nhim upon fair terms in life or in death.\r\n\r\nIn the South, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less\r\ncarefully kept apart; they sometimes share the labor and the\r\nrecreations of the whites; the whites consent to intermix with them to\r\na certain extent, and although the legislation treats them more\r\nharshly, the habits of the people are more tolerant and compassionate.\r\nIn the South the master is not afraid to raise his slave to his own\r\nstanding, because he knows that he can in a moment reduce him to the\r\ndust at pleasure. In the North the white no longer distinctly perceives\r\nthe barrier which separates him from the degraded race, and he shuns\r\nthe negro with the more pertinacity, since he fears lest they should\r\nsome day be confounded together.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Americans of the South, nature sometimes reasserts her\r\nrights, and restores a transient equality between the blacks and the\r\nwhites; but in the North pride restrains the most imperious of human\r\npassions. The American of the Northern States would perhaps allow the\r\nnegress to share his licentious pleasures, if the laws of his country\r\ndid not declare that she may aspire to be the legitimate partner of his\r\nbed; but he recoils with horror from her who might become his wife.\r\n\r\nThus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which repels the\r\nnegroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated, and\r\ninequality is sanctioned by the manners whilst it is effaced from the\r\nlaws of the country. But if the relative position of the two races\r\nwhich inhabit the United States is such as I have described, it may be\r\nasked why the Americans have abolished slavery in the North of the\r\nUnion, why they maintain it in the South, and why they aggravate its\r\nhardships there? The answer is easily given. It is not for the good of\r\nthe negroes, but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to\r\nabolish slavery in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first negroes were imported into Virginia about the year 1621. *f\r\nIn America, therefore, as well as in the rest of the globe, slavery\r\noriginated in the South. Thence it spread from one settlement to\r\nanother; but the number of slaves diminished towards the Northern\r\nStates, and the negro population was always very limited in New\r\nEngland. *g\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ See Beverley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Virginia.\xe2\x80\x9d See also in Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMemoirs\xe2\x80\x9d some curious details concerning the introduction of negroes\r\ninto Virginia, and the first Act which prohibited the importation of\r\nthem in 1778.]\r\n\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ The number of slaves was less considerable in the North, but the\r\nadvantages resulting from slavery were not more contested there than in\r\nthe South. In 1740, the Legislature of the State of New York declared\r\nthat the direct importation of slaves ought to be encouraged as much as\r\npossible, and smuggling severely punished in order not to discourage\r\nthe fair trader. (Kent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. ii. p. 206.) Curious\r\nresearches, by Belknap, upon slavery in New England, are to be found in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cHistorical Collection of Massachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. iv. p. 193. It\r\nappears that negroes were introduced there in 1630, but that the\r\nlegislation and manners of the people were opposed to slavery from the\r\nfirst; see also, in the same work, the manner in which public opinion,\r\nand afterwards the laws, finally put an end to slavery.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies,\r\nwhen the attention of the planters was struck by the extraordinary\r\nfact, that the provinces which were comparatively destitute of slaves,\r\nincreased in population, in wealth, and in prosperity more rapidly than\r\nthose which contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former,\r\nhowever, the inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves,\r\nor by hired laborers; in the latter they were furnished with hands for\r\nwhich they paid no wages; yet although labor and expenses were on the\r\none side, and ease with economy on the other, the former were in\r\npossession of the most advantageous system. This consequence seemed to\r\nbe the more difficult to explain, since the settlers, who all belonged\r\nto the same European race, had the same habits, the same civilization,\r\nthe same laws, and their shades of difference were extremely slight.\r\n\r\nTime, however, continued to advance, and the Anglo-Americans, spreading\r\nbeyond the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, penetrated farther and farther\r\ninto the solitudes of the West; they met with a new soil and an\r\nunwonted climate; the obstacles which opposed them were of the most\r\nvarious character; their races intermingled, the inhabitants of the\r\nSouth went up towards the North, those of the North descended to the\r\nSouth; but in the midst of all these causes, the same result occurred\r\nat every step, and in general, the colonies in which there were no\r\nslaves became more populous and more rich than those in which slavery\r\nflourished. The more progress was made, the more was it shown that\r\nslavery, which is so cruel to the slave, is prejudicial to the master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part IV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this truth was most satisfactorily demonstrated when civilization\r\nreached the banks of the Ohio. The stream which the Indians had\r\ndistinguished by the name of Ohio, or Beautiful River, waters one of\r\nthe most magnificent valleys that has ever been made the abode of man.\r\nUndulating lands extend upon both shores of the Ohio, whose soil\r\naffords inexhaustible treasures to the laborer; on either bank the air\r\nis wholesome and the climate mild, and each of them forms the extreme\r\nfrontier of a vast State: That which follows the numerous windings of\r\nthe Ohio upon the left is called Kentucky, that upon the right bears\r\nthe name of the river. These two States only differ in a single\r\nrespect; Kentucky has admitted slavery, but the State of Ohio has\r\nprohibited the existence of slaves within its borders. *h\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ Not only is slavery prohibited in Ohio, but no free negroes are\r\nallowed to enter the territory of that State, or to hold property in\r\nit. See the Statutes of Ohio.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the traveller who floats down the current of the Ohio to the spot\r\nwhere that river falls into the Mississippi, may be said to sail\r\nbetween liberty and servitude; and a transient inspection of the\r\nsurrounding objects will convince him as to which of the two is most\r\nfavorable to mankind. Upon the left bank of the stream the population\r\nis rare; from time to time one descries a troop of slaves loitering in\r\nthe half-desert fields; the primaeval forest recurs at every turn;\r\nsociety seems to be asleep, man to be idle, and nature alone offers a\r\nscene of activity and of life. From the right bank, on the contrary, a\r\nconfused hum is heard which proclaims the presence of industry; the\r\nfields are covered with abundant harvests, the elegance of the\r\ndwellings announces the taste and activity of the laborer, and man\r\nappears to be in the enjoyment of that wealth and contentment which is\r\nthe reward of labor. *i\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ The activity of Ohio is not confined to individuals, but the\r\nundertakings of the State are surprisingly great; a canal has been\r\nestablished between Lake Erie and the Ohio, by means of which the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi communicates with the river of the North, and\r\nthe European commodities which arrive at New York may be forwarded by\r\nwater to New Orleans across five hundred leagues of continent.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State of Kentucky was founded in 1775, the State of Ohio only\r\ntwelve years later; but twelve years are more in America than half a\r\ncentury in Europe, and, at the present day, the population of Ohio\r\nexceeds that of Kentucky by two hundred and fifty thousand souls. *j\r\nThese opposite consequences of slavery and freedom may readily be\r\nunderstood, and they suffice to explain many of the differences which\r\nwe remark between the civilization of antiquity and that of our own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ The exact numbers given by the census of 1830 were: Kentucky,\r\n688,-844; Ohio, 937,679. [In 1890 the population of Ohio was 3,672,316,\r\nthat of Kentucky, 1,858,635.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the left bank of the Ohio labor is confounded with the idea of\r\nslavery, upon the right bank it is identified with that of prosperity\r\nand improvement; on the one side it is degraded, on the other it is\r\nhonored; on the former territory no white laborers can be found, for\r\nthey would be afraid of assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the\r\nlatter no one is idle, for the white population extends its activity\r\nand its intelligence to every kind of employment. Thus the men whose\r\ntask it is to cultivate the rich soil of Kentucky are ignorant and\r\nlukewarm; whilst those who are active and enlightened either do nothing\r\nor pass over into the State of Ohio, where they may work without\r\ndishonor.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in Kentucky the planters are not obliged to pay wages\r\nto the slaves whom they employ; but they derive small profits from\r\ntheir labor, whilst the wages paid to free workmen would be returned\r\nwith interest in the value of their services. The free workman is paid,\r\nbut he does his work quicker than the slave, and rapidity of execution\r\nis one of the great elements of economy. The white sells his services,\r\nbut they are only purchased at the times at which they may be useful;\r\nthe black can claim no remuneration for his toil, but the expense of\r\nhis maintenance is perpetual; he must be supported in his old age as\r\nwell as in the prime of manhood, in his profitless infancy as well as\r\nin the productive years of youth. Payment must equally be made in order\r\nto obtain the services of either class of men: the free workman\r\nreceives his wages in money, the slave in education, in food, in care,\r\nand in clothing. The money which a master spends in the maintenance of\r\nhis slaves goes gradually and in detail, so that it is scarcely\r\nperceived; the salary of the free workman is paid in a round sum, which\r\nappears only to enrich the individual who receives it, but in the end\r\nthe slave has cost more than the free servant, and his labor is less\r\nproductive. *k\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ Independently of these causes, which, wherever free workmen abound,\r\nrender their labor more productive and more economical than that of\r\nslaves, another cause may be pointed out which is peculiar to the\r\nUnited States: the sugar-cane has hitherto been cultivated with success\r\nonly upon the banks of the Mississippi, near the mouth of that river in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. In Louisiana the cultivation of the sugar-cane is\r\nexceedingly lucrative, and nowhere does a laborer earn so much by his\r\nwork, and, as there is always a certain relation between the cost of\r\nproduction and the value of the produce, the price of slaves is very\r\nhigh in Louisiana. But Louisiana is one of the confederated States, and\r\nslaves may be carried thither from all parts of the Union; the price\r\ngiven for slaves in New Orleans consequently raises the value of slaves\r\nin all the other markets. The consequence of this is, that in the\r\ncountries where the land is less productive, the cost of slave labor is\r\nstill very considerable, which gives an additional advantage to the\r\ncompetition of free labor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of slavery extends still further; it affects the\r\ncharacter of the master, and imparts a peculiar tendency to his ideas\r\nand his tastes. Upon both banks of the Ohio, the character of the\r\ninhabitants is enterprising and energetic; but this vigor is very\r\ndifferently exercised in the two States. The white inhabitant of Ohio,\r\nwho is obliged to subsist by his own exertions, regards temporal\r\nprosperity as the principal aim of his existence; and as the country\r\nwhich he occupies presents inexhaustible resources to his industry and\r\never-varying lures to his activity, his acquisitive ardor surpasses the\r\nordinary limits of human cupidity: he is tormented by the desire of\r\nwealth, and he boldly enters upon every path which fortune opens to\r\nhim; he becomes a sailor, a pioneer, an artisan, or a laborer with the\r\nsame indifference, and he supports, with equal constancy, the fatigues\r\nand the dangers incidental to these various professions; the resources\r\nof his intelligence are astonishing, and his avidity in the pursuit of\r\ngain amounts to a species of heroism.\r\n\r\nBut the Kentuckian scorns not only labor, but all the undertakings\r\nwhich labor promotes; as he lives in an idle independence, his tastes\r\nare those of an idle man; money loses a portion of its value in his\r\neyes; he covets wealth much less than pleasure and excitement; and the\r\nenergy which his neighbor devotes to gain, turns with him to a\r\npassionate love of field sports and military exercises; he delights in\r\nviolent bodily exertion, he is familiar with the use of arms, and is\r\naccustomed from a very early age to expose his life in single combat.\r\nThus slavery not only prevents the whites from becoming opulent, but\r\neven from desiring to become so.\r\n\r\nAs the same causes have been continually producing opposite effects for\r\nthe last two centuries in the British colonies of North America, they\r\nhave established a very striking difference between the commercial\r\ncapacity of the inhabitants of the South and those of the North. At the\r\npresent day it is only the Northern States which are in possession of\r\nshipping, manufactures, railroads, and canals. This difference is\r\nperceptible not only in comparing the North with the South, but in\r\ncomparing the several Southern States. Almost all the individuals who\r\ncarry on commercial operations, or who endeavor to turn slave labor to\r\naccount in the most Southern districts of the Union, have emigrated\r\nfrom the North. The natives of the Northern States are constantly\r\nspreading over that portion of the American territory where they have\r\nless to fear from competition; they discover resources there which\r\nescaped the notice of the inhabitants; and, as they comply with a\r\nsystem which they do not approve, they succeed in turning it to better\r\nadvantage than those who first founded and who still maintain it.\r\n\r\nWere I inclined to continue this parallel, I could easily prove that\r\nalmost all the differences which may be remarked between the characters\r\nof the Americans in the Southern and in the Northern States have\r\noriginated in slavery; but this would divert me from my subject, and my\r\npresent intention is not to point out all the consequences of\r\nservitude, but those effects which it has produced upon the prosperity\r\nof the countries which have admitted it.\r\n\r\nThe influence of slavery upon the production of wealth must have been\r\nvery imperfectly known in antiquity, as slavery then obtained\r\nthroughout the civilized world; and the nations which were unacquainted\r\nwith it were barbarous. And indeed Christianity only abolished slavery\r\nby advocating the claims of the slave; at the present time it may be\r\nattacked in the name of the master, and, upon this point, interest is\r\nreconciled with morality.\r\n\r\nAs these truths became apparent in the United States, slavery receded\r\nbefore the progress of experience. Servitude had begun in the South,\r\nand had thence spread towards the North; but it now retires again.\r\nFreedom, which started from the North, now descends uninterruptedly\r\ntowards the South. Amongst the great States, Pennsylvania now\r\nconstitutes the extreme limit of slavery to the North: but even within\r\nthose limits the slave system is shaken: Maryland, which is immediately\r\nbelow Pennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and Virginia, which\r\ncomes next to Maryland, is already discussing its utility and its\r\ndangers. *l\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ A peculiar reason contributes to detach the two last-mentioned States\r\nfrom the cause of slavery. The former wealth of this part of the Union\r\nwas principally derived from the cultivation of tobacco. This\r\ncultivation is specially carried on by slaves; but within the last few\r\nyears the market-price of tobacco has diminished, whilst the value of\r\nthe slaves remains the same. Thus the ratio between the cost of\r\nproduction and the value of the produce is changed. The natives of\r\nMaryland and Virginia are therefore more disposed than they were thirty\r\nyears ago, to give up slave labor in the cultivation of tobacco, or to\r\ngive up slavery and tobacco at the same time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo great change takes place in human institutions without involving\r\namongst its causes the law of inheritance. When the law of\r\nprimogeniture obtained in the South, each family was represented by a\r\nwealthy individual, who was neither compelled nor induced to labor; and\r\nhe was surrounded, as by parasitic plants, by the other members of his\r\nfamily who were then excluded by law from sharing the common\r\ninheritance, and who led the same kind of life as himself. The very\r\nsame thing then occurred in all the families of the South as still\r\nhappens in the wealthy families of some countries in Europe, namely,\r\nthat the younger sons remain in the same state of idleness as their\r\nelder brother, without being as rich as he is. This identical result\r\nseems to be produced in Europe and in America by wholly analogous\r\ncauses. In the South of the United States the whole race of whites\r\nformed an aristocratic body, which was headed by a certain number of\r\nprivileged individuals, whose wealth was permanent, and whose leisure\r\nwas hereditary. These leaders of the American nobility kept alive the\r\ntraditional prejudices of the white race in the body of which they were\r\nthe representatives, and maintained the honor of inactive life. This\r\naristocracy contained many who were poor, but none who would work; its\r\nmembers preferred want to labor, consequently no competition was set on\r\nfoot against negro laborers and slaves, and, whatever opinion might be\r\nentertained as to the utility of their efforts, it was indispensable to\r\nemploy them, since there was no one else to work.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the law of primogeniture abolished than fortunes began to\r\ndiminish, and all the families of the country were simultaneously\r\nreduced to a state in which labor became necessary to procure the means\r\nof subsistence: several of them have since entirely disappeared, and\r\nall of them learned to look forward to the time at which it would be\r\nnecessary for everyone to provide for his own wants. Wealthy\r\nindividuals are still to be met with, but they no longer constitute a\r\ncompact and hereditary body, nor have they been able to adopt a line of\r\nconduct in which they could persevere, and which they could infuse into\r\nall ranks of society. The prejudice which stigmatized labor was in the\r\nfirst place abandoned by common consent; the number of needy men was\r\nincreased, and the needy were allowed to gain a laborious subsistence\r\nwithout blushing for their exertions. Thus one of the most immediate\r\nconsequences of the partible quality of estates has been to create a\r\nclass of free laborers. As soon as a competition was set on foot\r\nbetween the free laborer and the slave, the inferiority of the latter\r\nbecame manifest, and slavery was attacked in its fundamental principle,\r\nwhich is the interest of the master.\r\n\r\nAs slavery recedes, the black population follows its retrograde course,\r\nand returns with it towards those tropical regions from which it\r\noriginally came. However singular this fact may at first appear to be,\r\nit may readily be explained. Although the Americans abolish the\r\nprinciple of slavery, they do not set their slaves free. To illustrate\r\nthis remark, I will quote the example of the State of New York. In\r\n1788, the State of New York prohibited the sale of slaves within its\r\nlimits, which was an indirect method of prohibiting the importation of\r\nblacks. Thenceforward the number of negroes could only increase\r\naccording to the ratio of the natural increase of population. But eight\r\nyears later a more decisive measure was taken, and it was enacted that\r\nall children born of slave parents after July 4, 1799, should be free.\r\nNo increase could then take place, and although slaves still existed,\r\nslavery might be said to be abolished.\r\n\r\nFrom the time at which a Northern State prohibited the importation of\r\nslaves, no slaves were brought from the South to be sold in its\r\nmarkets. On the other hand, as the sale of slaves was forbidden in that\r\nState, an owner was no longer able to get rid of his slave (who thus\r\nbecame a burdensome possession) otherwise than by transporting him to\r\nthe South. But when a Northern State declared that the son of the slave\r\nshould be born free, the slave lost a large portion of his market\r\nvalue, since his posterity was no longer included in the bargain, and\r\nthe owner had then a strong interest in transporting him to the South.\r\nThus the same law prevents the slaves of the South from coming to the\r\nNorthern States, and drives those of the North to the South.\r\n\r\nThe want of free hands is felt in a State in proportion as the number\r\nof slaves decreases. But in proportion as labor is performed by free\r\nhands, slave labor becomes less productive; and the slave is then a\r\nuseless or onerous possession, whom it is important to export to those\r\nSouthern States where the same competition is not to be feared. Thus\r\nthe abolition of slavery does not set the slave free, but it merely\r\ntransfers him from one master to another, and from the North to the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe emancipated negroes, and those born after the abolition of slavery,\r\ndo not, indeed, migrate from the North to the South; but their\r\nsituation with regard to the Europeans is not unlike that of the\r\naborigines of America; they remain half civilized, and deprived of\r\ntheir rights in the midst of a population which is far superior to them\r\nin wealth and in knowledge; where they are exposed to the tyranny of\r\nthe laws *m and the intolerance of the people. On some accounts they\r\nare still more to be pitied than the Indians, since they are haunted by\r\nthe reminiscence of slavery, and they cannot claim possession of a\r\nsingle portion of the soil: many of them perish miserably, *n and the\r\nrest congregate in the great towns, where they perform the meanest\r\noffices, and lead a wretched and precarious existence.\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ The States in which slavery is abolished usually do what they can to\r\nrender their territory disagreeable to the negroes as a place of\r\nresidence; and as a kind of emulation exists between the different\r\nStates in this respect, the unhappy blacks can only choose the least of\r\nthe evils which beset them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ There is a very great difference between the mortality of the blacks\r\nand of the whites in the States in which slavery is abolished; from\r\n1820 to 1831 only one out of forty-two individuals of the white\r\npopulation died in Philadelphia; but one negro out of twenty-one\r\nindividuals of the black population died in the same space of time. The\r\nmortality is by no means so great amongst the negroes who are still\r\nslaves. (See Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMedical Statistics,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 28.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even if the number of negroes continued to increase as rapidly as\r\nwhen they were still in a state of slavery, as the number of whites\r\naugments with twofold rapidity since the abolition of slavery, the\r\nblacks would soon be, as it were, lost in the midst of a strange\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nA district which is cultivated by slaves is in general more scantily\r\npeopled than a district cultivated by free labor: moreover, America is\r\nstill a new country, and a State is therefore not half peopled at the\r\ntime when it abolishes slavery. No sooner is an end put to slavery than\r\nthe want of free labor is felt, and a crowd of enterprising adventurers\r\nimmediately arrive from all parts of the country, who hasten to profit\r\nby the fresh resources which are then opened to industry. The soil is\r\nsoon divided amongst them, and a family of white settlers takes\r\npossession of each tract of country. Besides which, European emigration\r\nis exclusively directed to the free States; for what would be the fate\r\nof a poor emigrant who crosses the Atlantic in search of ease and\r\nhappiness if he were to land in a country where labor is stigmatized as\r\ndegrading?\r\n\r\nThus the white population grows by its natural increase, and at the\r\nsame time by the immense influx of emigrants; whilst the black\r\npopulation receives no emigrants, and is upon its decline. The\r\nproportion which existed between the two races is soon inverted. The\r\nnegroes constitute a scanty remnant, a poor tribe of vagrants, which is\r\nlost in the midst of an immense people in full possession of the land;\r\nand the presence of the blacks is only marked by the injustice and the\r\nhardships of which they are the unhappy victims.\r\n\r\nIn several of the Western States the negro race never made its\r\nappearance, and in all the Northern States it is rapidly declining.\r\nThus the great question of its future condition is confined within a\r\nnarrow circle, where it becomes less formidable, though not more easy\r\nof solution.\r\n\r\nThe more we descend towards the South, the more difficult does it\r\nbecome to abolish slavery with advantage: and this arises from several\r\nphysical causes which it is important to point out.\r\n\r\nThe first of these causes is the climate; it is well known that in\r\nproportion as Europeans approach the tropics they suffer more from\r\nlabor. Many of the Americans even assert that within a certain latitude\r\nthe exertions which a negro can make without danger are fatal to them;\r\n*o but I do not think that this opinion, which is so favorable to the\r\nindolence of the inhabitants of southern regions, is confirmed by\r\nexperience. The southern parts of the Union are not hotter than the\r\nSouth of Italy and of Spain; *p and it may be asked why the European\r\ncannot work as well there as in the two latter countries. If slavery\r\nhas been abolished in Italy and in Spain without causing the\r\ndestruction of the masters, why should not the same thing take place in\r\nthe Union? I cannot believe that nature has prohibited the Europeans in\r\nGeorgia and the Floridas, under pain of death, from raising the means\r\nof subsistence from the soil, but their labor would unquestionably be\r\nmore irksome and less productive to them than to the inhabitants of New\r\nEngland. As the free workman thus loses a portion of his superiority\r\nover the slave in the Southern States, there are fewer inducements to\r\nabolish slavery.\r\n\r\no\r\n[ This is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated; rice-grounds,\r\nwhich are unwholesome in all countries, are particularly dangerous in\r\nthose regions which are exposed to the beams of a tropical sun.\r\nEuropeans would not find it easy to cultivate the soil in that part of\r\nthe New World if it must be necessarily be made to produce rice; but\r\nmay they not subsist without rice-grounds?]\r\n\r\n\r\np\r\n[ These States are nearer to the equator than Italy and Spain, but the\r\ntemperature of the continent of America is very much lower than that of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government formerly caused a certain number of peasants\r\nfrom the Acores to be transported into a district of Louisiana called\r\nAttakapas, by way of experiment. These settlers still cultivate the\r\nsoil without the assistance of slaves, but their industry is so languid\r\nas scarcely to supply their most necessary wants.]\r\n\r\nAll the plants of Europe grow in the northern parts of the Union; the\r\nSouth has special productions of its own. It has been observed that\r\nslave labor is a very expensive method of cultivating corn. The farmer\r\nof corn land in a country where slavery is unknown habitually retains a\r\nsmall number of laborers in his service, and at seed-time and harvest\r\nhe hires several additional hands, who only live at his cost for a\r\nshort period. But the agriculturist in a slave State is obliged to keep\r\na large number of slaves the whole year round, in order to sow his\r\nfields and to gather in his crops, although their services are only\r\nrequired for a few weeks; but slaves are unable to wait till they are\r\nhired, and to subsist by their own labor in the mean time like free\r\nlaborers; in order to have their services they must be bought. Slavery,\r\nindependently of its general disadvantages, is therefore still more\r\ninapplicable to countries in which corn is cultivated than to those\r\nwhich produce crops of a different kind. The cultivation of tobacco, of\r\ncotton, and especially of the sugar-cane, demands, on the other hand,\r\nunremitting attention: and women and children are employed in it, whose\r\nservices are of but little use in the cultivation of wheat. Thus\r\nslavery is naturally more fitted to the countries from which these\r\nproductions are derived. Tobacco, cotton, and the sugar-cane are\r\nexclusively grown in the South, and they form one of the principal\r\nsources of the wealth of those States. If slavery were abolished, the\r\ninhabitants of the South would be constrained to adopt one of two\r\nalternatives: they must either change their system of cultivation, and\r\nthen they would come into competition with the more active and more\r\nexperienced inhabitants of the North; or, if they continued to\r\ncultivate the same produce without slave labor, they would have to\r\nsupport the competition of the other States of the South, which might\r\nstill retain their slaves. Thus, peculiar reasons for maintaining\r\nslavery exist in the South which do not operate in the North.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another motive which is more cogent than all the\r\nothers: the South might indeed, rigorously speaking, abolish slavery;\r\nbut how should it rid its territory of the black population? Slaves and\r\nslavery are driven from the North by the same law, but this twofold\r\nresult cannot be hoped for in the South.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which I have adduced to show that slavery is more natural\r\nand more advantageous in the South than in the North, sufficiently\r\nprove that the number of slaves must be far greater in the former\r\ndistricts. It was to the southern settlements that the first Africans\r\nwere brought, and it is there that the greatest number of them have\r\nalways been imported. As we advance towards the South, the prejudice\r\nwhich sanctions idleness increases in power. In the States nearest to\r\nthe tropics there is not a single white laborer; the negroes are\r\nconsequently much more numerous in the South than in the North. And, as\r\nI have already observed, this disproportion increases daily, since the\r\nnegroes are transferred to one part of the Union as soon as slavery is\r\nabolished in the other. Thus the black population augments in the\r\nSouth, not only by its natural fecundity, but by the compulsory\r\nemigration of the negroes from the North; and the African race has\r\ncauses of increase in the South very analogous to those which so\r\npowerfully accelerate the growth of the European race in the North.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Maine there is one negro in 300 inhabitants; in\r\nMassachusetts, one in 100; in New York, two in 100; in Pennsylvania,\r\nthree in the same number; in Maryland, thirty-four; in Virginia,\r\nforty-two; and lastly, in South Carolina *q fifty-five per cent. Such\r\nwas the proportion of the black population to the whites in the year\r\n1830. But this proportion is perpetually changing, as it constantly\r\ndecreases in the North and augments in the South.\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ We find it asserted in an American work, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cLetters on the\r\nColonization Society,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Carey, 1833, \xe2\x80\x9cThat for the last forty\r\nyears the black race has increased more rapidly than the white race in\r\nthe State of South Carolina; and that if we take the average population\r\nof the five States of the South into which slaves were first\r\nintroduced, viz., Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina,\r\nand Georgia, we shall find that from 1790 to 1830 the whites have\r\naugmented in the proportion of 80 to 100, and the blacks in that of 112\r\nto 100.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States, in 1830, the population of the two races stood as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nStates where slavery is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520 blacks.\r\nSlave States, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,102 blacks. [In 1890 the United\r\nStates contained a population of 54,983,890 whites, and 7,638,360\r\nnegroes.]]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the most Southern States of the Union cannot abolish\r\nslavery without incurring very great dangers, which the North had no\r\nreason to apprehend when it emancipated its black population. We have\r\nalready shown the system by which the Northern States secure the\r\ntransition from slavery to freedom, by keeping the present generation\r\nin chains, and setting their descendants free; by this means the\r\nnegroes are gradually introduced into society; and whilst the men who\r\nmight abuse their freedom are kept in a state of servitude, those who\r\nare emancipated may learn the art of being free before they become\r\ntheir own masters. But it would be difficult to apply this method in\r\nthe South. To declare that all the negroes born after a certain period\r\nshall be free, is to introduce the principle and the notion of liberty\r\ninto the heart of slavery; the blacks whom the law thus maintains in a\r\nstate of slavery from which their children are delivered, are\r\nastonished at so unequal a fate, and their astonishment is only the\r\nprelude to their impatience and irritation. Thenceforward slavery\r\nloses, in their eyes, that kind of moral power which it derived from\r\ntime and habit; it is reduced to a mere palpable abuse of force. The\r\nNorthern States had nothing to fear from the contrast, because in them\r\nthe blacks were few in number, and the white population was very\r\nconsiderable. But if this faint dawn of freedom were to show two\r\nmillions of men their true position, the oppressors would have reason\r\nto tremble. After having affranchised the children of their slaves the\r\nEuropeans of the Southern States would very shortly be obliged to\r\nextend the same benefit to the whole black population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part V\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the North, as I have already remarked, a twofold migration ensues\r\nupon the abolition of slavery, or even precedes that event when\r\ncircumstances have rendered it probable; the slaves quit the country to\r\nbe transported southwards; and the whites of the Northern States, as\r\nwell as the emigrants from Europe, hasten to fill up their place. But\r\nthese two causes cannot operate in the same manner in the Southern\r\nStates. On the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great for any\r\nexpectation of their ever being removed from the country to be\r\nentertained; and on the other hand, the Europeans and Anglo-Americans\r\nof the North are afraid to come to inhabit a country in which labor has\r\nnot yet been reinstated in its rightful honors. Besides, they very\r\njustly look upon the States in which the proportion of the negroes\r\nequals or exceeds that of the whites, as exposed to very great dangers;\r\nand they refrain from turning their activity in that direction.\r\n\r\nThus the inhabitants of the South would not be able, like their\r\nNorthern countrymen, to initiate the slaves gradually into a state of\r\nfreedom by abolishing slavery; they have no means of perceptibly\r\ndiminishing the black population, and they would remain unsupported to\r\nrepress its excesses. So that in the course of a few years, a great\r\npeople of free negroes would exist in the heart of a white nation of\r\nequal size.\r\n\r\nThe same abuses of power which still maintain slavery, would then\r\nbecome the source of the most alarming perils which the white\r\npopulation of the South might have to apprehend. At the present time\r\nthe descendants of the Europeans are the sole owners of the land; the\r\nabsolute masters of all labor; and the only persons who are possessed\r\nof wealth, knowledge, and arms. The black is destitute of all these\r\nadvantages, but he subsists without them because he is a slave. If he\r\nwere free, and obliged to provide for his own subsistence, would it be\r\npossible for him to remain without these things and to support life? Or\r\nwould not the very instruments of the present superiority of the white,\r\nwhilst slavery exists, expose him to a thousand dangers if it were\r\nabolished?\r\n\r\nAs long as the negro remains a slave, he may be kept in a condition not\r\nvery far removed from that of the brutes; but, with his liberty, he\r\ncannot but acquire a degree of instruction which will enable him to\r\nappreciate his misfortunes, and to discern a remedy for them. Moreover,\r\nthere exists a singular principle of relative justice which is very\r\nfirmly implanted in the human heart. Men are much more forcibly struck\r\nby those inequalities which exist within the circle of the same class,\r\nthan with those which may be remarked between different classes. It is\r\nmore easy for them to admit slavery, than to allow several millions of\r\ncitizens to exist under a load of eternal infamy and hereditary\r\nwretchedness. In the North the population of freed negroes feels these\r\nhardships and resents these indignities; but its numbers and its powers\r\nare small, whilst in the South it would be numerous and strong.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emancipated blacks\r\nare placed upon the same territory in the situation of two alien\r\ncommunities, it will readily be understood that there are but two\r\nalternatives for the future; the negroes and the whites must either\r\nwholly part or wholly mingle. I have already expressed the conviction\r\nwhich I entertain as to the latter event. *r I do not imagine that the\r\nwhite and black races will ever live in any country upon an equal\r\nfooting. But I believe the difficulty to be still greater in the United\r\nStates than elsewhere. An isolated individual may surmount the\r\nprejudices of religion, of his country, or of his race, and if this\r\nindividual is a king he may effect surprising changes in society; but a\r\nwhole people cannot rise, as it were, above itself. A despot who should\r\nsubject the Americans and their former slaves to the same yoke, might\r\nperhaps succeed in commingling their races; but as long as the American\r\ndemocracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will undertake so\r\ndifficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer the white\r\npopulation of the United States becomes, the more isolated will it\r\nremain. *s\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ This opinion is sanctioned by authorities infinitely weightier than\r\nanything that I can say: thus, for instance, it is stated in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMemoirs of Jefferson\xe2\x80\x9d (as collected by M. Conseil), \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is more\r\nclearly written in the book of destiny than the emancipation of the\r\nblacks; and it is equally certain that the two races will never live in\r\na state of equal freedom under the same government, so insurmountable\r\nare the barriers which nature, habit, and opinions have established\r\nbetween them.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ If the British West India planters had governed themselves, they\r\nwould assuredly not have passed the Slave Emancipation Bill which the\r\nmother-country has recently imposed upon them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have previously observed that the mixed race is the true bond of\r\nunion between the Europeans and the Indians; just so the mulattoes are\r\nthe true means of transition between the white and the negro; so that\r\nwherever mulattoes abound, the intermixture of the two races is not\r\nimpossible. In some parts of America, the European and the negro races\r\nare so crossed by one another, that it is rare to meet with a man who\r\nis entirely black, or entirely white: when they are arrived at this\r\npoint, the two races may really be said to be combined; or rather to\r\nhave been absorbed in a third race, which is connected with both\r\nwithout being identical with either.\r\n\r\nOf all the Europeans the English are those who have mixed least with\r\nthe negroes. More mulattoes are to be seen in the South of the Union\r\nthan in the North, but still they are infinitely more scarce than in\r\nany other European colony: mulattoes are by no means numerous in the\r\nUnited States; they have no force peculiar to themselves, and when\r\nquarrels originating in differences of color take place, they generally\r\nside with the whites; just as the lackeys of the great, in Europe,\r\nassume the contemptuous airs of nobility to the lower orders.\r\n\r\nThe pride of origin, which is natural to the English, is singularly\r\naugmented by the personal pride which democratic liberty fosters\r\namongst the Americans: the white citizen of the United States is proud\r\nof his race, and proud of himself. But if the whites and the negroes do\r\nnot intermingle in the North of the Union, how should they mix in the\r\nSouth? Can it be supposed for an instant, that an American of the\r\nSouthern States, placed, as he must forever be, between the white man\r\nwith all his physical and moral superiority and the negro, will ever\r\nthink of preferring the latter? The Americans of the Southern States\r\nhave two powerful passions which will always keep them aloof; the first\r\nis the fear of being assimilated to the negroes, their former slaves;\r\nand the second the dread of sinking below the whites, their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIf I were called upon to predict what will probably occur at some\r\nfuture time, I should say, that the abolition of slavery in the South\r\nwill, in the common course of things, increase the repugnance of the\r\nwhite population for the men of color. I found this opinion upon the\r\nanalogous observation which I already had occasion to make in the\r\nNorth. I there remarked that the white inhabitants of the North avoid\r\nthe negroes with increasing care, in proportion as the legal barriers\r\nof separation are removed by the legislature; and why should not the\r\nsame result take place in the South? In the North, the whites are\r\ndeterred from intermingling with the blacks by the fear of an imaginary\r\ndanger; in the South, where the danger would be real, I cannot imagine\r\nthat the fear would be less general.\r\n\r\nIf, on the one hand, it be admitted (and the fact is unquestionable)\r\nthat the colored population perpetually accumulates in the extreme\r\nSouth, and that it increases more rapidly than that of the whites; and\r\nif, on the other hand, it be allowed that it is impossible to foresee a\r\ntime at which the whites and the blacks will be so intermingled as to\r\nderive the same benefits from society; must it not be inferred that the\r\nblacks and the whites will, sooner or later, come to open strife in the\r\nSouthern States of the Union? But if it be asked what the issue of the\r\nstruggle is likely to be, it will readily be understood that we are\r\nhere left to form a very vague surmise of the truth. The human mind may\r\nsucceed in tracing a wide circle, as it were, which includes the course\r\nof future events; but within that circle a thousand various chances and\r\ncircumstances may direct it in as many different ways; and in every\r\npicture of the future there is a dim spot, which the eye of the\r\nunderstanding cannot penetrate. It appears, however, to be extremely\r\nprobable that in the West Indian Islands the white race is destined to\r\nbe subdued, and the black population to share the same fate upon the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn the West India Islands the white planters are surrounded by an\r\nimmense black population; on the continent, the blacks are placed\r\nbetween the ocean and an innumerable people, which already extends over\r\nthem in a dense mass, from the icy confines of Canada to the frontiers\r\nof Virginia, and from the banks of the Missouri to the shores of the\r\nAtlantic. If the white citizens of North America remain united, it\r\ncannot be supposed that the negroes will escape the destruction with\r\nwhich they are menaced; they must be subdued by want or by the sword.\r\nBut the black population which is accumulated along the coast of the\r\nGulf of Mexico, has a chance of success if the American Union is\r\ndissolved when the struggle between the two races begins. If the\r\nfederal tie were broken, the citizens of the South would be wrong to\r\nrely upon any lasting succor from their Northern countrymen. The latter\r\nare well aware that the danger can never reach them; and unless they\r\nare constrained to march to the assistance of the South by a positive\r\nobligation, it may be foreseen that the sympathy of color will be\r\ninsufficient to stimulate their exertions.\r\n\r\nYet, at whatever period the strife may break out, the whites of the\r\nSouth, even if they are abandoned to their own resources, will enter\r\nthe lists with an immense superiority of knowledge and of the means of\r\nwarfare; but the blacks will have numerical strength and the energy of\r\ndespair upon their side, and these are powerful resources to men who\r\nhave taken up arms. The fate of the white population of the Southern\r\nStates will, perhaps, be similar to that of the Moors in Spain. After\r\nhaving occupied the land for centuries, it will perhaps be forced to\r\nretire to the country whence its ancestors came, and to abandon to the\r\nnegroes the possession of a territory, which Providence seems to have\r\nmore peculiarly destined for them, since they can subsist and labor in\r\nit more easily that the whites.\r\n\r\nThe danger of a conflict between the white and the black inhabitants of\r\nthe Southern States of the Union\xe2\x80\x94a danger which, however remote it may\r\nbe, is inevitable\xe2\x80\x94perpetually haunts the imagination of the Americans.\r\nThe inhabitants of the North make it a common topic of conversation,\r\nalthough they have no direct injury to fear from the struggle; but they\r\nvainly endeavor to devise some means of obviating the misfortunes which\r\nthey foresee. In the Southern States the subject is not discussed: the\r\nplanter does not allude to the future in conversing with strangers; the\r\ncitizen does not communicate his apprehensions to his friends; he seeks\r\nto conceal them from himself; but there is something more alarming in\r\nthe tacit forebodings of the South, than in the clamorous fears of the\r\nNorthern States.\r\n\r\nThis all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an undertaking which\r\nis but little known, but which may have the effect of changing the fate\r\nof a portion of the human race. From apprehension of the dangers which\r\nI have just been describing, a certain number of American citizens have\r\nformed a society for the purpose of exporting to the coast of Guinea,\r\nat their own expense, such free negroes as may be willing to escape\r\nfrom the oppression to which they are subject. *t In 1820, the society\r\nto which I allude formed a settlement in Africa, upon the seventh\r\ndegree of north latitude, which bears the name of Liberia. The most\r\nrecent intelligence informs us that 2,500 negroes are collected there;\r\nthey have introduced the democratic institutions of America into the\r\ncountry of their forefathers; and Liberia has a representative system\r\nof government, negro jurymen, negro magistrates, and negro priests;\r\nchurches have been built, newspapers established, and, by a singular\r\nchange in the vicissitudes of the world, white men are prohibited from\r\nsojourning within the settlement. *u\r\n\r\nt\r\n[ This society assumed the name of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Society for the Colonization of\r\nthe Blacks.\xe2\x80\x9d See its annual reports; and more particularly the\r\nfifteenth. See also the pamphlet, to which allusion has already been\r\nmade, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cLetters on the Colonization Society, and on its\r\nprobable Results,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Carey, Philadelphia, 1833.]\r\n\r\n\r\nu\r\n[ This last regulation was laid down by the founders of the settlement;\r\nthey apprehended that a state of things might arise in Africa similar\r\nto that which exists on the frontiers of the United States, and that if\r\nthe negroes, like the Indians, were brought into collision with a\r\npeople more enlightened than themselves, they would be destroyed before\r\nthey could be civilized.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a strange caprice of fortune. Two hundred years have now\r\nelapsed since the inhabitants of Europe undertook to tear the negro\r\nfrom his family and his home, in order to transport him to the shores\r\nof North America; at the present day, the European settlers are engaged\r\nin sending back the descendants of those very negroes to the Continent\r\nfrom which they were originally taken; and the barbarous Africans have\r\nbeen brought into contact with civilization in the midst of bondage,\r\nand have become acquainted with free political institutions in slavery.\r\nUp to the present time Africa has been closed against the arts and\r\nsciences of the whites; but the inventions of Europe will perhaps\r\npenetrate into those regions, now that they are introduced by Africans\r\nthemselves. The settlement of Liberia is founded upon a lofty and a\r\nmost fruitful idea; but whatever may be its results with regard to the\r\nContinent of Africa, it can afford no remedy to the New World.\r\n\r\nIn twelve years the Colonization Society has transported 2,500 negroes\r\nto Africa; in the same space of time about 700,000 blacks were born in\r\nthe United States. If the colony of Liberia were so situated as to be\r\nable to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the\r\nnegroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union\r\nwere to supply the society with annual subsidies, *v and to transport\r\nthe negroes to Africa in the vessels of the State, it would still be\r\nunable to counterpoise the natural increase of population amongst the\r\nblacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born\r\nupon its territory within the same space of time, it would fail in\r\nsuspending the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the\r\nStates. *w The negro race will never leave those shores of the American\r\ncontinent, to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of\r\nEuropeans; and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it\r\ncontinues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may retard the\r\ncalamities which they apprehend, but they cannot now destroy their\r\nefficient cause.\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ Nor would these be the only difficulties attendant upon the\r\nundertaking; if the Union undertook to buy up the negroes now in\r\nAmerica, in order to transport them to Africa, the price of slaves,\r\nincreasing with their scarcity, would soon become enormous; and the\r\nStates of the North would never consent to expend such great sums for a\r\npurpose which would procure such small advantages to themselves. If the\r\nUnion took possession of the slaves in the Southern States by force, or\r\nat a rate determined by law, an insurmountable resistance would arise\r\nin that part of the country. Both alternatives are equally impossible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nw\r\n[ In 1830 there were in the United States 2,010,327 slaves and 319,439\r\nfree blacks, in all 2,329,766 negroes: which formed about one-fifth of\r\nthe total population of the United States at that time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am obliged to confess that I do not regard the abolition of slavery\r\nas a means of warding off the struggle of the two races in the United\r\nStates. The negroes may long remain slaves without complaining; but if\r\nthey are once raised to the level of free men, they will soon revolt at\r\nbeing deprived of all their civil rights; and as they cannot become the\r\nequals of the whites, they will speedily declare themselves as enemies.\r\nIn the North everything contributed to facilitate the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves; and slavery was abolished, without placing the free negroes\r\nin a position which could become formidable, since their number was too\r\nsmall for them ever to claim the exercise of their rights. But such is\r\nnot the case in the South. The question of slavery was a question of\r\ncommerce and manufacture for the slave-owners in the North; for those\r\nof the South, it is a question of life and death. God forbid that I\r\nshould seek to justify the principle of negro slavery, as has been done\r\nby some American writers! But I only observe that all the countries\r\nwhich formerly adopted that execrable principle are not equally able to\r\nabandon it at the present time.\r\n\r\nWhen I contemplate the condition of the South, I can only discover two\r\nalternatives which may be adopted by the white inhabitants of those\r\nStates; viz., either to emancipate the negroes, and to intermingle with\r\nthem; or, remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a state of\r\nslavery as long as possible. All intermediate measures seem to me\r\nlikely to terminate, and that shortly, in the most horrible of civil\r\nwars, and perhaps in the extirpation of one or other of the two races.\r\nSuch is the view which the Americans of the South take of the question,\r\nand they act consistently with it. As they are determined not to mingle\r\nwith the negroes, they refuse to emancipate them.\r\n\r\nNot that the inhabitants of the South regard slavery as necessary to\r\nthe wealth of the planter, for on this point many of them agree with\r\ntheir Northern countrymen in freely admitting that slavery is\r\nprejudicial to their interest; but they are convinced that, however\r\nprejudicial it may be, they hold their lives upon no other tenure. The\r\ninstruction which is now diffused in the South has convinced the\r\ninhabitants that slavery is injurious to the slave-owner, but it has\r\nalso shown them, more clearly than before, that no means exist of\r\ngetting rid of its bad consequences. Hence arises a singular contrast;\r\nthe more the utility of slavery is contested, the more firmly is it\r\nestablished in the laws; and whilst the principle of servitude is\r\ngradually abolished in the North, that self-same principle gives rise\r\nto more and more rigorous consequences in the South.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the Southern States with regard to slaves, presents\r\nat the present day such unparalleled atrocities as suffice to show how\r\nradically the laws of humanity have been perverted, and to betray the\r\ndesperate position of the community in which that legislation has been\r\npromulgated. The Americans of this portion of the Union have not,\r\nindeed, augmented the hardships of slavery; they have, on the contrary,\r\nbettered the physical condition of the slaves. The only means by which\r\nthe ancients maintained slavery were fetters and death; the Americans\r\nof the South of the Union have discovered more intellectual securities\r\nfor the duration of their power. They have employed their despotism and\r\ntheir violence against the human mind. In antiquity, precautions were\r\ntaken to prevent the slave from breaking his chains; at the present day\r\nmeasures are adopted to deprive him even of the desire of freedom. The\r\nancients kept the bodies of their slaves in bondage, but they placed no\r\nrestraint upon the mind and no check upon education; and they acted\r\nconsistently with their established principle, since a natural\r\ntermination of slavery then existed, and one day or other the slave\r\nmight be set free, and become the equal of his master. But the\r\nAmericans of the South, who do not admit that the negroes can ever be\r\ncommingled with themselves, have forbidden them to be taught to read or\r\nto write, under severe penalties; and as they will not raise them to\r\ntheir own level, they sink them as nearly as possible to that of the\r\nbrutes.\r\n\r\nThe hope of liberty had always been allowed to the slave to cheer the\r\nhardships of his condition. But the Americans of the South are well\r\naware that emancipation cannot but be dangerous, when the freed man can\r\nnever be assimilated to his former master. To give a man his freedom,\r\nand to leave him in wretchedness and ignominy, is nothing less than to\r\nprepare a future chief for a revolt of the slaves. Moreover, it has\r\nlong been remarked that the presence of a free negro vaguely agitates\r\nthe minds of his less fortunate brethren, and conveys to them a dim\r\nnotion of their rights. The Americans of the South have consequently\r\ntaken measures to prevent slave-owners from emancipating their slaves\r\nin most cases; not indeed by a positive prohibition, but by subjecting\r\nthat step to various forms which it is difficult to comply with. I\r\nhappened to meet with an old man, in the South of the Union, who had\r\nlived in illicit intercourse with one of his negresses, and had had\r\nseveral children by her, who were born the slaves of their father. He\r\nhad indeed frequently thought of bequeathing to them at least their\r\nliberty; but years had elapsed without his being able to surmount the\r\nlegal obstacles to their emancipation, and in the mean while his old\r\nage was come, and he was about to die. He pictured to himself his sons\r\ndragged from market to market, and passing from the authority of a\r\nparent to the rod of the stranger, until these horrid anticipations\r\nworked his expiring imagination into frenzy. When I saw him he was a\r\nprey to all the anguish of despair, and he made me feel how awful is\r\nthe retribution of nature upon those who have broken her laws.\r\n\r\nThese evils are unquestionably great; but they are the necessary and\r\nforeseen consequence of the very principle of modern slavery. When the\r\nEuropeans chose their slaves from a race differing from their own,\r\nwhich many of them considered as inferior to the other races of\r\nmankind, and which they all repelled with horror from any notion of\r\nintimate connection, they must have believed that slavery would last\r\nforever; since there is no intermediate state which can be durable\r\nbetween the excessive inequality produced by servitude and the complete\r\nequality which originates in independence. The Europeans did\r\nimperfectly feel this truth, but without acknowledging it even to\r\nthemselves. Whenever they have had to do with negroes, their conduct\r\nhas either been dictated by their interest and their pride, or by their\r\ncompassion. They first violated every right of humanity by their\r\ntreatment of the negro and they afterwards informed him that those\r\nrights were precious and inviolable. They affected to open their ranks\r\nto the slaves, but the negroes who attempted to penetrate into the\r\ncommunity were driven back with scorn; and they have incautiously and\r\ninvoluntarily been led to admit of freedom instead of slavery, without\r\nhaving the courage to be wholly iniquitous, or wholly just.\r\n\r\nIf it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the Americans of\r\nthe South will mingle their blood with that of the negroes, can they\r\nallow their slaves to become free without compromising their own\r\nsecurity? And if they are obliged to keep that race in bondage in order\r\nto save their own families, may they not be excused for availing\r\nthemselves of the means best adapted to that end? The events which are\r\ntaking place in the Southern States of the Union appear to me to be at\r\nonce the most horrible and the most natural results of slavery. When I\r\nsee the order of nature overthrown, and when I hear the cry of humanity\r\nin its vain struggle against the laws, my indignation does not light\r\nupon the men of our own time who are the instruments of these outrages;\r\nbut I reserve my execration for those who, after a thousand years of\r\nfreedom, brought back slavery into the world once more.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the efforts of the Americans of the South to maintain\r\nslavery, they will not always succeed. Slavery, which is now confined\r\nto a single tract of the civilized earth, which is attacked by\r\nChristianity as unjust, and by political economy as prejudicial; and\r\nwhich is now contrasted with democratic liberties and the information\r\nof our age, cannot survive. By the choice of the master, or by the will\r\nof the slave, it will cease; and in either case great calamities may be\r\nexpected to ensue. If liberty be refused to the negroes of the South,\r\nthey will in the end seize it for themselves by force; if it be given,\r\nthey will abuse it ere long. *x\r\n\r\nx\r\n[ [This chapter is no longer applicable to the condition of the negro\r\nrace in the United States, since the abolition of slavery was the\r\nresult, though not the object, of the great Civil War, and the negroes\r\nhave been raised to the condition not only of freedmen, but of\r\ncitizens; and in some States they exercise a preponderating political\r\npower by reason of their numerical majority. Thus, in South Carolina\r\nthere were in 1870, 289,667 whites and 415,814 blacks. But the\r\nemancipation of the slaves has not solved the problem, how two races so\r\ndifferent and so hostile are to live together in peace in one country\r\non equal terms.

But it must be confessed that\r\nthe sagacity of the author is sometimes at fault in these speculations,\r\nand did not save him from considerable errors, which the course of\r\nevents has since made apparent. He held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe legislators of the\r\nConstitution of 1789 were not appointed to constitute the government of\r\na single people, but to regulate the association of several States;\r\nthat the Union was formed by the voluntary agreement of the States, and\r\nin uniting together they have not forfeited their nationality, nor have\r\nthey been reduced to the condition of one and the same people.\xe2\x80\x9d Whence\r\nhe inferred that \xe2\x80\x9cif one of the States chose to withdraw its name from\r\nthe contract, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so;\r\nand that the Federal Government would have no means of maintaining its\r\nclaims directly, either by force or by right.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the Southern\r\ntheory of the Constitution, and the whole case of the South in favor of\r\nsecession. To many Europeans, and to some American (Northern) jurists,\r\nthis view appeared to be sound; but it was vigorously resisted by the\r\nNorth, and crushed by force of arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of this book was mistaken in supposing that the \xe2\x80\x9cUnion was a\r\nvast body which presents no definite object to patriotic feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d When\r\nthe day of trial came, millions of men were ready to lay down their\r\nlives for it. He was also mistaken in supposing that the Federal\r\nExecutive is so weak that it requires the free consent of the governed\r\nto enable it to subsist, and that it would be defeated in a struggle to\r\nmaintain the Union against one or more separate States. In 1861 nine\r\nStates, with a population of 8,753,000, seceded, and maintained for\r\nfour years a resolute but unequal contest for independence, but they\r\nwere defeated.\r\n\r\nLastly, the author was mistaken in supposing that a community of\r\ninterests would always prevail between North and South sufficiently\r\npowerful to bind them together. He overlooked the influence which the\r\nquestion of slavery must have on the Union the moment that the majority\r\nof the people of the North declared against it. In 1831, when the\r\nauthor visited America, the anti-slavery agitation had scarcely begun;\r\nand the fact of Southern slavery was accepted by men of all parties,\r\neven in the States where there were no slaves: and that was\r\nunquestionably the view taken by all the States and by all American\r\nstatesmen at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, in 1789. But\r\nin the course of thirty years a great change took place, and the North\r\nrefused to perpetuate what had become the \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar institution\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nSouth, especially as it gave the South a species of aristocratic\r\npreponderance. The result was the ratification, in December, 1865, of\r\nthe celebrated 13th article or amendment of the Constitution, which\r\ndeclared that \xe2\x80\x9cneither slavery nor involuntary servitude\xe2\x80\x94except as a\r\npunishment for crime\xe2\x80\x94shall exist within the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d To which\r\nwas soon afterwards added the 15th article, \xe2\x80\x9cThe right of citizens to\r\nvote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any\r\nState, on account of race, color, or previous servitude.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nemancipation of several millions of negro slaves without compensation,\r\nand the transfer to them of political preponderance in the States in\r\nwhich they outnumber the white population, were acts of the North\r\ntotally opposed to the interests of the South, and which could only\r\nhave been carried into effect by conquest.\xe2\x80\x94Translator\xe2\x80\x99s Note.]]\r\n\r\nReason for which the preponderating force lies in the States rather\r\nthan in the Union\xe2\x80\x94The Union will only last as long as all the States\r\nchoose to belong to it\xe2\x80\x94Causes which tend to keep them united\xe2\x80\x94Utility of\r\nthe Union to resist foreign enemies, and to prevent the existence of\r\nforeigners in America\xe2\x80\x94No natural barriers between the several States\xe2\x80\x94No\r\nconflicting interests to divide them\xe2\x80\x94Reciprocal interests of the\r\nNorthern, Southern, and Western States\xe2\x80\x94Intellectual ties of\r\nunion\xe2\x80\x94Uniformity of opinions\xe2\x80\x94Dangers of the Union resulting from the\r\ndifferent characters and the passions of its citizens\xe2\x80\x94Character of the\r\ncitizens in the South and in the North\xe2\x80\x94The rapid growth of the Union\r\none of its greatest dangers\xe2\x80\x94Progress of the population to the\r\nNorthwest\xe2\x80\x94Power gravitates in the same direction\xe2\x80\x94Passions originating\r\nfrom sudden turns of fortune\xe2\x80\x94Whether the existing Government of the\r\nUnion tends to gain strength, or to lose it\xe2\x80\x94Various signs of its\r\ndecrease\xe2\x80\x94Internal improvements\xe2\x80\x94Waste lands\xe2\x80\x94Indians\xe2\x80\x94The Bank\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nTariff\xe2\x80\x94General Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the existing institutions of the several States\r\ndepends in some measure upon the maintenance of the Union itself. It is\r\ntherefore important in the first instance to inquire into the probable\r\nfate of the Union. One point may indeed be assumed at once: if the\r\npresent confederation were dissolved, it appears to me to be\r\nincontestable that the States of which it is now composed would not\r\nreturn to their original isolated condition, but that several unions\r\nwould then be formed in the place of one. It is not my intention to\r\ninquire into the principles upon which these new unions would probably\r\nbe established, but merely to show what the causes are which may effect\r\nthe dismemberment of the existing confederation.\r\n\r\nWith this object I shall be obliged to retrace some of the steps which\r\nI have already taken, and to revert to topics which I have before\r\ndiscussed. I am aware that the reader may accuse me of repetition, but\r\nthe importance of the matter which still remains to be treated is my\r\nexcuse; I had rather say too much, than say too little to be thoroughly\r\nunderstood, and I prefer injuring the author to slighting the subject.\r\n\r\nThe legislators who formed the Constitution of 1789 endeavored to\r\nconfer a distinct and preponderating authority upon the federal power.\r\nBut they were confined by the conditions of the task which they had\r\nundertaken to perform. They were not appointed to constitute the\r\ngovernment of a single people, but to regulate the association of\r\nseveral States; and, whatever their inclinations might be, they could\r\nnot but divide the exercise of sovereignty in the end.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the consequences of this division, it is\r\nnecessary to make a short distinction between the affairs of the\r\nGovernment. There are some objects which are national by their very\r\nnature, that is to say, which affect the nation as a body, and can only\r\nbe intrusted to the man or the assembly of men who most completely\r\nrepresent the entire nation. Amongst these may be reckoned war and\r\ndiplomacy. There are other objects which are provincial by their very\r\nnature, that is to say, which only affect certain localities, and which\r\ncan only be properly treated in that locality. Such, for instance, is\r\nthe budget of a municipality. Lastly, there are certain objects of a\r\nmixed nature, which are national inasmuch as they affect all the\r\ncitizens who compose the nation, and which are provincial inasmuch as\r\nit is not necessary that the nation itself should provide for them all.\r\nSuch are the rights which regulate the civil and political condition of\r\nthe citizens. No society can exist without civil and political rights.\r\nThese rights therefore interest all the citizens alike; but it is not\r\nalways necessary to the existence and the prosperity of the nation that\r\nthese rights should be uniform, nor, consequently, that they should be\r\nregulated by the central authority.\r\n\r\nThere are, then, two distinct categories of objects which are submitted\r\nto the direction of the sovereign power; and these categories occur in\r\nall well-constituted communities, whatever the basis of the political\r\nconstitution may otherwise be. Between these two extremes the objects\r\nwhich I have termed mixed may be considered to lie. As these objects\r\nare neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, they may be\r\nobtained by a national or by a provincial government, according to the\r\nagreement of the contracting parties, without in any way impairing the\r\ncontract of association.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign power is usually formed by the union of separate\r\nindividuals, who compose a people; and individual powers or collective\r\nforces, each representing a very small portion of the sovereign\r\nauthority, are the sole elements which are subjected to the general\r\nGovernment of their choice. In this case the general Government is more\r\nnaturally called upon to regulate, not only those affairs which are of\r\nessential national importance, but those which are of a more local\r\ninterest; and the local governments are reduced to that small share of\r\nsovereign authority which is indispensable to their prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the sovereign authority is composed of preorganized\r\npolitical bodies, by virtue of circumstances anterior to their union;\r\nand in this case the provincial governments assume the control, not\r\nonly of those affairs which more peculiarly belong to their province,\r\nbut of all, or of a part of the mixed affairs to which allusion has\r\nbeen made. For the confederate nations which were independent sovereign\r\nStates before their union, and which still represent a very\r\nconsiderable share of the sovereign power, have only consented to cede\r\nto the general Government the exercise of those rights which are\r\nindispensable to the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen the national Government, independently of the prerogatives\r\ninherent in its nature, is invested with the right of regulating the\r\naffairs which relate partly to the general and partly to the local\r\ninterests, it possesses a preponderating influence. Not only are its\r\nown rights extensive, but all the rights which it does not possess\r\nexist by its sufferance, and it may be apprehended that the provincial\r\ngovernments may be deprived of their natural and necessary prerogatives\r\nby its influence.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, the provincial governments are invested with\r\nthe power of regulating those same affairs of mixed interest, an\r\nopposite tendency prevails in society. The preponderating force resides\r\nin the province, not in the nation; and it may be apprehended that the\r\nnational Government may in the end be stripped of the privileges which\r\nare necessary to its existence.\r\n\r\nIndependent nations have therefore a natural tendency to\r\ncentralization, and confederations to dismemberment.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for us to apply these general principles to the\r\nAmerican Union. The several States were necessarily possessed of the\r\nright of regulating all exclusively provincial affairs. Moreover these\r\nsame States retained the rights of determining the civil and political\r\ncompetency of the citizens, or regulating the reciprocal relations of\r\nthe members of the community, and of dispensing justice; rights which\r\nare of a general nature, but which do not necessarily appertain to the\r\nnational Government. We have shown that the Government of the Union is\r\ninvested with the power of acting in the name of the whole nation in\r\nthose cases in which the nation has to appear as a single and undivided\r\npower; as, for instance, in foreign relations, and in offering a common\r\nresistance to a common enemy; in short, in conducting those affairs\r\nwhich I have styled exclusively national.\r\n\r\nIn this division of the rights of sovereignty, the share of the Union\r\nseems at first sight to be more considerable than that of the States;\r\nbut a more attentive investigation shows it to be less so. The\r\nundertakings of the Government of the Union are more vast, but their\r\ninfluence is more rarely felt. Those of the provincial governments are\r\ncomparatively small, but they are incessant, and they serve to keep\r\nalive the authority which they represent. The Government of the Union\r\nwatches the general interests of the country; but the general interests\r\nof a people have a very questionable influence upon individual\r\nhappiness, whilst provincial interests produce a most immediate effect\r\nupon the welfare of the inhabitants. The Union secures the independence\r\nand the greatness of the nation, which do not immediately affect\r\nprivate citizens; but the several States maintain the liberty, regulate\r\nthe rights, protect the fortune, and secure the life and the whole\r\nfuture prosperity of every citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government is very far removed from its subjects, whilst\r\nthe provincial governments are within the reach of them all, and are\r\nready to attend to the smallest appeal. The central Government has upon\r\nits side the passions of a few superior men who aspire to conduct it;\r\nbut upon the side of the provincial governments are the interests of\r\nall those second-rate individuals who can only hope to obtain power\r\nwithin their own State, and who nevertheless exercise the largest share\r\nof authority over the people because they are placed nearest to its\r\nlevel. The Americans have therefore much more to hope and to fear from\r\nthe States than from the Union; and, in conformity with the natural\r\ntendency of the human mind, they are more likely to attach themselves\r\nto the former than to the latter. In this respect their habits and\r\nfeelings harmonize with their interests.\r\n\r\nWhen a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a confederate\r\nform of government, the traditions, the customs, and the manners of the\r\npeople are for a long time at variance with their legislation; and the\r\nformer tend to give a degree of influence to the central government\r\nwhich the latter forbids. When a number of confederate states unite to\r\nform a single nation, the same causes operate in an opposite direction.\r\nI have no doubt that if France were to become a confederate republic\r\nlike that of the United States, the government would at first display\r\nmore energy than that of the Union; and if the Union were to alter its\r\nconstitution to a monarchy like that of France, I think that the\r\nAmerican Government would be a long time in acquiring the force which\r\nnow rules the latter nation. When the national existence of the\r\nAnglo-Americans began, their provincial existence was already of long\r\nstanding; necessary relations were established between the townships\r\nand the individual citizens of the same States; and they were\r\naccustomed to consider some objects as common to them all, and to\r\nconduct other affairs as exclusively relating to their own special\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe Union is a vast body which presents no definite object to patriotic\r\nfeeling. The forms and limits of the State are distinct and\r\ncircumscribed; since it represents a certain number of objects which\r\nare familiar to the citizens and beloved by all. It is identified with\r\nthe very soil, with the right of property and the domestic affections,\r\nwith the recollections of the past, the labors of the present, and the\r\nhopes of the future. Patriotism, then, which is frequently a mere\r\nextension of individual egotism, is still directed to the State, and is\r\nnot excited by the Union. Thus the tendency of the interests, the\r\nhabits, and the feelings of the people is to centre political activity\r\nin the States, in preference to the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to estimate the different forces of the two governments, by\r\nremarking the manner in which they fulfil their respective functions.\r\nWhenever the government of a State has occasion to address an\r\nindividual or an assembly of individuals, its language is clear and\r\nimperative; and such is also the tone of the Federal Government in its\r\nintercourse with individuals, but no sooner has it anything to do with\r\na State than it begins to parley, to explain its motives and to justify\r\nits conduct, to argue, to advise, and, in short, anything but to\r\ncommand. If doubts are raised as to the limits of the constitutional\r\npowers of each government, the provincial government prefers its claim\r\nwith boldness, and takes prompt and energetic steps to support it. In\r\nthe mean while the Government of the Union reasons; it appeals to the\r\ninterests, to the good sense, to the glory of the nation; it\r\ntemporizes, it negotiates, and does not consent to act until it is\r\nreduced to the last extremity. At first sight it might readily be\r\nimagined that it is the provincial government which is armed with the\r\nauthority of the nation, and that Congress represents a single State.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government is, therefore, notwithstanding the precautions\r\nof those who founded it, naturally so weak that it more peculiarly\r\nrequires the free consent of the governed to enable it to subsist. It\r\nis easy to perceive that its object is to enable the States to realize\r\nwith facility their determination of remaining united; and, as long as\r\nthis preliminary condition exists, its authority is great, temperate,\r\nand effective. The Constitution fits the Government to control\r\nindividuals, and easily to surmount such obstacles as they may be\r\ninclined to offer; but it was by no means established with a view to\r\nthe possible separation of one or more of the States from the Union.\r\n\r\nIf the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle with that\r\nof the States at the present day, its defeat may be confidently\r\npredicted; and it is not probable that such a struggle would be\r\nseriously undertaken. As often as a steady resistance is offered to the\r\nFederal Government it will be found to yield. Experience has hitherto\r\nshown that whenever a State has demanded anything with perseverance and\r\nresolution, it has invariably succeeded; and that if a separate\r\ngovernment has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do as it\r\nthought fit. *z\r\n\r\nz\r\n[ See the conduct of the Northern States in the war of 1812. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring\r\nthat war,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jefferson in a letter to General Lafayette, \xe2\x80\x9cfour of\r\nthe Eastern States were only attached to the Union, like so many\r\ninanimate bodies to living men.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even if the Government of the Union had any strength inherent in\r\nitself, the physical situation of the country would render the exercise\r\nof that strength very difficult. *a The United States cover an immense\r\nterritory; they are separated from each other by great distances; and\r\nthe population is disseminated over the surface of a country which is\r\nstill half a wilderness. If the Union were to undertake to enforce the\r\nallegiance of the confederate States by military means, it would be in\r\na position very analogous to that of England at the time of the War of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ The profound peace of the Union affords no pretext for a standing\r\narmy; and without a standing army a government is not prepared to\r\nprofit by a favorable opportunity to conquer resistance, and take the\r\nsovereign power by surprise. [This note, and the paragraph in the text\r\nwhich precedes, have been shown by the results of the Civil War to be a\r\nmisconception of the writer.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever strong a government may be, it cannot easily escape from the\r\nconsequences of a principle which it has once admitted as the\r\nfoundation of its constitution. The Union was formed by the voluntary\r\nagreement of the States; and, in uniting together, they have not\r\nforfeited their nationality, nor have they been reduced to the\r\ncondition of one and the same people. If one of the States chose to\r\nwithdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove\r\nits right of doing so; and the Federal Government would have no means\r\nof maintaining its claims directly, either by force or by right. In\r\norder to enable the Federal Government easily to conquer the resistance\r\nwhich may be offered to it by any one of its subjects, it would be\r\nnecessary that one or more of them should be specially interested in\r\nthe existence of the Union, as has frequently been the case in the\r\nhistory of confederations.\r\n\r\nIf it be supposed that amongst the States which are united by the\r\nfederal tie there are some which exclusively enjoy the principal\r\nadvantages of union, or whose prosperity depends on the duration of\r\nthat union, it is unquestionable that they will always be ready to\r\nsupport the central Government in enforcing the obedience of the\r\nothers. But the Government would then be exerting a force not derived\r\nfrom itself, but from a principle contrary to its nature. States form\r\nconfederations in order to derive equal advantages from their union;\r\nand in the case just alluded to, the Federal Government would derive\r\nits power from the unequal distribution of those benefits amongst the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIf one of the confederate States have acquired a preponderance\r\nsufficiently great to enable it to take exclusive possession of the\r\ncentral authority, it will consider the other States as subject\r\nprovinces, and it will cause its own supremacy to be respected under\r\nthe borrowed name of the sovereignty of the Union. Great things may\r\nthen be done in the name of the Federal Government, but in reality that\r\nGovernment will have ceased to exist. *b In both these cases, the power\r\nwhich acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger the more\r\nit abandons the natural state and the acknowledged principles of\r\nconfederations.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ Thus the province of Holland in the republic of the Low Countries,\r\nand the Emperor in the Germanic Confederation, have sometimes put\r\nthemselves in the place of the union, and have employed the federal\r\nauthority to their own advantage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America the existing Union is advantageous to all the States, but it\r\nis not indispensable to any one of them. Several of them might break\r\nthe federal tie without compromising the welfare of the others,\r\nalthough their own prosperity would be lessened. As the existence and\r\nthe happiness of none of the States are wholly dependent on the present\r\nConstitution, they would none of them be disposed to make great\r\npersonal sacrifices to maintain it. On the other hand, there is no\r\nState which seems hitherto to have its ambition much interested in the\r\nmaintenance of the existing Union. They certainly do not all exercise\r\nthe same influence in the federal councils, but no one of them can hope\r\nto domineer over the rest, or to treat them as its inferiors or as its\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me unquestionable that if any portion of the Union\r\nseriously desired to separate itself from the other States, they would\r\nnot be able, nor indeed would they attempt, to prevent it; and that the\r\npresent Union will only last as long as the States which compose it\r\nchoose to continue members of the confederation. If this point be\r\nadmitted, the question becomes less difficult; and our object is, not\r\nto inquire whether the States of the existing Union are capable of\r\nseparating, but whether they will choose to remain united.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various reasons which tend to render the existing Union\r\nuseful to the Americans, two principal causes are peculiarly evident to\r\nthe observer. Although the Americans are, as it were, alone upon their\r\ncontinent, their commerce makes them the neighbors of all the nations\r\nwith which they trade. Notwithstanding their apparent isolation, the\r\nAmericans require a certain degree of strength, which they cannot\r\nretain otherwise than by remaining united to each other. If the States\r\nwere to split, they would not only diminish the strength which they are\r\nnow able to display towards foreign nations, but they would soon create\r\nforeign powers upon their own territory. A system of inland\r\ncustom-houses would then be established; the valleys would be divided\r\nby imaginary boundary lines; the courses of the rivers would be\r\nconfined by territorial distinctions; and a multitude of hindrances\r\nwould prevent the Americans from exploring the whole of that vast\r\ncontinent which Providence has allotted to them for a dominion. At\r\npresent they have no invasion to fear, and consequently no standing\r\narmies to maintain, no taxes to levy. If the Union were dissolved, all\r\nthese burdensome measures might ere long be required. The Americans are\r\nthen very powerfully interested in the maintenance of their Union. On\r\nthe other hand, it is almost impossible to discover any sort of\r\nmaterial interest which might at present tempt a portion of the Union\r\nto separate from the other States.\r\n\r\nWhen we cast our eyes upon the map of the United States, we perceive\r\nthe chain of the Alleghany Mountains, running from the northeast to the\r\nsouthwest, and crossing nearly one thousand miles of country; and we\r\nare led to imagine that the design of Providence was to raise between\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi and the coast of the Atlantic Ocean one\r\nof those natural barriers which break the mutual intercourse of men,\r\nand form the necessary limits of different States. But the average\r\nheight of the Alleghanies does not exceed 2,500 feet; their greatest\r\nelevation is not above 4,000 feet; their rounded summits, and the\r\nspacious valleys which they conceal within their passes, are of easy\r\naccess from several sides. Besides which, the principal rivers which\r\nfall into the Atlantic Ocean\xe2\x80\x94the Hudson, the Susquehanna, and the\r\nPotomac\xe2\x80\x94take their rise beyond the Alleghanies, in an open district,\r\nwhich borders upon the valley of the Mississippi. These streams quit\r\nthis tract of country, make their way through the barrier which would\r\nseem to turn them westward, and as they wind through the mountains they\r\nopen an easy and natural passage to man. No natural barrier exists in\r\nthe regions which are now inhabited by the Anglo-Americans; the\r\nAlleghanies are so far from serving as a boundary to separate nations,\r\nthat they do not even serve as a frontier to the States. New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Virginia comprise them within their borders, and they\r\nextend as much to the west as to the east of the line. The territory\r\nnow occupied by the twenty-four States of the Union, and the three\r\ngreat districts which have not yet acquired the rank of States,\r\nalthough they already contain inhabitants, covers a surface of\r\n1,002,600 square miles, *c which is about equal to five times the\r\nextent of France. Within these limits the qualities of the soil, the\r\ntemperature, and the produce of the country, are extremely various. The\r\nvast extent of territory occupied by the Anglo-American republics has\r\ngiven rise to doubts as to the maintenance of their Union. Here a\r\ndistinction must be made; contrary interests sometimes arise in the\r\ndifferent provinces of a vast empire, which often terminate in open\r\ndissensions; and the extent of the country is then most prejudicial to\r\nthe power of the State. But if the inhabitants of these vast regions\r\nare not divided by contrary interests, the extent of the territory may\r\nbe favorable to their prosperity; for the unity of the government\r\npromotes the interchange of the different productions of the soil, and\r\nincreases their value by facilitating their consumption.\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cDarby\xe2\x80\x99s View of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 435.

The Southern States are almost exclusively agricultural.\r\nThe Northern States are more peculiarly commercial and manufacturing.\r\nThe States of the West are at the same time agricultural and\r\nmanufacturing. In the South the crops consist of tobacco, of rice, of\r\ncotton, and of sugar; in the North and the West, of wheat and maize.\r\nThese are different sources of wealth; but union is the means by which\r\nthese sources are opened to all, and rendered equally advantageous to\r\nthe several districts.\r\n\r\nThe North, which ships the produce of the Anglo-Americans to all parts\r\nof the world, and brings back the produce of the globe to the Union, is\r\nevidently interested in maintaining the confederation in its present\r\ncondition, in order that the number of American producers and consumers\r\nmay remain as large as possible. The North is the most natural agent of\r\ncommunication between the South and the West of the Union on the one\r\nhand, and the rest of the world upon the other; the North is therefore\r\ninterested in the union and prosperity of the South and the West, in\r\norder that they may continue to furnish raw materials for its\r\nmanufactures, and cargoes for its shipping.\r\n\r\nThe South and the West, on their side, are still more directly\r\ninterested in the preservation of the Union, and the prosperity of the\r\nNorth. The produce of the South is, for the most part, exported beyond\r\nseas; the South and the West consequently stand in need of the\r\ncommercial resources of the North. They are likewise interested in the\r\nmaintenance of a powerful fleet by the Union, to protect them\r\nefficaciously. The South and the West have no vessels, but they cannot\r\nrefuse a willing subsidy to defray the expenses of the navy; for if the\r\nfleets of Europe were to blockade the ports of the South and the delta\r\nof the Mississippi, what would become of the rice of the Carolinas, the\r\ntobacco of Virginia, and the sugar and cotton which grow in the valley\r\nof the Mississippi? Every portion of the federal budget does therefore\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of material interests which are common to\r\nall the confederate States.\r\n\r\nIndependently of this commercial utility, the South and the West of the\r\nUnion derive great political advantages from their connection with the\r\nNorth. The South contains an enormous slave population; a population\r\nwhich is already alarming, and still more formidable for the future.\r\nThe States of the West lie in the remotest parts of a single valley;\r\nand all the rivers which intersect their territory rise in the Rocky\r\nMountains or in the Alleghanies, and fall into the Mississippi, which\r\nbears them onwards to the Gulf of Mexico. The Western States are\r\nconsequently entirely cut off, by their position, from the traditions\r\nof Europe and the civilization of the Old World. The inhabitants of the\r\nSouth, then, are induced to support the Union in order to avail\r\nthemselves of its protection against the blacks; and the inhabitants of\r\nthe West in order not to be excluded from a free communication with the\r\nrest of the globe, and shut up in the wilds of central America. The\r\nNorth cannot but desire the maintenance of the Union, in order to\r\nremain, as it now is, the connecting link between that vast body and\r\nthe other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe temporal interests of all the several parts of the Union are, then,\r\nintimately connected; and the same assertion holds true respecting\r\nthose opinions and sentiments which may be termed the immaterial\r\ninterests of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their\r\nattachment to their country; but I confess that I do not rely upon that\r\ncalculating patriotism which is founded upon interest, and which a\r\nchange in the interests at stake may obliterate. Nor do I attach much\r\nimportance to the language of the Americans, when they manifest, in\r\ntheir daily conversations, the intention of maintaining the federal\r\nsystem adopted by their forefathers. A government retains its sway over\r\na great number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and rational\r\nconsent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to a certain\r\nextent involuntary agreement, which results from similarity of feelings\r\nand resemblances of opinion. I will never admit that men constitute a\r\nsocial body, simply because they obey the same head and the same laws.\r\nSociety can only exist when a great number of men consider a great\r\nnumber of things in the same point of view; when they hold the same\r\nopinions upon many subjects, and when the same occurrences suggest the\r\nsame thoughts and impressions to their minds.\r\n\r\nThe observer who examines the present condition of the United States\r\nupon this principle, will readily discover, that although the citizens\r\nare divided into twenty-four distinct sovereignties, they nevertheless\r\nconstitute a single people; and he may perhaps be led to think that the\r\nstate of the Anglo-American Union is more truly a state of society than\r\nthat of certain nations of Europe which live under the same legislation\r\nand the same prince.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects, they all\r\nregard religion in the same manner. They are not always agreed upon the\r\nmeasures which are most conducive to good government, and they vary\r\nupon some of the forms of government which it is expedient to adopt;\r\nbut they are unanimous upon the general principles which ought to rule\r\nhuman society. From Maine to the Floridas, and from the Missouri to the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, the people is held to be the legitimate source of all\r\npower. The same notions are entertained respecting liberty and\r\nequality, the liberty of the press, the right of association, the jury,\r\nand the responsibility of the agents of Government.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from their political and religious opinions to the moral and\r\nphilosophical principles which regulate the daily actions of life and\r\ngovern their conduct, we shall still find the same uniformity. The\r\nAnglo-Americans *d acknowledge the absolute moral authority of the\r\nreason of the community, as they acknowledge the political authority of\r\nthe mass of citizens; and they hold that public opinion is the surest\r\narbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false. The majority of\r\nthem believe that a man will be led to do what is just and good by\r\nfollowing his own interest rightly understood. They hold that every man\r\nis born in possession of the right of self-government, and that no one\r\nhas the right of constraining his fellow-creatures to be happy. They\r\nhave all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man; they are of\r\nopinion that the effects of the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily\r\nbe advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all\r\nconsider society as a body in a state of improvement, humanity as a\r\nchanging scene, in which nothing is, or ought to be, permanent; and\r\nthey admit that what appears to them to be good to-day may be\r\nsuperseded by something better-to-morrow. I do not give all these\r\nopinions as true, but I quote them as characteristic of the Americans.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the expression\r\nAnglo-Americans, I only mean to designate the great majority of the\r\nnation; for a certain number of isolated individuals are of course to\r\nbe met with holding very different opinions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans are not only united together by these common\r\nopinions, but they are separated from all other nations by a common\r\nfeeling of pride. For the last fifty years no pains have been spared to\r\nconvince the inhabitants of the United States that they constitute the\r\nonly religious, enlightened, and free people. They perceive that, for\r\nthe present, their own democratic institutions succeed, whilst those of\r\nother countries fail; hence they conceive an overweening opinion of\r\ntheir superiority, and they are not very remote from believing\r\nthemselves to belong to a distinct race of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe dangers which threaten the American Union do not originate in the\r\ndiversity of interests or of opinions, but in the various characters\r\nand passions of the Americans. The men who inhabit the vast territory\r\nof the United States are almost all the issue of a common stock; but\r\nthe effects of the climate, and more especially of slavery, have\r\ngradually introduced very striking differences between the British\r\nsettler of the Southern States and the British settler of the North. In\r\nEurope it is generally believed that slavery has rendered the interests\r\nof one part of the Union contrary to those of another part; but I by no\r\nmeans remarked this to be the case: slavery has not created interests\r\nin the South contrary to those of the North, but it has modified the\r\ncharacter and changed the habits of the natives of the South.\r\n\r\nI have already explained the influence which slavery has exercised upon\r\nthe commercial ability of the Americans in the South; and this same\r\ninfluence equally extends to their manners. The slave is a servant who\r\nnever remonstrates, and who submits to everything without complaint. He\r\nmay sometimes assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. In the\r\nSouth there are no families so poor as not to have slaves. The citizen\r\nof the Southern States of the Union is invested with a sort of domestic\r\ndictatorship, from his earliest years; the first notion he acquires in\r\nlife is that he is born to command, and the first habit which he\r\ncontracts is that of being obeyed without resistance. His education\r\ntends, then, to give him the character of a supercilious and a hasty\r\nman; irascible, violent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of\r\nobstacles, but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nThe American of the Northern States is surrounded by no slaves in his\r\nchildhood; he is even unattended by free servants, and is usually\r\nobliged to provide for his own wants. No sooner does he enter the world\r\nthan the idea of necessity assails him on every side: he soon learns to\r\nknow exactly the natural limit of his authority; he never expects to\r\nsubdue those who withstand him, by force; and he knows that the surest\r\nmeans of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures, is to win their\r\nfavor. He therefore becomes patient, reflecting, tolerant, slow to act,\r\nand persevering in his designs.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States the more immediate wants of life are always\r\nsupplied; the inhabitants of those parts are not busied in the material\r\ncares of life, which are always provided for by others; and their\r\nimagination is diverted to more captivating and less definite objects.\r\nThe American of the South is fond of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of\r\ngayety, of pleasure, and above all of idleness; nothing obliges him to\r\nexert himself in order to subsist; and as he has no necessary\r\noccupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even attempt what\r\nwould be useful.\r\n\r\nBut the equality of fortunes, and the absence of slavery in the North,\r\nplunge the inhabitants in those same cares of daily life which are\r\ndisdained by the white population of the South. They are taught from\r\ninfancy to combat want, and to place comfort above all the pleasures of\r\nthe intellect or the heart. The imagination is extinguished by the\r\ntrivial details of life, and the ideas become less numerous and less\r\ngeneral, but far more practical and more precise. As prosperity is the\r\nsole aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained; nature and\r\nmankind are turned to the best pecuniary advantage, and society is\r\ndexterously made to contribute to the welfare of each of its members,\r\nwhilst individual egotism is the source of general happiness.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of the North has not only experience, but knowledge:\r\nnevertheless he sets but little value upon the pleasures of knowledge;\r\nhe esteems it as the means of attaining a certain end, and he is only\r\nanxious to seize its more lucrative applications. The citizen of the\r\nSouth is more given to act upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank,\r\nmore generous, more intellectual, and more brilliant. The former, with\r\na greater degree of activity, of common-sense, of information, and of\r\ngeneral aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil qualities of the\r\nmiddle classes. The latter has the tastes, the prejudices, the\r\nweaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aristocracies. If two men are\r\nunited in society, who have the same interests, and to a certain extent\r\nthe same opinions, but different characters, different acquirements,\r\nand a different style of civilization, it is probable that these men\r\nwill not agree. The same remark is applicable to a society of nations.\r\nSlavery, then, does not attack the American Union directly in its\r\ninterests, but indirectly in its manners.\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ Census of 1790, 3,929,328; 1830, 12,856,165; 1860, 31,443,321; 1870,\r\n38,555,983; 1890, 62,831,900.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe States which gave their assent to the federal contract in 1790 were\r\nthirteen in number; the Union now consists of thirty-four members. The\r\npopulation, which amounted to nearly 4,000,000 in 1790, had more than\r\ntripled in the space of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly\r\n13,000,000. *e Changes of such magnitude cannot take place without some\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nA society of nations, as well as a society of individuals, derives its\r\nprincipal chances of duration from the wisdom of its members, their\r\nindividual weakness, and their limited number. The Americans who quit\r\nthe coasts of the Atlantic Ocean to plunge into the western wilderness,\r\nare adventurers impatient of restraint, greedy of wealth, and\r\nfrequently men expelled from the States in which they were born. When\r\nthey arrive in the deserts they are unknown to each other, and they\r\nhave neither traditions, family feeling, nor the force of example to\r\ncheck their excesses. The empire of the laws is feeble amongst them;\r\nthat of morality is still more powerless. The settlers who are\r\nconstantly peopling the valley of the Mississippi are, then, in every\r\nrespect very inferior to the Americans who inhabit the older parts of\r\nthe Union. Nevertheless, they already exercise a great influence in its\r\ncouncils; and they arrive at the government of the commonwealth before\r\nthey have learnt to govern themselves. *f\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ This indeed is only a temporary danger. I have no doubt that in time\r\nsociety will assume as much stability and regularity in the West as it\r\nhas already done upon the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater the individual weakness of each of the contracting parties,\r\nthe greater are the chances of the duration of the contract; for their\r\nsafety is then dependent upon their union. When, in 1790, the most\r\npopulous of the American republics did not contain 500,000 inhabitants,\r\n*g each of them felt its own insignificance as an independent people,\r\nand this feeling rendered compliance with the federal authority more\r\neasy. But when one of the confederate States reckons, like the State of\r\nNew York, 2,000,000 of inhabitants, and covers an extent of territory\r\nequal in surface to a quarter of France, *h it feels its own strength;\r\nand although it may continue to support the Union as advantageous to\r\nits prosperity, it no longer regards that body as necessary to its\r\nexistence, and as it continues to belong to the federal compact, it\r\nsoon aims at preponderance in the federal assemblies. The probable\r\nunanimity of the States is diminished as their number increases. At\r\npresent the interests of the different parts of the Union are not at\r\nvariance; but who is able to foresee the multifarious changes of the\r\nfuture, in a country in which towns are founded from day to day, and\r\nStates almost from year to year?\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ Pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790 [and 5,258,014 in\r\n1890.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ The area of the State of New York is 49,170 square miles. [See U. S.\r\ncensus report of 1890.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the first settlement of the British colonies, the number of\r\ninhabitants has about doubled every twenty-two years. I perceive no\r\ncauses which are likely to check this progressive increase of the\r\nAnglo-American population for the next hundred years; and before that\r\nspace of time has elapsed, I believe that the territories and\r\ndependencies of the United States will be covered by more than\r\n100,000,000 of inhabitants, and divided into forty States. *i I admit\r\nthat these 100,000,000 of men have no hostile interests. I suppose, on\r\nthe contrary, that they are all equally interested in the maintenance\r\nof the Union; but I am still of opinion that where there are\r\n100,000,000 of men, and forty distinct nations, unequally strong, the\r\ncontinuance of the Federal Government can only be a fortunate accident.\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ If the population continues to double every twenty-two years, as it\r\nhas done for the last two hundred years, the number of inhabitants in\r\nthe United States in 1852 will be twenty millions; in 1874, forty-eight\r\nmillions; and in 1896, ninety-six millions. This may still be the case\r\neven if the lands on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains should be\r\nfound to be unfit for cultivation. The territory which is already\r\noccupied can easily contain this number of inhabitants. One hundred\r\nmillions of men disseminated over the surface of the twenty-four\r\nStates, and the three dependencies, which constitute the Union, would\r\nonly give 762 inhabitants to the square league; this would be far below\r\nthe mean population of France, which is 1,063 to the square league; or\r\nof England, which is 1,457; and it would even be below the population\r\nof Switzerland, for that country, notwithstanding its lakes and\r\nmountains, contains 783 inhabitants to the square league. See \xe2\x80\x9cMalte\r\nBrun,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. vi. p. 92.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The actual result has fallen somewhat short of these calculations, in\r\nspite of the vast territorial acquisitions of the United States: but in\r\n1899 the population is probably about eighty-seven millions, including\r\nthe population of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Porto Rico.]]\r\n\r\nWhatever faith I may have in the perfectibility of man, until human\r\nnature is altered, and men wholly transformed, I shall refuse to\r\nbelieve in the duration of a government which is called upon to hold\r\ntogether forty different peoples, disseminated over a territory equal\r\nto one-half of Europe in extent; to avoid all rivalry, ambition, and\r\nstruggles between them, and to direct their independent activity to the\r\naccomplishment of the same designs.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its increase\r\narises from the continual changes which take place in the position of\r\nits internal strength. The distance from Lake Superior to the Gulf of\r\nMexico extends from the 47th to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance\r\nof more than 1,200 miles as the bird flies. The frontier of the United\r\nStates winds along the whole of this immense line, sometimes falling\r\nwithin its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond it, into\r\nthe waste. It has been calculated that the whites advance every year a\r\nmean distance of seventeen miles along the whole of his vast boundary.\r\n*j Obstacles, such as an unproductive district, a lake or an Indian\r\nnation unexpectedly encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing\r\ncolumn then halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon\r\nthemselves, and as soon as they are reunited they proceed onwards. This\r\ngradual and continuous progress of the European race towards the Rocky\r\nMountains has the solemnity of a providential event; it is like a\r\ndeluge of men rising unabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin this first line of conquering settlers towns are built, and vast\r\nStates founded. In 1790 there were only a few thousand pioneers\r\nsprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi; and at the present day\r\nthese valleys contain as many inhabitants as were to be found in the\r\nwhole Union in 1790. Their population amounts to nearly 4,000,000. *k\r\nThe city of Washington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the\r\nUnion; but such are the changes which have taken place, that it now\r\nstands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most remote\r\nWestern States are already obliged to perform a journey as long as that\r\nfrom Vienna to Paris. *l\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ 3,672,317\xe2\x80\x94Census of 1830.]\r\n\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ The distance from Jefferson, the capital of the State of Missouri, to\r\nWashington is 1,019 miles. (\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Almanac,\xe2\x80\x9d 1831, p. 48.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the States are borne onwards at the same time in the path of\r\nfortune, but of course they do not all increase and prosper in the same\r\nproportion. To the North of the Union the detached branches of the\r\nAlleghany chain, which extend as far as the Atlantic Ocean, form\r\nspacious roads and ports, which are constantly accessible to vessels of\r\nthe greatest burden. But from the Potomac to the mouth of the\r\nMississippi the coast is sandy and flat. In this part of the Union the\r\nmouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few harbors\r\nwhich exist amongst these lagoons afford much shallower water to\r\nvessels, and much fewer commercial advantages than those of the North.\r\n\r\nThis first natural cause of inferiority is united to another cause\r\nproceeding from the laws. We have already seen that slavery, which is\r\nabolished in the North, still exists in the South; and I have pointed\r\nout its fatal consequences upon the prosperity of the planter himself.\r\n\r\nThe North is therefore superior to the South both in commerce *m and\r\nmanufacture; the natural consequence of which is the more rapid\r\nincrease of population and of wealth within its borders. The States\r\nsituate upon the shores of the Atlantic Ocean are already half-peopled.\r\nMost of the land is held by an owner; and these districts cannot\r\ntherefore receive so many emigrants as the Western States, where a\r\nboundless field is still open to their exertions. The valley of the\r\nMississippi is far more fertile than the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nThis reason, added to all the others, contributes to drive the\r\nEuropeans westward\xe2\x80\x94a fact which may be rigorously demonstrated by\r\nfigures. It is found that the sum total of the population of all the\r\nUnited States has about tripled in the course of forty years. But in\r\nthe recent States adjacent to the Mississippi, the population has\r\nincreased thirty-one-fold, within the same space of time. *n\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ The following statements will suffice to show the difference which\r\nexists between the commerce of the South and that of the North:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging to Virginia,\r\nthe two Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great Southern States),\r\namounted to only 5,243 tons. In the same year the tonnage of the\r\nvessels of the State of Massachusetts alone amounted to 17,322 tons.\r\n(See Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, 2d session, No. 140, p.\r\n244.) Thus the State of Massachusetts had three times as much shipping\r\nas the four above-mentioned States. Nevertheless the area of the State\r\nof Massachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its population amounts\r\nto 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in 1890]; whilst the area of the four\r\nother States I have quoted is 210,000 square miles, and their\r\npopulation 3,047,767. Thus the area of the State of Massachusetts forms\r\nonly one-thirtieth part of the area of the four States; and its\r\npopulation is five times smaller than theirs. (See \xe2\x80\x9cDarby\xe2\x80\x99s View of the\r\nUnited States.\xe2\x80\x9d) Slavery is prejudicial to the commercial prosperity of\r\nthe South in several different ways; by diminishing the spirit of\r\nenterprise amongst the whites, and by preventing them from meeting with\r\nas numerous a class of sailors as they require. Sailors are usually\r\ntaken from the lowest ranks of the population. But in the Southern\r\nStates these lowest ranks are composed of slaves, and it is very\r\ndifficult to employ them at sea. They are unable to serve as well as a\r\nwhite crew, and apprehensions would always be entertained of their\r\nmutinying in the middle of the ocean, or of their escaping in the\r\nforeign countries at which they might touch.]\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ \xe2\x80\x9cDarby\xe2\x80\x99s View of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 444.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative position of the central federal power is continually\r\ndisplaced. Forty years ago the majority of the citizens of the Union\r\nwas established upon the coast of the Atlantic, in the environs of the\r\nspot upon which Washington now stands; but the great body of the people\r\nis now advancing inland and to the north, so that in twenty years the\r\nmajority will unquestionably be on the western side of the Alleghanies.\r\nIf the Union goes on to subsist, the basin of the Mississippi is\r\nevidently marked out, by its fertility and its extent, as the future\r\ncentre of the Federal Government. In thirty or forty years, that tract\r\nof country will have assumed the rank which naturally belongs to it. It\r\nis easy to calculate that its population, compared to that of the coast\r\nof the Atlantic, will be, in round numbers, as 40 to 11. In a few years\r\nthe States which founded the Union will lose the direction of its\r\npolicy, and the population of the valley of the Mississippi will\r\npreponderate in the federal assemblies.\r\n\r\nThis constant gravitation of the federal power and influence towards\r\nthe northwest is shown every ten years, when a general census of the\r\npopulation is made, and the number of delegates which each State sends\r\nto Congress is settled afresh. *o In 1790 Virginia had nineteen\r\nrepresentatives in Congress. This number continued to increase until\r\nthe year 1813, when it reached to twenty-three; from that time it began\r\nto decrease, and in 1833 Virginia elected only twenty-one\r\nrepresentatives. *p During the same period the State of New York\r\nprogressed in the contrary direction: in 1790 it had ten\r\nrepresentatives in Congress; in 1813, twenty-seven; in 1823,\r\nthirty-four; and in 1833, forty. The State of Ohio had only one\r\nrepresentative in 1803, and in 1833 it had already nineteen.\r\n\r\no\r\n[ It may be seen that in the course of the last ten years (1820-1830)\r\nthe population of one district, as, for instance, the State of\r\nDelaware, has increased in the proportion of five per cent.; whilst\r\nthat of another, as the territory of Michigan, has increased 250 per\r\ncent. Thus the population of Virginia had augmented thirteen per cent.,\r\nand that of the border State of Ohio sixty-one per cent., in the same\r\nspace of time. The general table of these changes, which is given in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cNational Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d displays a striking picture of the unequal\r\nfortunes of the different States.]\r\n\r\n\r\np\r\n[ It has just been said that in the course of the last term the\r\npopulation of Virginia has increased thirteen per cent.; and it is\r\nnecessary to explain how the number of representatives for a State may\r\ndecrease, when the population of that State, far from diminishing, is\r\nactually upon the increase. I take the State of Virginia, to which I\r\nhave already alluded, as my term of comparison. The number of\r\nrepresentatives of Virginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total\r\nnumber of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which\r\nthe population bore to that of the whole Union: in 1833 the number of\r\nrepresentatives of Virginia was likewise proportionate to the total\r\nnumber of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which\r\nits population, augmented in the course of ten years, bore to the\r\naugmented population of the Union in the same space of time. The new\r\nnumber of Virginian representatives will then be to the old numver, on\r\nthe one hand, as the new numver of all the representatives is to the\r\nold number; and, on the other hand, as the augmentation of the\r\npopulation of Virginia is to that of the whole population of the\r\ncountry. Thus, if the increase of the population of the lesser country\r\nbe to that of the greater in an exact inverse ratio of the proportion\r\nbetween the new and the old numbers of all the representatives, the\r\nnumber of the representatives of Virginia will remain stationary; and\r\nif the increase of the Virginian population be to that of the whole\r\nUnion in a feeblerratio than the new number of the representatives of\r\nthe Union to the old number, the number of the representatives of\r\nVirginia must decrease. [Thus, to the 56th Congress in 1899, Virginia\r\nand West Virginia send only fourteen representatives.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine a durable union of a people which is rich\r\nand strong with one which is poor and weak, even if it were proved that\r\nthe strength and wealth of the one are not the causes of the weakness\r\nand poverty of the other. But union is still more difficult to maintain\r\nat a time at which one party is losing strength, and the other is\r\ngaining it. This rapid and disproportionate increase of certain States\r\nthreatens the independence of the others. New York might perhaps\r\nsucceed, with its 2,000,000 of inhabitants and its forty\r\nrepresentatives, in dictating to the other States in Congress. But even\r\nif the more powerful States make no attempt to bear down the lesser\r\nones, the danger still exists; for there is almost as much in the\r\npossibility of the act as in the act itself. The weak generally\r\nmistrust the justice and the reason of the strong. The States which\r\nincrease less rapidly than the others look upon those which are more\r\nfavored by fortune with envy and suspicion. Hence arise the deep-seated\r\nuneasiness and ill-defined agitation which are observable in the South,\r\nand which form so striking a contrast to the confidence and prosperity\r\nwhich are common to other parts of the Union. I am inclined to think\r\nthat the hostile measures taken by the Southern provinces upon a recent\r\noccasion are attributable to no other cause. The inhabitants of the\r\nSouthern States are, of all the Americans, those who are most\r\ninterested in the maintenance of the Union; they would assuredly suffer\r\nmost from being left to themselves; and yet they are the only citizens\r\nwho threaten to break the tie of confederation. But it is easy to\r\nperceive that the South, which has given four Presidents, Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe, to the Union, which perceives that it\r\nis losing its federal influence, and that the number of its\r\nrepresentatives in Congress is diminishing from year to year, whilst\r\nthose of the Northern and Western States are increasing; the South,\r\nwhich is peopled with ardent and irascible beings, is becoming more and\r\nmore irritated and alarmed. The citizens reflect upon their present\r\nposition and remember their past influence, with the melancholy\r\nuneasiness of men who suspect oppression: if they discover a law of the\r\nUnion which is not unequivocally favorable to their interests, they\r\nprotest against it as an abuse of force; and if their ardent\r\nremonstrances are not listened to, they threaten to quit an association\r\nwhich loads them with burdens whilst it deprives them of their due\r\nprofits. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tariff,\xe2\x80\x9d said the inhabitants of Carolina in 1832,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cenriches the North, and ruins the South; for if this were not the\r\ncase, to what can we attribute the continually increasing power and\r\nwealth of the North, with its inclement skies and arid soil; whilst the\r\nSouth, which may be styled the garden of America, is rapidly\r\ndeclining?\xe2\x80\x9d *q\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ See the report of its committee to the Convention which proclaimed\r\nthe nullification of the tariff in South Carolina.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the changes which I have described were gradual, so that each\r\ngeneration at least might have time to disappear with the order of\r\nthings under which it had lived, the danger would be less; but the\r\nprogress of society in America is precipitate, and almost\r\nrevolutionary. The same citizen may have lived to see his State take\r\nthe lead in the Union, and afterwards become powerless in the federal\r\nassemblies; and an Anglo-American republic has been known to grow as\r\nrapidly as a man passing from birth and infancy to maturity in the\r\ncourse of thirty years. It must not be imagined, however, that the\r\nStates which lose their preponderance, also lose their population or\r\ntheir riches: no stop is put to their prosperity, and they even go on\r\nto increase more rapidly than any kingdom in Europe. *r But they\r\nbelieve themselves to be impoverished because their wealth does not\r\naugment as rapidly as that of their neighbors; any they think that\r\ntheir power is lost, because they suddenly come into collision with a\r\npower greater than their own: *s thus they are more hurt in their\r\nfeelings and their passions than in their interests. But this is amply\r\nsufficient to endanger the maintenance of the Union. If kings and\r\npeoples had only had their true interests in view ever since the\r\nbeginning of the world, the name of war would scarcely be known among\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ The population of a country assuredly constitutes the first element\r\nof its wealth. In the ten years (1820-1830) during which Virginia lost\r\ntwo of its representatives in Congress, its population increased in the\r\nproportion of 13.7 per cent.; that of Carolina in the proportion of\r\nfifteen per cent.; and that of Georgia, 15.5 per cent. (See the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Almanac,\xe2\x80\x9d 1832, p. 162) But the population of Russia, which\r\nincreases more rapidly than that of any other European country, only\r\naugments in ten years at the rate of 9.5 per cent.; in France, at the\r\nrate of seven per cent.; and in Europe in general, at the rate of 4.7\r\nper cent. (See \xe2\x80\x9cMalte Brun,\xe2\x80\x9d vol. vi. p. 95)]\r\n\r\n\r\ns\r\n[ It must be admitted, however, that the depreciation which has taken\r\nplace in the value of tobacco, during the last fifty years, has notably\r\ndiminished the opulence of the Southern planters: but this circumstance\r\nis as independent of the will of their Northern brethren as it is of\r\ntheir own.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the prosperity of the United States is the source of the most\r\nserious dangers that threaten them, since it tends to create in some of\r\nthe confederate States that over-excitement which accompanies a rapid\r\nincrease of fortune; and to awaken in others those feelings of envy,\r\nmistrust, and regret which usually attend upon the loss of it. The\r\nAmericans contemplate this extraordinary and hasty progress with\r\nexultation; but they would be wiser to consider it with sorrow and\r\nalarm. The Americans of the United States must inevitably become one of\r\nthe greatest nations in the world; their offset will cover almost the\r\nwhole of North America; the continent which they inhabit is their\r\ndominion, and it cannot escape them. What urges them to take possession\r\nof it so soon? Riches, power, and renown cannot fail to be theirs at\r\nsome future time, but they rush upon their fortune as if but a moment\r\nremained for them to make it their own.\r\n\r\nI think that I have demonstrated that the existence of the present\r\nconfederation depends entirely on the continued assent of all the\r\nconfederates; and, starting from this principle, I have inquired into\r\nthe causes which may induce the several States to separate from the\r\nothers. The Union may, however, perish in two different ways: one of\r\nthe confederate States may choose to retire from the compact, and so\r\nforcibly to sever the federal tie; and it is to this supposition that\r\nmost of the remarks that I have made apply: or the authority of the\r\nFederal Government may be progressively entrenched on by the\r\nsimultaneous tendency of the united republics to resume their\r\nindependence. The central power, successively stripped of all its\r\nprerogatives, and reduced to impotence by tacit consent, would become\r\nincompetent to fulfil its purpose; and the second Union would perish,\r\nlike the first, by a sort of senile inaptitude. The gradual weakening\r\nof the federal tie, which may finally lead to the dissolution of the\r\nUnion, is a distinct circumstance, that may produce a variety of minor\r\nconsequences before it operates so violent a change. The confederation\r\nmight still subsist, although its Government were reduced to such a\r\ndegree of inanition as to paralyze the nation, to cause internal\r\nanarchy, and to check the general prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter having investigated the causes which may induce the\r\nAnglo-Americans to disunite, it is important to inquire whether, if the\r\nUnion continues to subsist, their Government will extend or contract\r\nits sphere of action, and whether it will become more energetic or more\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nThe Americans are evidently disposed to look upon their future\r\ncondition with alarm. They perceive that in most of the nations of the\r\nworld the exercise of the rights of sovereignty tends to fall under the\r\ncontrol of a few individuals, and they are dismayed by the idea that\r\nsuch will also be the case in their own country. Even the statesmen\r\nfeel, or affect to feel, these fears; for, in America, centralization\r\nis by no means popular, and there is no surer means of courting the\r\nmajority than by inveighing against the encroachments of the central\r\npower. The Americans do not perceive that the countries in which this\r\nalarming tendency to centralization exists are inhabited by a single\r\npeople; whilst the fact of the Union being composed of different\r\nconfederate communities is sufficient to baffle all the inferences\r\nwhich might be drawn from analogous circumstances. I confess that I am\r\ninclined to consider the fears of a great number of Americans as purely\r\nimaginary; and far from participating in their dread of the\r\nconsolidation of power in the hands of the Union, I think that the\r\nFederal Government is visibly losing strength.\r\n\r\nTo prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any remote\r\noccurrences, but to circumstances which I have myself witnessed, and\r\nwhich belong to our own time.\r\n\r\nAn attentive examination of what is going on in the United States will\r\neasily convince us that two opposite tendencies exist in that country,\r\nlike two distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same\r\nchannel. The Union has now existed for forty-five years, and in the\r\ncourse of that time a vast number of provincial prejudices, which were\r\nat first hostile to its power, have died away. The patriotic feeling\r\nwhich attached each of the Americans to his own native State is become\r\nless exclusive; and the different parts of the Union have become more\r\nintimately connected the better they have become acquainted with each\r\nother. The post, *t that great instrument of intellectual intercourse,\r\nnow reaches into the backwoods; and steamboats have established daily\r\nmeans of communication between the different points of the coast. An\r\ninland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodities up and\r\ndown the rivers of the country. *u And to these facilities of nature\r\nand art may be added those restless cravings, that busy-mindedness, and\r\nlove of pelf, which are constantly urging the American into active\r\nlife, and bringing him into contact with his fellow-citizens. He\r\ncrosses the country in every direction; he visits all the various\r\npopulations of the land; and there is not a province in France in which\r\nthe natives are so well known to each other as the 13,000,000 of men\r\nwho cover the territory of the United States.\r\n\r\nt\r\n[ In 1832, the district of Michigan, which only contains 31,639\r\ninhabitants, and is still an almost unexplored wilderness, possessed\r\n940 miles of mail-roads. The territory of Arkansas, which is still more\r\nuncultivated, was already intersected by 1,938 miles of mail-roads.\r\n(See the report of the General Post Office, November 30, 1833.) The\r\npostage of newspapers alone in the whole Union amounted to $254,796.]\r\n\r\n\r\nu\r\n[ In the course of ten years, from 1821 to 1831, 271 steamboats have\r\nbeen launched upon the rivers which water the valley of the Mississippi\r\nalone. In 1829 259 steamboats existed in the United States. (See\r\nLegislative Documents, No. 140, p. 274.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whilst the Americans intermingle, they grow in resemblance of each\r\nother; the differences resulting from their climate, their origin, and\r\ntheir institutions, diminish; and they all draw nearer and nearer to\r\nthe common type. Every year, thousands of men leave the North to settle\r\nin different parts of the Union: they bring with them their faith,\r\ntheir opinions, and their manners; and as they are more enlighthned\r\nthan the men amongst whom they are about to dwell, they soon rise to\r\nthe head of affairs, and they adapt society to their own advantage.\r\nThis continual emigration of the North to the South is peculiarly\r\nfavorable to the fusion of all the different provincial characters into\r\none national character. The civilization of the North appears to be the\r\ncommon standard, to which the whole nation will one day be assimilated.\r\n\r\nThe commercial ties which unite the confederate States are strengthened\r\nby the increasing manufactures of the Americans; and the union which\r\nbegan to exist in their opinions, gradually forms a part of their\r\nhabits: the course of time has swept away the bugbear thoughts which\r\nhaunted the imaginations of the citizens in 1789. The federal power is\r\nnot become oppressive; it has not destroyed the independence of the\r\nStates; it has not subjected the confederates to monarchial\r\ninstitutions; and the Union has not rendered the lesser States\r\ndependent upon the larger ones; but the confederation has continued to\r\nincrease in population, in wealth, and in power. I am therefore\r\nconvinced that the natural obstacles to the continuance of the American\r\nUnion are not so powerful at the present time as they were in 1789; and\r\nthat the enemies of the Union are not so numerous.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the United States\r\nfor the last forty-five years will readily convince us that the federal\r\npower is declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this\r\nphenomenon. *v When the Constitution of 1789 was promulgated, the\r\nnation was a prey to anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this\r\nconfusion, excited much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly\r\nsupported because it satisfied an imperious want. Thus, although it was\r\nmore attacked than it is now, the federal power soon reached the\r\nmaximum of its authority, as is usually the case with a government\r\nwhich triumphs after having braced its strength by the struggle. At\r\nthat time the interpretation of the Constitution seemed to extend,\r\nrather than to repress, the federal sovereignty; and the Union offered,\r\nin several respects, the appearance of a single and undivided people,\r\ndirected in its foreign and internal policy by a single Government. But\r\nto attain this point the people had risen, to a certain extent, above\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nv\r\n[ [Since 1861 the movement is certainly in the opposite direction, and\r\nthe federal power has largely increased, and tends to further\r\nincrease.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution had not destroyed the distinct sovereignty of the\r\nStates; and all communities, of whatever nature they may be, are\r\nimpelled by a secret propensity to assert their independence. This\r\npropensity is still more decided in a country like America, in which\r\nevery village forms a sort of republic accustomed to conduct its own\r\naffairs. It therefore cost the States an effort to submit to the\r\nfederal supremacy; and all efforts, however successful they may be,\r\nnecessarily subside with the causes in which they originated.\r\n\r\nAs the Federal Government consolidated its authority, America resumed\r\nits rank amongst the nations, peace returned to its frontiers, and\r\npublic credit was restored; confusion was succeeded by a fixed state of\r\nthings, which was favorable to the full and free exercise of\r\nindustrious enterprise. It was this very prosperity which made the\r\nAmericans forget the cause to which it was attributable; and when once\r\nthe danger was passed, the energy and the patriotism which had enabled\r\nthem to brave it disappeared from amongst them. No sooner were they\r\ndelivered from the cares which oppressed them, than they easily\r\nreturned to their ordinary habits, and gave themselves up without\r\nresistance to their natural inclinations. When a powerful Government no\r\nlonger appeared to be necessary, they once more began to think it\r\nirksome. The Union encouraged a general prosperity, and the States were\r\nnot inclined to abandon the Union; but they desired to render the\r\naction of the power which represented that body as light as possible.\r\nThe general principle of Union was adopted, but in every minor detail\r\nthere was an actual tendency to independence. The principle of\r\nconfederation was every day more easily admitted, and more rarely\r\napplied; so that the Federal Government brought about its own decline,\r\nwhilst it was creating order and peace.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this tendency of public opinion began to be manifested\r\nexternally, the leaders of parties, who live by the passions of the\r\npeople, began to work it to their own advantage. The position of the\r\nFederal Government then became exceedingly critical. Its enemies were\r\nin possession of the popular favor; and they obtained the right of\r\nconducting its policy by pledging themselves to lessen its influence.\r\nFrom that time forwards the Government of the Union has invariably been\r\nobliged to recede, as often as it has attempted to enter the lists with\r\nthe governments of the States. And whenever an interpretation of the\r\nterms of the Federal Constitution has been called for, that\r\ninterpretation has most frequently been opposed to the Union, and\r\nfavorable to the States.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution invested the Federal Government with the right of\r\nproviding for the interests of the nation; and it had been held that no\r\nother authority was so fit to superintend the \xe2\x80\x9cinternal improvements\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich affected the prosperity of the whole Union; such, for instance,\r\nas the cutting of canals. But the States were alarmed at a power,\r\ndistinct from their own, which could thus dispose of a portion of their\r\nterritory; and they were afraid that the central Government would, by\r\nthis means, acquire a formidable extent of patronage within their own\r\nconfines, and exercise a degree of influence which they intended to\r\nreserve exclusively to their own agents. The Democratic party, which\r\nhas constantly been opposed to the increase of the federal authority,\r\nthen accused the Congress of usurpation, and the Chief Magistrate of\r\nambition. The central Government was intimidated by the opposition; and\r\nit soon acknowledged its error, promising exactly to confine its\r\ninfluence for the future within the circle which was prescribed to it.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution confers upon the Union the right of treating with\r\nforeign nations. The Indian tribes, which border upon the frontiers of\r\nthe United States, had usually been regarded in this light. As long as\r\nthese savages consented to retire before the civilized settlers, the\r\nfederal right was not contested: but as soon as an Indian tribe\r\nattempted to fix its dwelling upon a given spot, the adjacent States\r\nclaimed possession of the lands and the rights of sovereignty over the\r\nnatives. The central Government soon recognized both these claims; and\r\nafter it had concluded treaties with the Indians as independent\r\nnations, it gave them up as subjects to the legislative tyranny of the\r\nStates. *w\r\n\r\nw\r\n[ See in the Legislative Documents, already quoted in speaking of the\r\nIndians, the letter of the President of the United States to the\r\nCherokees, his correspondence on this subject with his agents, and his\r\nmessages to Congress.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the States which had been founded upon the coast of the\r\nAtlantic, extended indefinitely to the West, into wild regions where no\r\nEuropean had ever penetrated. The States whose confines were\r\nirrevocably fixed, looked with a jealous eye upon the unbounded regions\r\nwhich the future would enable their neighbors to explore. The latter\r\nthen agreed, with a view to conciliate the others, and to facilitate\r\nthe act of union, to lay down their own boundaries, and to abandon all\r\nthe territory which lay beyond those limits to the confederation at\r\nlarge. *x Thenceforward the Federal Government became the owner of all\r\nthe uncultivated lands which lie beyond the borders of the thirteen\r\nStates first confederated. It was invested with the right of parcelling\r\nand selling them, and the sums derived from this source were\r\nexclusively reserved to the public treasure of the Union, in order to\r\nfurnish supplies for purchasing tracts of country from the Indians, for\r\nopening roads to the remote settlements, and for accelerating the\r\nincrease of civilization as much as possible. New States have, however,\r\nbeen formed in the course of time, in the midst of those wilds which\r\nwere formerly ceded by the inhabitants of the shores of the Atlantic.\r\nCongress has gone on to sell, for the profit of the nation at large,\r\nthe uncultivated lands which those new States contained. But the latter\r\nat length asserted that, as they were now fully constituted, they ought\r\nto enjoy the exclusive right of converting the produce of these sales\r\nto their own use. As their remonstrances became more and more\r\nthreatening, Congress thought fit to deprive the Union of a portion of\r\nthe privileges which it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832 it\r\npassed a law by which the greatest part of the revenue derived from the\r\nsale of lands was made over to the new western republics, although the\r\nlands themselves were not ceded to them. *y\r\n\r\nx\r\n[ The first act of session was made by the State of New York in 1780;\r\nVirginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South and North Carolina,\r\nfollowed this example at different times, and lastly, the act of\r\ncession of Georgia was made as recently as 1802.]\r\n\r\n\r\ny\r\n[ It is true that the President refused his assent to this law; but he\r\ncompletely adopted it in principle. (See Message of December 8, 1833.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slightest observation in the United States enables one to\r\nappreciate the advantages which the country derives from the bank.\r\nThese advantages are of several kinds, but one of them is peculiarly\r\nstriking to the stranger. The banknotes of the United States are taken\r\nupon the borders of the desert for the same value as at Philadelphia,\r\nwhere the bank conducts its operations. *z\r\n\r\nz\r\n[ The present Bank of the United States was established in 1816, with a\r\ncapital of $35,000,000; its charter expires in 1836. Last year Congress\r\npassed a law to renew it, but the President put his veto upon the bill.\r\nThe struggle is still going on with great violence on either side, and\r\nthe speedy fall of the bank may easily be foreseen. [It was soon\r\nafterwards extinguished by General Jackson.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States is nevertheless the object of great\r\nanimosity. Its directors have proclaimed their hostility to the\r\nPresident: and they are accused, not without some show of probability,\r\nof having abused their influence to thwart his election. The President\r\ntherefore attacks the establishment which they represent with all the\r\nwarmth of personal enmity; and he is encouraged in the pursuit of his\r\nrevenge by the conviction that he is supported by the secret\r\npropensities of the majority. The bank may be regarded as the great\r\nmonetary tie of the Union, just as Congress is the great legislative\r\ntie; and the same passions which tend to render the States independent\r\nof the central power, contribute to the overthrow of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States always holds a great number of the notes\r\nissued by the provincial banks, which it can at any time oblige them to\r\nconvert into cash. It has itself nothing to fear from a similar demand,\r\nas the extent of its resources enables it to meet all claims. But the\r\nexistence of the provincial banks is thus threatened, and their\r\noperations are restricted, since they are only able to issue a quantity\r\nof notes duly proportioned to their capital. They submit with\r\nimpatience to this salutary control. The newspapers which they have\r\nbought over, and the President, whose interest renders him their\r\ninstrument, attack the bank with the greatest vehemence. They rouse the\r\nlocal passions and the blind democratic instinct of the country to aid\r\ntheir cause; and they assert that the bank directors form a permanent\r\naristocratic body, whose influence must ultimately be felt in the\r\nGovernment, and must affect those principles of equality upon which\r\nsociety rests in America.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the bank and its opponents is only an incident in\r\nthe great struggle which is going on in America between the provinces\r\nand the central power; between the spirit of democratic independence\r\nand the spirit of gradation and subordination. I do not mean that the\r\nenemies of the bank are identically the same individuals who, on other\r\npoints, attack the Federal Government; but I assert that the attacks\r\ndirected against the bank of the United States originate in the same\r\npropensities which militate against the Federal Government; and that\r\nthe very numerous opponents of the former afford a deplorable symptom\r\nof the decreasing support of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Union has never displayed so much weakness as in the celebrated\r\nquestion of the tariff. *a The wars of the French Revolution and of\r\n1812 had created manufacturing establishments in the North of the\r\nUnion, by cutting off all free communication between America and\r\nEurope. When peace was concluded, and the channel of intercourse\r\nreopened by which the produce of Europe was transmitted to the New\r\nWorld, the Americans thought fit to establish a system of import\r\nduties, for the twofold purpose of protecting their incipient\r\nmanufactures and of paying off the amount of the debt contracted during\r\nthe war. The Southern States, which have no manufactures to encourage,\r\nand which are exclusively agricultural, soon complained of this\r\nmeasure. Such were the simple facts, and I do not pretend to examine in\r\nthis place whether their complaints were well founded or unjust.\r\n\r\na\r\n[ See principally for the details of this affair, the Legislative\r\nDocuments, 22d Congress, 2d Session, No. 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1820, South Carolina declared, in a petition to\r\nCongress, that the tariff was \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional, oppressive, and\r\nunjust.\xe2\x80\x9d And the States of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama,\r\nand Mississippi subsequently remonstrated against it with more or less\r\nvigor. But Congress, far from lending an ear to these complaints,\r\nraised the scale of tariff duties in the years 1824 and 1828, and\r\nrecognized anew the principle on which it was founded. A doctrine was\r\nthen proclaimed, or rather revived, in the South, which took the name\r\nof Nullification.\r\n\r\nI have shown in the proper place that the object of the Federal\r\nConstitution was not to form a league, but to create a national\r\ngovernment. The Americans of the United States form a sole and\r\nundivided people, in all the cases which are specified by that\r\nConstitution; and upon these points the will of the nation is\r\nexpressed, as it is in all constitutional nations, by the voice of the\r\nmajority. When the majority has pronounced its decision, it is the duty\r\nof the minority to submit. Such is the sound legal doctrine, and the\r\nonly one which agrees with the text of the Constitution, and the known\r\nintention of those who framed it.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Nullification in the South maintain, on the contrary,\r\nthat the intention of the Americans in uniting was not to reduce\r\nthemselves to the condition of one and the same people; that they meant\r\nto constitute a league of independent States; and that each State,\r\nconsequently retains its entire sovereignty, if not de facto, at least\r\nde jure; and has the right of putting its own construction upon the\r\nlaws of Congress, and of suspending their execution within the limits\r\nof its own territory, if they are held to be unconstitutional and\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\nThe entire doctrine of Nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered\r\nby Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that party in the South, before\r\nthe Senate of the United States, in the year 1833: could: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nConstitution is a compact to which the States were parties in their\r\nsovereign capacity; now, whenever a compact is entered into by parties\r\nwhich acknowledge no tribunal above their authority to decide in the\r\nlast resort, each of them has a right to judge for itself in relation\r\nto the nature, extent, and obligations of the instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d It is\r\nevident that a similar doctrine destroys the very basis of the Federal\r\nConstitution, and brings back all the evils of the old confederation,\r\nfrom which the Americans were supposed to have had a safe deliverance.\r\n\r\nWhen South Carolina perceived that Congress turned a deaf ear to its\r\nremonstrances, it threatened to apply the doctrine of nullification to\r\nthe federal tariff bill. Congress persisted in its former system; and\r\nat length the storm broke out. In the course of 1832 the citizens of\r\nSouth Carolina, *b named a national Convention, to consult upon the\r\nextraordinary measures which they were called upon to take; and on\r\nNovember 24th of the same year this Convention promulgated a law, under\r\nthe form of a decree, which annulled the federal law of the tariff,\r\nforbade the levy of the imposts which that law commands, and refused to\r\nrecognize the appeal which might be made to the federal courts of law.\r\n*c This decree was only to be put in execution in the ensuing month of\r\nFebruary, and it was intimated, that if Congress modified the tariff\r\nbefore that period, South Carolina might be induced to proceed no\r\nfurther with her menaces; and a vague desire was afterwards expressed\r\nof submitting the question to an extraordinary assembly of all the\r\nconfederate States.\r\n\r\nb\r\n[ That is to say, the majority of the people; for the opposite party,\r\ncalled the Union party, always formed a very strong and active\r\nminority. Carolina may contain about 47,000 electors; 30,000 were in\r\nfavor of nullification, and 17,000 opposed to it.]\r\n\r\n\r\nc\r\n[ This decree was preceded by a report of the committee by which it was\r\nframed, containing the explanation of the motives and object of the\r\nlaw. The following passage occurs in it, p. 34:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the rights\r\nreserved by the Constitution to the different States are deliberately\r\nviolated, it is the duty and the right of those States to interfere, in\r\norder to check the progress of the evil; to resist usurpation, and to\r\nmaintain, within their respective limits, those powers and privileges\r\nwhich belong to them as independent sovereign States. If they were\r\ndestitute of this right, they would not be sovereign. South Carolina\r\ndeclares that she acknowledges no tribunal upon earth above her\r\nauthority. She has indeed entered into a solemn compact of union with\r\nthe other States; but she demands, and will exercise, the right of\r\nputting her own construction upon it; and when this compact is violated\r\nby her sister States, and by the Government which they have created,\r\nshe is determined to avail herself of the unquestionable right of\r\njudging what is the extent of the infraction, and what are the measures\r\nbest fitted to obtain justice.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime South Carolina armed her militia, and prepared for war.\r\nBut Congress, which had slighted its suppliant subjects, listened to\r\ntheir complaints as soon as they were found to have taken up arms. *d A\r\nlaw was passed, by which the tariff duties were to be progressively\r\nreduced for ten years, until they were brought so low as not to exceed\r\nthe amount of supplies necessary to the Government. *e Thus Congress\r\ncompletely abandoned the principle of the tariff; and substituted a\r\nmere fiscal impost to a system of protective duties. *f The Government\r\nof the Union, in order to conceal its defeat, had recourse to an\r\nexpedient which is very much in vogue with feeble governments. It\r\nyielded the point de facto, but it remained inflexible upon the\r\nprinciples in question; and whilst Congress was altering the tariff\r\nlaw, it passed another bill, by which the President was invested with\r\nextraordinary powers, enabling him to overcome by force a resistance\r\nwhich was then no longer to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nd\r\n[ Congress was finally decided to take this step by the conduct of the\r\npowerful State of Virginia, whose legislature offered to serve as\r\nmediator between the Union and South Carolina. Hitherto the latter\r\nState had appeared to be entirely abandoned, even by the States which\r\nhad joined in her remonstrances.]\r\n\r\n\r\ne\r\n[ This law was passed on March 2, 1833.]\r\n\r\n\r\nf\r\n[ This bill was brought in by Mr. Clay, and it passed in four days\r\nthrough both Houses of Congress by an immense majority.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut South Carolina did not consent to leave the Union in the enjoyment\r\nof these scanty trophies of success: the same national Convention which\r\nhad annulled the tariff bill, met again, and accepted the proffered\r\nconcession; but at the same time it declared it unabated perseverance\r\nin the doctrine of Nullification: and to prove what it said, it\r\nannulled the law investing the President with extraordinary powers,\r\nalthough it was very certain that the clauses of that law would never\r\nbe carried into effect.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the controversies of which I have been speaking have taken\r\nplace under the Presidency of General Jackson; and it cannot be denied\r\nthat in the question of the tariff he has supported the claims of the\r\nUnion with vigor and with skill. I am, however, of opinion that the\r\nconduct of the individual who now represents the Federal Government may\r\nbe reckoned as one of the dangers which threaten its continuance.\r\n\r\nSome persons in Europe have formed an opinion of the possible influence\r\nof General Jackson upon the affairs of his country, which appears\r\nhighly extravagant to those who have seen more of the subject. We have\r\nbeen told that General Jackson has won sundry battles, that he is an\r\nenergetic man, prone by nature and by habit to the use of force,\r\ncovetous of power, and a despot by taste. All this may perhaps be true;\r\nbut the inferences which have been drawn from these truths are\r\nexceedingly erroneous. It has been imagined that General Jackson is\r\nbent on establishing a dictatorship in America, on introducing a\r\nmilitary spirit, and on giving a degree of influence to the central\r\nauthority which cannot but be dangerous to provincial liberties. But in\r\nAmerica the time for similar undertakings, and the age for men of this\r\nkind, is not yet come: if General Jackson had entertained a hope of\r\nexercising his authority in this manner, he would infallibly have\r\nforfeited his political station, and compromised his life; accordingly\r\nhe has not been so imprudent as to make any such attempt.\r\n\r\nFar from wishing to extend the federal power, the President belongs to\r\nthe party which is desirous of limiting that power to the bare and\r\nprecise letter of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction\r\nupon that act favorable to the Government of the Union; far from\r\nstanding forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is\r\nthe agent of all the jealousies of the States; and he was placed in the\r\nlofty station he occupies by the passions of the people which are most\r\nopposed to the central Government. It is by perpetually flattering\r\nthese passions that he maintains his station and his popularity.\r\nGeneral Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes,\r\nits propensities, and its demands; say rather, that he anticipates and\r\nforestalls them.\r\n\r\nWhenever the governments of the States come into collision with that of\r\nthe Union, the President is generally the first to question his own\r\nrights: he almost always outstrips the legislature; and when the extent\r\nof the federal power is controverted, he takes part, as it were,\r\nagainst himself; he conceals his official interests, and extinguishes\r\nhis own natural inclinations. Not indeed that he is naturally weak or\r\nhostile to the Union; for when the majority decided against the claims\r\nof the partisans of nullification, he put himself at its head, asserted\r\nthe doctrines which the nation held distinctly and energetically, and\r\nwas the first to recommend forcible measures; but General Jackson\r\nappears to me, if I may use the American expressions, to be a\r\nFederalist by taste, and a Republican by calculation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority, but when he\r\nfeels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the\r\npursuit of the objects which the community approves, or of those which\r\nit does not look upon with a jealous eye. He is supported by a power\r\nwith which his predecessors were unacquainted; and he tramples on his\r\npersonal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility which no\r\nformer President ever enjoyed; he takes upon himself the responsibility\r\nof measures which no one before him would have ventured to attempt: he\r\neven treats the national representatives with disdain approaching to\r\ninsult; he puts his veto upon the laws of Congress, and frequently\r\nneglects to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes\r\ntreats his master roughly. The power of General Jackson perpetually\r\nincreases; but that of the President declines; in his hands the Federal\r\nGovernment is strong, but it will pass enfeebled into the hands of his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nI am strangely mistaken if the Federal Government of the United States\r\nbe not constantly losing strength, retiring gradually from public\r\naffairs, and narrowing its circle of action more and more. It is\r\nnaturally feeble, but it now abandons even its pretensions to strength.\r\nOn the other hand, I thought that I remarked a more lively sense of\r\nindependence, and a more decided attachment to provincial government in\r\nthe States. The Union is to subsist, but to subsist as a shadow; it is\r\nto be strong in certain cases, and weak in all others; in time of\r\nwarfare, it is to be able to concentrate all the forces of the nation\r\nand all the resources of the country in its hands; and in time of peace\r\nits existence is to be scarcely perceptible: as if this alternate\r\ndebility and vigor were natural or possible.\r\n\r\nI do not foresee anything for the present which may be able to check\r\nthis general impulse of public opinion; the causes in which it\r\noriginated do not cease to operate with the same effect. The change\r\nwill therefore go on, and it may be predicted that, unless some\r\nextraordinary event occurs, the Government of the Union will grow\r\nweaker and weaker every day.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that the period is still remote at which the federal\r\npower will be entirely extinguished by its inability to protect itself\r\nand to maintain peace in the country. The Union is sanctioned by the\r\nmanners and desires of the people; its results are palpable, its\r\nbenefits visible. When it is perceived that the weakness of the Federal\r\nGovernment compromises the existence of the Union, I do not doubt that\r\na reaction will take place with a view to increase its strength.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is, of all the federal governments\r\nwhich have hitherto been established, the one which is most naturally\r\ndestined to act. As long as it is only indirectly assailed by the\r\ninterpretation of its laws, and as long as its substance is not\r\nseriously altered, a change of opinion, an internal crisis, or a war,\r\nmay restore all the vigor which it requires. The point which I have\r\nbeen most anxious to put in a clear light is simply this: Many people,\r\nespecially in France, imagine that a change in opinion is going on in\r\nthe United States, which is favorable to a centralization of power in\r\nthe hands of the President and the Congress. I hold that a contrary\r\ntendency may distinctly be observed. So far is the Federal Government\r\nfrom acquiring strength, and from threatening the sovereignty of the\r\nStates, as it grows older, that I maintain it to be growing weaker and\r\nweaker, and that the sovereignty of the Union alone is in danger. Such\r\nare the facts which the present time discloses. The future conceals the\r\nfinal result of this tendency, and the events which may check, retard,\r\nor accelerate the changes I have described; but I do not affect to be\r\nable to remove the veil which hides them from our sight.\r\n\r\nOf The Republican Institutions Of The United States, And What Their\r\nChances Of Duration Are\r\n\r\nThe Union is accidental\xe2\x80\x94The Republican institutions have more prospect\r\nof permanence\xe2\x80\x94A republic for the present the natural state of the\r\nAnglo-Americans\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94In order to destroy it, all the laws\r\nmust be changed at the same time, and a great alteration take place in\r\nmanners\xe2\x80\x94Difficulties experienced by the Americans in creating an\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe dismemberment of the Union, by the introduction of war into the\r\nheart of those States which are now confederate, with standing armies,\r\na dictatorship, and a heavy taxation, might, eventually, compromise the\r\nfate of the republican institutions. But we ought not to confound the\r\nfuture prospects of the republic with those of the Union. The Union is\r\nan accident, which will only last as long as circumstances are\r\nfavorable to its existence; but a republican form of government seems\r\nto me to be the natural state of the Americans; which nothing but the\r\ncontinued action of hostile causes, always acting in the same\r\ndirection, could change into a monarchy. The Union exists principally\r\nin the law which formed it; one revolution, one change in public\r\nopinion, might destroy it forever; but the republic has a much deeper\r\nfoundation to rest upon.\r\n\r\nWhat is understood by a republican government in the United States is\r\nthe slow and quiet action of society upon itself. It is a regular state\r\nof things really founded upon the enlightened will of the people. It is\r\na conciliatory government under which resolutions are allowed time to\r\nripen; and in which they are deliberately discussed, and executed with\r\nmature judgment. The republicans in the United States set a high value\r\nupon morality, respect religious belief, and acknowledge the existence\r\nof rights. They profess to think that a people ought to be moral,\r\nreligious, and temperate, in proportion as it is free. What is called\r\nthe republic in the United States, is the tranquil rule of the\r\nmajority, which, after having had time to examine itself, and to give\r\nproof of its existence, is the common source of all the powers of the\r\nState. But the power of the majority is not of itself unlimited. In the\r\nmoral world humanity, justice, and reason enjoy an undisputed\r\nsupremacy; in the political world vested rights are treated with no\r\nless deference. The majority recognizes these two barriers; and if it\r\nnow and then overstep them, it is because, like individuals, it has\r\npassions, and, like them, it is prone to do what is wrong, whilst it\r\ndiscerns what is right.\r\n\r\nBut the demagogues of Europe have made strange discoveries. A republic\r\nis not, according to them, the rule of the majority, as has hitherto\r\nbeen thought, but the rule of those who are strenuous partisans of the\r\nmajority. It is not the people who preponderates in this kind of\r\ngovernment, but those who are best versed in the good qualities of the\r\npeople. A happy distinction, which allows men to act in the name of\r\nnations without consulting them, and to claim their gratitude whilst\r\ntheir rights are spurned. A republican government, moreover, is the\r\nonly one which claims the right of doing whatever it chooses, and\r\ndespising what men have hitherto respected, from the highest moral\r\nobligations to the vulgar rules of common-sense. It had been supposed,\r\nuntil our time, that despotism was odious, under whatever form it\r\nappeared. But it is a discovery of modern days that there are such\r\nthings as legitimate tyranny and holy injustice, provided they are\r\nexercised in the name of the people.\r\n\r\nThe ideas which the Americans have adopted respecting the republican\r\nform of government, render it easy for them to live under it, and\r\ninsure its duration. If, in their country, this form be often\r\npractically bad, at least it is theoretically good; and, in the end,\r\nthe people always acts in conformity to it.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible at the foundation of the States, and it would still\r\nbe difficult, to establish a central administration in America. The\r\ninhabitants are dispersed over too great a space, and separated by too\r\nmany natural obstacles, for one man to undertake to direct the details\r\nof their existence. America is therefore pre-eminently the country of\r\nprovincial and municipal government. To this cause, which was plainly\r\nfelt by all the Europeans of the New World, the Anglo-Americans added\r\nseveral others peculiar to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the settlement of the North American colonies, municipal\r\nliberty had already penetrated into the laws as well as the manners of\r\nthe English; and the emigrants adopted it, not only as a necessary\r\nthing, but as a benefit which they knew how to appreciate. We have\r\nalready seen the manner in which the colonies were founded: every\r\nprovince, and almost every district, was peopled separately by men who\r\nwere strangers to each other, or who associated with very different\r\npurposes. The English settlers in the United States, therefore, early\r\nperceived that they were divided into a great number of small and\r\ndistinct communities which belonged to no common centre; and that it\r\nwas needful for each of these little communities to take care of its\r\nown affairs, since there did not appear to be any central authority\r\nwhich was naturally bound and easily enabled to provide for them. Thus,\r\nthe nature of the country, the manner in which the British colonies\r\nwere founded, the habits of the first emigrants, in short everything,\r\nunited to promote, in an extraordinary degree, municipal and provincial\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, therefore, the mass of the institutions of the\r\ncountry is essentially republican; and in order permanently to destroy\r\nthe laws which form the basis of the republic, it would be necessary to\r\nabolish all the laws at once. At the present day it would be even more\r\ndifficult for a party to succeed in founding a monarchy in the United\r\nStates than for a set of men to proclaim that France should\r\nhenceforward be a republic. Royalty would not find a system of\r\nlegislation prepared for it beforehand; and a monarchy would then\r\nexist, really surrounded by republican institutions. The monarchical\r\nprinciple would likewise have great difficulty in penetrating into the\r\nmanners of the Americans.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated\r\ndoctrine bearing no relation to the prevailing manners and ideas of the\r\npeople: it may, on the contrary, be regarded as the last link of a\r\nchain of opinions which binds the whole Anglo-American world. That\r\nProvidence has given to every human being the degree of reason\r\nnecessary to direct himself in the affairs which interest him\r\nexclusively\xe2\x80\x94such is the grand maxim upon which civil and political\r\nsociety rests in the United States. The father of a family applies it\r\nto his children; the master to his servants; the township to its\r\nofficers; the province to its townships; the State to its provinces;\r\nthe Union to the States; and when extended to the nation, it becomes\r\nthe doctrine of the sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\nThus, in the United States, the fundamental principle of the republic\r\nis the same which governs the greater part of human actions; republican\r\nnotions insinuate themselves into all the ideas, opinions, and habits\r\nof the Americans, whilst they are formerly recognized by the\r\nlegislation: and before this legislation can be altered the whole\r\ncommunity must undergo very serious changes. In the United States, even\r\nthe religion of most of the citizens is republican, since it submits\r\nthe truths of the other world to private judgment: as in politics the\r\ncare of its temporal interests is abandoned to the good sense of the\r\npeople. Thus every man is allowed freely to take that road which he\r\nthinks will lead him to heaven; just as the law permits every citizen\r\nto have the right of choosing his government.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all having the\r\nsame tendency, can substitute for this combination of laws, opinions,\r\nand manners, a mass of opposite opinions, manners, and laws.\r\n\r\nIf republican principles are to perish in America, they can only yield\r\nafter a laborious social process, often interrupted, and as often\r\nresumed; they will have many apparent revivals, and will not become\r\ntotally extinct until an entirely new people shall have succeeded to\r\nthat which now exists. Now, it must be admitted that there is no\r\nsymptom or presage of the approach of such a revolution. There is\r\nnothing more striking to a person newly arrived in the United States,\r\nthan the kind of tumultuous agitation in which he finds political\r\nsociety. The laws are incessantly changing, and at first sight it seems\r\nimpossible that a people so variable in its desires should avoid\r\nadopting, within a short space of time, a completely new form of\r\ngovernment. Such apprehensions are, however, premature; the instability\r\nwhich affects political institutions is of two kinds, which ought not\r\nto be confounded: the first, which modifies secondary laws, is not\r\nincompatible with a very settled state of society; the other shakes the\r\nvery foundations of the Constitution, and attacks the fundamental\r\nprinciples of legislation; this species of instability is always\r\nfollowed by troubles and revolutions, and the nation which suffers\r\nunder it is in a state of violent transition.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that these two kinds of legislative instability have\r\nno necessary connection; for they have been found united or separate,\r\naccording to times and circumstances. The first is common in the United\r\nStates, but not the second: the Americans often change their laws, but\r\nthe foundation of the Constitution is respected.\r\n\r\nIn our days the republican principle rules in America, as the\r\nmonarchical principle did in France under Louis XIV. The French of that\r\nperiod were not only friends of the monarchy, but they thought it\r\nimpossible to put anything in its place; they received it as we receive\r\nthe rays of the sun and the return of the seasons. Amongst them the\r\nroyal power had neither advocates nor opponents. In like manner does\r\nthe republican government exist in America, without contention or\r\nopposition; without proofs and arguments, by a tacit agreement, a sort\r\nof consensus universalis. It is, however, my opinion that by changing\r\ntheir administrative forms as often as they do, the inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States compromise the future stability of their government.\r\n\r\nIt may be apprehended that men, perpetually thwarted in their designs\r\nby the mutability of the legislation, will learn to look upon\r\nrepublican institutions as an inconvenient form of society; the evil\r\nresulting from the instability of the secondary enactments might then\r\nraise a doubt as to the nature of the fundamental principles of the\r\nConstitution, and indirectly bring about a revolution; but this epoch\r\nis still very remote.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be foreseen even now, that when the Americans lose\r\ntheir republican institutions they will speedily arrive at a despotic\r\ngovernment, without a long interval of limited monarchy. Montesquieu\r\nremarked, that nothing is more absolute than the authority of a prince\r\nwho immediately succeeds a republic, since the powers which had\r\nfearlessly been intrusted to an elected magistrate are then transferred\r\nto a hereditary sovereign. This is true in general, but it is more\r\npeculiarly applicable to a democratic republic. In the United States,\r\nthe magistrates are not elected by a particular class of citizens, but\r\nby the majority of the nation; they are the immediate representatives\r\nof the passions of the multitude; and as they are wholly dependent upon\r\nits pleasure, they excite neither hatred nor fear: hence, as I have\r\nalready shown, very little care has been taken to limit their\r\ninfluence, and they are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary\r\npower. This state of things has engendered habits which would outlive\r\nitself; the American magistrate would retain his power, but he would\r\ncease to be responsible for the exercise of it; and it is impossible to\r\nsay what bounds could then be set to tyranny.\r\n\r\nSome of our European politicians expect to see an aristocracy arise in\r\nAmerica, and they already predict the exact period at which it will be\r\nable to assume the reins of government. I have previously observed, and\r\nI repeat my assertion, that the present tendency of American society\r\nappears to me to become more and more democratic. Nevertheless, I do\r\nnot assert that the Americans will not, at some future time, restrict\r\nthe circle of political rights in their country, or confiscate those\r\nrights to the advantage of a single individual; but I cannot imagine\r\nthat they will ever bestow the exclusive exercise of them upon a\r\nprivileged class of citizens, or, in other words, that they will ever\r\nfound an aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAn aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of citizens who,\r\nwithout being very far removed from the mass of the people, are,\r\nnevertheless, permanently stationed above it: a body which it is easy\r\nto touch and difficult to strike; with which the people are in daily\r\ncontact, but with which they can never combine. Nothing can be imagined\r\nmore contrary to nature and to the secret propensities of the human\r\nheart than a subjection of this kind; and men who are left to follow\r\ntheir own bent will always prefer the arbitrary power of a king to the\r\nregular administration of an aristocracy. Aristocratic institutions\r\ncannot subsist without laying down the inequality of men as a\r\nfundamental principle, as a part and parcel of the legislation,\r\naffecting the condition of the human family as much as it affects that\r\nof society; but these are things so repugnant to natural equity that\r\nthey can only be extorted from men by constraint.\r\n\r\nI do not think a single people can be quoted, since human society began\r\nto exist, which has, by its own free will and by its own exertions,\r\ncreated an aristocracy within its own bosom. All the aristocracies of\r\nthe Middle Ages were founded by military conquest; the conqueror was\r\nthe noble, the vanquished became the serf. Inequality was then imposed\r\nby force; and after it had been introduced into the manners of the\r\ncountry it maintained its own authority, and was sanctioned by the\r\nlegislation. Communities have existed which were aristocratic from\r\ntheir earliest origin, owing to circumstances anterior to that event,\r\nand which became more democratic in each succeeding age. Such was the\r\ndestiny of the Romans, and of the barbarians after them. But a people,\r\nhaving taken its rise in civilization and democracy, which should\r\ngradually establish an inequality of conditions, until it arrived at\r\ninviolable privileges and exclusive castes, would be a novelty in the\r\nworld; and nothing intimates that America is likely to furnish so\r\nsingular an example.\r\n\r\nReflection On The Causes Of The Commercial Prosperity Of The Of The\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nThe Americans destined by Nature to be a great maritime people\xe2\x80\x94Extent\r\nof their coasts\xe2\x80\x94Depth of their ports\xe2\x80\x94Size of their rivers\xe2\x80\x94The\r\ncommercial superiority of the Anglo-Americans less attributable,\r\nhowever, to physical circumstances than to moral and intellectual\r\ncauses\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this opinion\xe2\x80\x94Future destiny of the Anglo-Americans as\r\na commercial nation\xe2\x80\x94The dissolution of the Union would not check the\r\nmaritime vigor of the States\xe2\x80\x94Reason of this\xe2\x80\x94Anglo-Americans will\r\nnaturally supply the wants of the inhabitants of South America\xe2\x80\x94They\r\nwill become, like the English, the factors of a great portion of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe coast of the United States, from the Bay of Fundy to the Sabine\r\nRiver in the Gulf of Mexico, is more than two thousand miles in extent.\r\nThese shores form an unbroken line, and they are all subject to the\r\nsame government. No nation in the world possesses vaster, deeper, or\r\nmore secure ports for shipping than the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States constitute a great civilized\r\npeople, which fortune has placed in the midst of an uncultivated\r\ncountry at a distance of three thousand miles from the central point of\r\ncivilization. America consequently stands in daily need of European\r\ntrade. The Americans will, no doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or\r\nmanufacturing at home most of the articles which they require; but the\r\ntwo continents can never be independent of each other, so numerous are\r\nthe natural ties which exist between their wants, their ideas, their\r\nhabits, and their manners.\r\n\r\nThe Union produces peculiar commodities which are now become necessary\r\nto us, but which cannot be cultivated, or can only be raised at an\r\nenormous expense, upon the soil of Europe. The Americans only consume a\r\nsmall portion of this produce, and they are willing to sell us the\r\nrest. Europe is therefore the market of America, as America is the\r\nmarket of Europe; and maritime commerce is no less necessary to enable\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States to transport their raw materials\r\nto the ports of Europe, than it is to enable us to supply them with our\r\nmanufactured produce. The United States were therefore necessarily\r\nreduced to the alternative of increasing the business of other maritime\r\nnations to a great extent, if they had themselves declined to enter\r\ninto commerce, as the Spaniards of Mexico have hitherto done; or, in\r\nthe second place, of becoming one of the first trading powers of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans have always displayed a very decided taste for the\r\nsea. The Declaration of Independence broke the commercial restrictions\r\nwhich united them to England, and gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to\r\ntheir maritime genius. Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union\r\nhas increased in almost the same rapid proportion as the number of its\r\ninhabitants. The Americans themselves now transport to their own shores\r\nnine-tenths of the European produce which they consume. *g And they\r\nalso bring three-quarters of the exports of the New World to the\r\nEuropean consumer. *h The ships of the United States fill the docks of\r\nHavre and of Liverpool; whilst the number of English and French vessels\r\nwhich are to be seen at New York is comparatively small. *i\r\n\r\ng\r\n[ The total value of goods imported during the year which ended on\r\nSeptember 30, 1832, was $101,129,266. The value of the cargoes of\r\nforeign vessels did not amount to $10,731,039, or about one-tenth of\r\nthe entire sum.]\r\n\r\n\r\nh\r\n[ The value of goods exported during the same year amounted to\r\n$87,176,943; the value of goods exported by foreign vessels amounted to\r\n$21,036,183, or about one quarter of the whole sum. (Williams\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegister,\xe2\x80\x9d 1833, p. 398.)]\r\n\r\n\r\ni\r\n[ The tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of the Union\r\nin the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719 tons, of which\r\n544,571 tons were foreign vessels; they stood, therefore, to the\r\nAmerican vessels in a ratio of about 16 to 100. (\xe2\x80\x9cNational Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n1833, p. 304.) The tonnage of the English vessels which entered the\r\nports of London, Liverpool, and Hull, in the years 1820, 1826, and\r\n1831, amounted to 443,800 tons. The foreign vessels which entered the\r\nsame ports during the same years amounted to 159,431 tons. The ratio\r\nbetween them was, therefore, about 36 to 100. (\xe2\x80\x9cCompanion to the\r\nAlmanac,\xe2\x80\x9d 1834, p. 169.) In the year 1832 the ratio between the foreign\r\nand British ships which entered the ports of Great Britain was 29 to\r\n100. [These statements relate to a condition of affairs which has\r\nceased to exist; the Civil War and the heavy taxation of the United\r\nStates entirely altered the trade and navigation of the country.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, not only does the American merchant face the competition of his\r\nown countrymen, but he even supports that of foreign nations in their\r\nown ports with success. This is readily explained by the fact that the\r\nvessels of the United States can cross the seas at a cheaper rate than\r\nany other vessels in the world. As long as the mercantile shipping of\r\nthe United States preserves this superiority, it will not only retain\r\nwhat it has acquired, but it will constantly increase in prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races\xe2\x80\x94Part X\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can trade at a\r\nlower rate than other nations; and one is at first led to attribute\r\nthis circumstance to the physical or natural advantages which are\r\nwithin their reach; but this supposition is erroneous. The American\r\nvessels cost almost as much to build as our own; *j they are not better\r\nbuilt, and they generally last for a shorter time. The pay of the\r\nAmerican sailor is more considerable than the pay on board European\r\nships; which is proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be\r\nmet with in the merchant vessels of the United States. But I am of\r\nopinion that the true cause of their superiority must not be sought for\r\nin physical advantages, but that it is wholly attributable to their\r\nmoral and intellectual qualities.\r\n\r\nj\r\n[ Materials are, generally speaking, less expensive in America than in\r\nEurope, but the price of labor is much higher.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following comparison will illustrate my meaning. During the\r\ncampaigns of the Revolution the French introduced a new system of\r\ntactics into the art of war, which perplexed the oldest generals, and\r\nvery nearly destroyed the most ancient monarchies in Europe. They\r\nundertook (what had never before been attempted) to make shift without\r\na number of things which had always been held to be indispensable in\r\nwarfare; they required novel exertions on the part of their troops\r\nwhich no civilized nations had ever thought of; they achieved great\r\nactions in an incredibly short space of time; and they risked human\r\nlife without hesitation to obtain the object in view. The French had\r\nless money and fewer men than their enemies; their resources were\r\ninfinitely inferior; nevertheless they were constantly victorious,\r\nuntil their adversaries chose to imitate their example.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have introduced a similar system into their commercial\r\nspeculations; and they do for cheapness what the French did for\r\nconquest. The European sailor navigates with prudence; he only sets\r\nsail when the weather is favorable; if an unforseen accident befalls\r\nhim, he puts into port; at night he furls a portion of his canvas; and\r\nwhen the whitening billows intimate the vicinity of land, he checks his\r\nway, and takes an observation of the sun. But the American neglects\r\nthese precautions and braves these dangers. He weighs anchor in the\r\nmidst of tempestuous gales; by night and by day he spreads his sheets\r\nto the wind; he repairs as he goes along such damage as his vessel may\r\nhave sustained from the storm; and when he at last approaches the term\r\nof his voyage, he darts onward to the shore as if he already descried a\r\nport. The Americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader crosses the\r\nseas so rapidly. And as they perform the same distance in a shorter\r\ntime, they can perform it at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\nThe European touches several times at different ports in the course of\r\na long voyage; he loses a good deal of precious time in making the\r\nharbor, or in waiting for a favorable wind to leave it; and he pays\r\ndaily dues to be allowed to remain there. The American starts from\r\nBoston to go to purchase tea in China; he arrives at Canton, stays\r\nthere a few days, and then returns. In less than two years he has\r\nsailed as far as the entire circumference of the globe, and he has seen\r\nland but once. It is true that during a voyage of eight or ten months\r\nhe has drunk brackish water and lived upon salt meat; that he has been\r\nin a continual contest with the sea, with disease, and with a tedious\r\nexistence; but upon his return he can sell a pound of his tea for a\r\nhalf-penny less than the English merchant, and his purpose is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nI cannot better explain my meaning than by saying that the Americans\r\naffect a sort of heroism in their manner of trading. But the European\r\nmerchant will always find it very difficult to imitate his American\r\ncompetitor, who, in adopting the system which I have just described,\r\nfollows not only a calculation of his gain, but an impulse of his\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States are subject to all the wants and\r\nall the desires which result from an advanced stage of civilization;\r\nbut as they are not surrounded by a community admirably adapted, like\r\nthat of Europe, to satisfy their wants, they are often obliged to\r\nprocure for themselves the various articles which education and habit\r\nhave rendered necessaries. In America it sometimes happens that the\r\nsame individual tills his field, builds his dwelling, contrives his\r\ntools, makes his shoes, and weaves the coarse stuff of which his dress\r\nis composed. This circumstance is prejudicial to the excellence of the\r\nwork; but it powerfully contributes to awaken the intelligence of the\r\nworkman. Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of\r\nthe faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor. In a\r\ncountry like America, where men devoted to special occupations are\r\nrare, a long apprenticeship cannot be required from anyone who embraces\r\na profession. The Americans, therefore, change their means of gaining a\r\nlivelihood very readily; and they suit their occupations to the\r\nexigencies of the moment, in the manner most profitable to themselves.\r\nMen are to be met with who have successively been barristers, farmers,\r\nmerchants, ministers of the gospel, and physicians. If the American be\r\nless perfect in each craft than the European, at least there is\r\nscarcely any trade with which he is utterly unacquainted. His capacity\r\nis more general, and the circle of his intelligence is enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the United States are never fettered by the axioms\r\nof their profession; they escape from all the prejudices of their\r\npresent station; they are not more attached to one line of operation\r\nthan to another; they are not more prone to employ an old method than a\r\nnew one; they have no rooted habits, and they easily shake off the\r\ninfluence which the habits of other nations might exercise upon their\r\nminds from a conviction that their country is unlike any other, and\r\nthat its situation is without a precedent in the world. America is a\r\nland of wonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every\r\nmovement seems an improvement. The idea of novelty is there\r\nindissolubly connected with the idea of amelioration. No natural\r\nboundary seems to be set to the efforts of man; and what is not yet\r\ndone is only what he has not yet attempted to do.\r\n\r\nThis perpetual change which goes on in the United States, these\r\nfrequent vicissitudes of fortune, accompanied by such unforeseen\r\nfluctuations in private and in public wealth, serve to keep the minds\r\nof the citizens in a perpetual state of feverish agitation, which\r\nadmirably invigorates their exertions, and keeps them in a state of\r\nexcitement above the ordinary level of mankind. The whole life of an\r\nAmerican is passed like a game of chance, a revolutionary crisis, or a\r\nbattle. As the same causes are continually in operation throughout the\r\ncountry, they ultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the national\r\ncharacter. The American, taken as a chance specimen of his countrymen,\r\nmust then be a man of singular warmth in his desires, enterprising,\r\nfond of adventure, and, above all, of innovation. The same bent is\r\nmanifest in all that he does; he introduces it into his political laws,\r\nhis religious doctrines, his theories of social economy, and his\r\ndomestic occupations; he bears it with him in the depths of the\r\nbackwoods, as well as in the business of the city. It is this same\r\npassion, applied to maritime commerce, which makes him the cheapest and\r\nthe quickest trader in the world.\r\n\r\nAs long as the sailors of the United States retain these inspiriting\r\nadvantages, and the practical superiority which they derive from them,\r\nthey will not only continue to supply the wants of the producers and\r\nconsumers of their own country, but they will tend more and more to\r\nbecome, like the English, the factors of all other peoples. *k This\r\nprediction has already begun to be realized; we perceive that the\r\nAmerican traders are introducing themselves as intermediate agents in\r\nthe commerce of several European nations; *l and America will offer a\r\nstill wider field to their enterprise.\r\n\r\nk\r\n[ It must not be supposed that English vessels are exclusively employed\r\nin transporting foreign produce into England, or British produce to\r\nforeign countries; at the present day the merchant shipping of England\r\nmay be regarded in the light of a vast system of public conveyances,\r\nready to serve all the producers of the world, and to open\r\ncommunications between all peoples. The maritime genius of the\r\nAmericans prompts them to enter into competition with the English.]\r\n\r\n\r\nl\r\n[ Part of the commerce of the Mediterranean is already carried on by\r\nAmerican vessels.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great colonies which were founded in South America by the Spaniards\r\nand the Portuguese have since become empires. Civil war and oppression\r\nnow lay waste those extensive regions. Population does not increase,\r\nand the thinly scattered inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares\r\nof self-defense even to attempt any amelioration of their condition.\r\nSuch, however, will not always be the case. Europe has succeeded by her\r\nown efforts in piercing the gloom of the Middle Ages; South America has\r\nthe same Christian laws and Christian manners as we have; she contains\r\nall the germs of civilization which have grown amidst the nations of\r\nEurope or their offsets, added to the advantages to be derived from our\r\nexample: why then should she always remain uncivilized? It is clear\r\nthat the question is simply one of time; at some future period, which\r\nmay be more or less remote, the inhabitants of South America will\r\nconstitute flourishing and enlightened nations.\r\n\r\nBut when the Spaniards and Portuguese of South America begin to feel\r\nthe wants common to all civilized nations, they will still be unable to\r\nsatisfy those wants for themselves; as the youngest children of\r\ncivilization, they must perforce admit the superiority of their elder\r\nbrethren. They will be agriculturists long before they succeed in\r\nmanufactures or commerce, and they will require the mediation of\r\nstrangers to exchange their produce beyond seas for those articles for\r\nwhich a demand will begin to be felt.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that the Americans of the North will one day\r\nsupply the wants of the Americans of the South. Nature has placed them\r\nin contiguity, and has furnished the former with every means of knowing\r\nand appreciating those demands, of establishing a permanent connection\r\nwith those States, and of gradually filling their markets. The\r\nmerchants of the United States could only forfeit these natural\r\nadvantages if he were very inferior to the merchant of Europe; to whom\r\nhe is, on the contrary, superior in several respects. The Americans of\r\nthe United States already exercise a very considerable moral influence\r\nupon all the peoples of the New World. They are the source of\r\nintelligence, and all the nations which inhabit the same continent are\r\nalready accustomed to consider them as the most enlightened, the most\r\npowerful, and the most wealthy members of the great American family.\r\nAll eyes are therefore turned towards the Union; and the States of\r\nwhich that body is composed are the models which the other communities\r\ntry to imitate to the best of their power; it is from the United States\r\nthat they borrow their political principles and their laws.\r\n\r\nThe Americans of the United States stand in precisely the same position\r\nwith regard to the peoples of South America as their fathers, the\r\nEnglish, occupy with regard to the Italians, the Spaniards, the\r\nPortuguese, and all those nations of Europe which receive their\r\narticles of daily consumption from England, because they are less\r\nadvanced in civilization and trade. England is at this time the natural\r\nemporium of almost all the nations which are within its reach; the\r\nAmerican Union will perform the same part in the other hemisphere; and\r\nevery community which is founded, or which prospers in the New World,\r\nis founded and prospers to the advantage of the Anglo-Americans.\r\n\r\nIf the Union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the States which now\r\ncompose it would undoubtedly be checked for a time; but this\r\nconsequence would be less perceptible than is generally supposed. It is\r\nevident that, whatever may happen, the commercial States will remain\r\nunited. They are all contiguous to each other; they have identically\r\nthe same opinions, interests, and manners; and they are alone competent\r\nto form a very great maritime power. Even if the South of the Union\r\nwere to become independent of the North, it would still require the\r\nservices of those States. I have already observed that the South is not\r\na commercial country, and nothing intimates that it is likely to become\r\nso. The Americans of the South of the United States will therefore be\r\nobliged, for a long time to come, to have recourse to strangers to\r\nexport their produce, and to supply them with the commodities which are\r\nrequisite to satisfy their wants. But the Northern States are\r\nundoubtedly able to act as their intermediate agents cheaper than any\r\nother merchants. They will therefore retain that employment, for\r\ncheapness is the sovereign law of commerce. National claims and\r\nnational prejudices cannot resist the influence of cheapness. Nothing\r\ncan be more virulent than the hatred which exists between the Americans\r\nof the United States and the English. But notwithstanding these\r\ninimical feelings, the Americans derive the greater part of their\r\nmanufactured commodities from England, because England supplies them at\r\na cheaper rate than any other nation. Thus the increasing prosperity of\r\nAmerica turns, notwithstanding the grudges of the Americans, to the\r\nadvantage of British manufactures.\r\n\r\nReason shows and experience proves that no commercial prosperity can be\r\ndurable if it cannot be united, in case of need, to naval force. This\r\ntruth is as well understood in the United States as it can be anywhere\r\nelse: the Americans are already able to make their flag respected; in a\r\nfew years they will be able to make it feared. I am convinced that the\r\ndismemberment of the Union would not have the effect of diminishing the\r\nnaval power of the Americans, but that it would powerfully contribute\r\nto increase it. At the present time the commercial States are connected\r\nwith others which have not the same interests, and which frequently\r\nyield an unwilling consent to the increase of a maritime power by which\r\nthey are only indirectly benefited. If, on the contrary, the commercial\r\nStates of the Union formed one independent nation, commerce would\r\nbecome the foremost of their national interests; they would\r\nconsequently be willing to make very great sacrifices to protect their\r\nshipping, and nothing would prevent them from pursuing their designs\r\nupon this point.\r\n\r\nNations, as well as men, almost always betray the most prominent\r\nfeatures of their future destiny in their earliest years. When I\r\ncontemplate the ardor with which the Anglo-Americans prosecute\r\ncommercial enterprise, the advantages which befriend them, and the\r\nsuccess of their undertakings, I cannot refrain from believing that\r\nthey will one day become the first maritime power of the globe. They\r\nare born to rule the seas, as the Romans were to conquer the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry; hitherto, in\r\nspeaking of the future destiny of the United States, I have endeavored\r\nto divide my subject into distinct portions, in order to study each of\r\nthem with more attention. My present object is to embrace the whole\r\nfrom one single point; the remarks I shall make will be less detailed,\r\nbut they will be more sure. I shall perceive each object less\r\ndistinctly, but I shall descry the principal facts with more certainty.\r\nA traveller who has just left the walls of an immense city, climbs the\r\nneighboring hill; as he goes father off he loses sight of the men whom\r\nhe has so recently quitted; their dwellings are confused in a dense\r\nmass; he can no longer distinguish the public squares, and he can\r\nscarcely trace out the great thoroughfares; but his eye has less\r\ndifficulty in following the boundaries of the city, and for the first\r\ntime he sees the shape of the vast whole. Such is the future destiny of\r\nthe British race in North America to my eye; the details of the\r\nstupendous picture are overhung with shade, but I conceive a clear idea\r\nof the entire subject.\r\n\r\nThe territory now occupied or possessed by the United States of America\r\nforms about one-twentieth part of the habitable earth. But extensive as\r\nthese confines are, it must not be supposed that the Anglo-American\r\nrace will always remain within them; indeed, it has already far\r\noverstepped them.\r\n\r\nThere was once a time at which we also might have created a great\r\nFrench nation in the American wilds, to counterbalance the influence of\r\nthe English upon the destinies of the New World. France formerly\r\npossessed a territory in North America, scarcely less extensive than\r\nthe whole of Europe. The three greatest rivers of that continent then\r\nflowed within her dominions. The Indian tribes which dwelt between the\r\nmouth of the St. Lawrence and the delta of the Mississippi were\r\nunaccustomed to any other tongue but ours; and all the European\r\nsettlements scattered over that immense region recalled the traditions\r\nof our country. Louisbourg, Montmorency, Duquesne, St. Louis,\r\nVincennes, New Orleans (for such were the names they bore) are words\r\ndear to France and familiar to our ears.\r\n\r\nBut a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious to\r\nenumerate, *m have deprived us of this magnificent inheritance.\r\nWherever the French settlers were numerically weak and partially\r\nestablished, they have disappeared: those who remain are collected on a\r\nsmall extent of country, and are now subject to other laws. The 400,000\r\nFrench inhabitants of Lower Canada constitute, at the present time, the\r\nremnant of an old nation lost in the midst of a new people. A foreign\r\npopulation is increasing around them unceasingly and on all sides,\r\nwhich already penetrates amongst the ancient masters of the country,\r\npredominates in their cities and corrupts their language. This\r\npopulation is identical with that of the United States; it is therefore\r\nwith truth that I asserted that the British race is not confined within\r\nthe frontiers of the Union, since it already extends to the northeast.\r\n\r\nm\r\n[ The foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which are\r\naccustomed to free institutions and municipal government are better\r\nable than any others to found prosperous colonies. The habit of\r\nthinking and governing for oneself is indispensable in a new country,\r\nwhere success necessarily depends, in a great measure, upon the\r\nindividual exertions of the settlers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insignificant\r\nRussian settlements; but to the southwest, Mexico presents a barrier to\r\nthe Anglo-Americans. Thus, the Spaniards and the Anglo-Americans are,\r\nproperly speaking, the only two races which divide the possession of\r\nthe New World. The limits of separation between them have been settled\r\nby a treaty; but although the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly\r\nfavorable to the Anglo-Americans, I do not doubt that they will shortly\r\ninfringe this arrangement. Vast provinces, extending beyond the\r\nfrontiers of the Union towards Mexico, are still destitute of\r\ninhabitants. The natives of the United States will forestall the\r\nrightful occupants of these solitary regions. They will take possession\r\nof the soil, and establish social institutions, so that when the legal\r\nowner arrives at length, he will find the wilderness under cultivation,\r\nand strangers quietly settled in the midst of his inheritance. *n\r\n\r\nn\r\n[ [This was speedily accomplished, and ere long both Texas and\r\nCalifornia formed part of the United States. The Russian settlements\r\nwere acquired by purchase.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lands of the New World belong to the first occupant, and they are\r\nthe natural reward of the swiftest pioneer. Even the countries which\r\nare already peopled will have some difficulty in securing themselves\r\nfrom this invasion. I have already alluded to what is taking place in\r\nthe province of Texas. The inhabitants of the United States are\r\nperpetually migrating to Texas, where they purchase land; and although\r\nthey conform to the laws of the country, they are gradually founding\r\nthe empire of their own language and their own manners. The province of\r\nTexas is still part of the Mexican dominions, but it will soon contain\r\nno Mexicans; the same thing has occurred whenever the Anglo-Americans\r\nhave come into contact with populations of a different origin.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the British race has acquired an amazing\r\npreponderance over all the other European races in the New World; and\r\nthat it is very superior to them in civilization, in industry, and in\r\npower. As long as it is only surrounded by desert or thinly peopled\r\ncountries, as long as it encounters no dense populations upon its\r\nroute, through which it cannot work its way, it will assuredly continue\r\nto spread. The lines marked out by treaties will not stop it; but it\r\nwill everywhere transgress these imaginary barriers.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the British race in the New World is\r\npeculiarly favorable to its rapid increase. Above its northern\r\nfrontiers the icy regions of the Pole extend; and a few degrees below\r\nits southern confines lies the burning climate of the Equator. The\r\nAnglo-Americans are, therefore, placed in the most temperate and\r\nhabitable zone of the continent.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the prodigious increase of population in\r\nthe United States is posterior to their Declaration of Independence.\r\nBut this is an error: the population increased as rapidly under the\r\ncolonial system as it does at the present day; that is to say, it\r\ndoubled in about twenty-two years. But this proportion which is now\r\napplied to millions, was then applied to thousands of inhabitants; and\r\nthe same fact which was scarcely noticeable a century ago, is now\r\nevident to every observer.\r\n\r\nThe British subjects in Canada, who are dependent on a king, augment\r\nand spread almost as rapidly as the British settlers of the United\r\nStates, who live under a republican government. During the war of\r\nindependence, which lasted eight years, the population continued to\r\nincrease without intermission in the same ratio. Although powerful\r\nIndian nations allied with the English existed at that time upon the\r\nwestern frontiers, the emigration westward was never checked. Whilst\r\nthe enemy laid waste the shores of the Atlantic, Kentucky, the western\r\nparts of Pennsylvania, and the States of Vermont and of Maine were\r\nfilling with inhabitants. Nor did the unsettled state of the\r\nConstitution, which succeeded the war, prevent the increase of the\r\npopulation, or stop its progress across the wilds. Thus, the difference\r\nof laws, the various conditions of peace and war, of order and of\r\nanarchy, have exercised no perceptible influence upon the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the Anglo-Americans. This may be readily understood; for\r\nthe fact is, that no causes are sufficiently general to exercise a\r\nsimultaneous influence over the whole of so extensive a territory. One\r\nportion of the country always offers a sure retreat from the calamities\r\nwhich afflict another part; and however great may be the evil, the\r\nremedy which is at hand is greater still.\r\n\r\nIt must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the British race in\r\nthe New World can be arrested. The dismemberment of the Union, and the\r\nhostilities which might ensure, the abolition of republican\r\ninstitutions, and the tyrannical government which might succeed it, may\r\nretard this impulse, but they cannot prevent it from ultimately\r\nfulfilling the destinies to which that race is reserved. No power upon\r\nearth can close upon the emigrants that fertile wilderness which offers\r\nresources to all industry, and a refuge from all want. Future events,\r\nof whatever nature they may be, will not deprive the Americans of their\r\nclimate or of their inland seas, of their great rivers or of their\r\nexuberant soil. Nor will bad laws, revolutions, and anarchy be able to\r\nobliterate that love of prosperity and that spirit of enterprise which\r\nseem to be the distinctive characteristics of their race, or to\r\nextinguish that knowledge which guides them on their way.\r\n\r\nThus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure.\r\nAt a period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the\r\nlife of a nation), the Anglo-Americans will alone cover the immense\r\nspace contained between the polar regions and the tropics, extending\r\nfrom the coasts of the Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The\r\nterritory which will probably be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at\r\nsome future time, may be computed to equal three-quarters of Europe in\r\nextent. *o The climate of the Union is upon the whole preferable to\r\nthat of Europe, and its natural advantages are not less great; it is\r\ntherefore evident that its population will at some future time be\r\nproportionate to our own. Europe, divided as it is between so many\r\ndifferent nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars and the\r\nbarbarous manners of the Middle Ages, has notwithstanding attained a\r\npopulation of 410 inhabitants to the square league. *p What cause can\r\nprevent the United States from having as numerous a population in time?\r\n\r\no\r\n[ The United States already extend over a territory equal to one-half\r\nof Europe. The area of Europe is 500,000 square leagues, and its\r\npopulation 205,000,000 of inhabitants. (\xe2\x80\x9cMalte Brun,\xe2\x80\x9d liv. 114. vol.\r\nvi. p. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[This computation is given in French leagues, which were in use when\r\nthe author wrote. Twenty years later, in 1850, the superficial area of\r\nthe United States had been extended to 3,306,865 square miles of\r\nterritory, which is about the area of Europe.]]\r\n\r\np\r\n[ See \xe2\x80\x9cMalte Brun,\xe2\x80\x9d liv. 116, vol. vi. p. 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany ages must elapse before the divers offsets of the British race in\r\nAmerica cease to present the same homogeneous characteristics: and the\r\ntime cannot be foreseen at which a permanent inequality of conditions\r\nwill be established in the New World. Whatever differences may arise,\r\nfrom peace or from war, from freedom or oppression, from prosperity or\r\nwant, between the destinies of the different descendants of the great\r\nAnglo-American family, they will at least preserve an analogous social\r\ncondition, and they will hold in common the customs and the opinions to\r\nwhich that social condition has given birth.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, the tie of religion was sufficiently powerful to\r\nimbue all the different populations of Europe with the same\r\ncivilization. The British of the New World have a thousand other\r\nreciprocal ties; and they live at a time when the tendency to equality\r\nis general amongst mankind. The Middle Ages were a period when\r\neverything was broken up; when each people, each province, each city,\r\nand each family, had a strong tendency to maintain its distinct\r\nindividuality. At the present time an opposite tendency seems to\r\nprevail, and the nations seem to be advancing to unity. Our means of\r\nintellectual intercourse unite the most remote parts of the earth; and\r\nit is impossible for men to remain strangers to each other, or to be\r\nignorant of the events which are taking place in any corner of the\r\nglobe. The consequence is that there is less difference, at the present\r\nday, between the Europeans and their descendants in the New World, than\r\nthere was between certain towns in the thirteenth century which were\r\nonly separated by a river. If this tendency to assimilation brings\r\nforeign nations closer to each other, it must a fortiori prevent the\r\ndescendants of the same people from becoming aliens to each other.\r\n\r\nThe time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men\r\nwill be living in North America, *q equal in condition, the progeny of\r\none race, owing their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same\r\ncivilization, the same language, the same religion, the same habits,\r\nthe same manners, and imbued with the same opinions, propagated under\r\nthe same forms. The rest is uncertain, but this is certain; and it is a\r\nfact new to the world\xe2\x80\x94a fact fraught with such portentous consequences\r\nas to baffle the efforts even of the imagination.\r\n\r\nq\r\n[ This would be a population proportionate to that of Europe, taken at\r\na mean rate of 410 inhabitants to the square league.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, at the present time, two great nations in the world which\r\nseem to tend towards the same end, although they started from different\r\npoints: I allude to the Russians and the Americans. Both of them have\r\ngrown up unnoticed; and whilst the attention of mankind was directed\r\nelsewhere, they have suddenly assumed a most prominent place amongst\r\nthe nations; and the world learned their existence and their greatness\r\nat almost the same time.\r\n\r\nAll other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural limits, and\r\nonly to be charged with the maintenance of their power; but these are\r\nstill in the act of growth; *r all the others are stopped, or continue\r\nto advance with extreme difficulty; these are proceeding with ease and\r\nwith celerity along a path to which the human eye can assign no term.\r\nThe American struggles against the natural obstacles which oppose him;\r\nthe adversaries of the Russian are men; the former combats the\r\nwilderness and savage life; the latter, civilization with all its\r\nweapons and its arts: the conquests of the one are therefore gained by\r\nthe ploughshare; those of the other by the sword. The Anglo-American\r\nrelies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends, and gives free\r\nscope to the unguided exertions and common-sense of the citizens; the\r\nRussian centres all the authority of society in a single arm: the\r\nprincipal instrument of the former is freedom; of the latter servitude.\r\nTheir starting-point is different, and their courses are not the same;\r\nyet each of them seems to be marked out by the will of Heaven to sway\r\nthe destinies of half the globe.\r\n\r\nr\r\n[ Russia is the country in the Old World in which population increases\r\nmost rapidly in proportion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
