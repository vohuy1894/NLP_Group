MYRIEL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1815, M. Charles-Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 He was\r\nan old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see\r\nof D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 since 1806.\r\n\r\nAlthough this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance\r\nof what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely\r\nfor the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various\r\nrumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the\r\nvery moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which\r\nis said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and\r\nabove all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the\r\nson of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the\r\nnobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be\r\nthe heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen\r\nor twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent\r\nin parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was\r\nsaid that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well\r\nformed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent;\r\nthe whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the\r\nworld and to gallantry.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation;\r\nthe parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were\r\ndispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning\r\nof the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from\r\nwhich she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next\r\nin the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden\r\ndays, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of \xe2\x80\x9993, which\r\nwere, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from\r\na distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,\xe2\x80\x94did these cause the\r\nideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the\r\nmidst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life,\r\nsuddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which\r\nsometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public\r\ncatastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his\r\nfortune? No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he\r\nreturned from Italy he was a priest.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, M. Myriel was the Cur\xc3\xa9 of B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 [Brignolles]. He was already\r\nadvanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\r\n\r\nAbout the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his\r\ncuracy\xe2\x80\x94just what, is not precisely known\xe2\x80\x94took him to Paris. Among other\r\npowerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners\r\nwas M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had come to visit\r\nhis uncle, the worthy Cur\xc3\xa9, who was waiting in the anteroom, found\r\nhimself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself\r\nobserved with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and\r\nsaid abruptly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this good man who is staring at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Myriel, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are looking at a good man, and I at a\r\ngreat man. Each of us can profit by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cur\xc3\xa9,\r\nand some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that\r\nhe had been appointed Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as\r\nto the early portion of M. Myriel\xe2\x80\x99s life? No one knew. Very few\r\nfamilies had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nM. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,\r\nwhere there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.\r\nHe was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he\r\nwas a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was\r\nconnected were rumors only,\xe2\x80\x94noise, sayings, words; less than\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94_palabres_, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of\r\nresidence in D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, all the stories and subjects of conversation which\r\nengross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into\r\nprofound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one\r\nwould have dared to recall them.\r\n\r\nM. Myriel had arrived at D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 accompanied by an elderly spinster,\r\nMademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\r\n\r\nTheir only domestic was a female servant of the same age as\r\nMademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having\r\nbeen _the servant of M. le Cur\xc3\xa9_, now assumed the double title of maid\r\nto Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she\r\nrealized the ideal expressed by the word \xe2\x80\x9crespectable\xe2\x80\x9d; for it seems\r\nthat a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had\r\nnever been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a\r\nsuccession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of\r\npallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired\r\nwhat may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in\r\nher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\r\nallowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her\r\nperson seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to\r\nprovide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever\r\ndrooping;\xe2\x80\x94a mere pretext for a soul\xe2\x80\x99s remaining on the earth.\r\n\r\nMadame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\r\nbustling; always out of breath,\xe2\x80\x94in the first place, because of her\r\nactivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with\r\nthe honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop\r\nimmediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the\r\nfirst call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general\r\nand the prefect.\r\n\r\nThe installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\xe2\x80\x94M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe episcopal palace of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 adjoins the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at\r\nthe beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology\r\nof the Faculty of Paris, Abb\xc3\xa9 of Simore, who had been Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 in\r\n1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about\r\nit had a grand air,\xe2\x80\x94the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,\r\nthe chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks\r\nencircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens\r\nplanted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb\r\ngallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the\r\ngardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My\r\nLords Charles Br\xc3\xbblart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d\xe2\x80\x99Embrun; Antoine\r\nde Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vend\xc3\xb4me,\r\nGrand Prior of France, Abb\xc3\xa9 of Saint Honor\xc3\xa9 de L\xc3\xa9rins; Fran\xc3\xa7ois de\r\nBerton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; C\xc3\xa9sar de Sabran de\r\nForcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Gland\xc3\xa8ve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of\r\nthe Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of\r\nSenez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this\r\napartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there\r\nengraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.\r\n\r\nThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a\r\nsmall garden.\r\n\r\nThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The\r\nvisit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur the director of the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to him, \xe2\x80\x9chow many sick\r\npeople have you at the present moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-six, Monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the number which I counted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe beds,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the director, \xe2\x80\x9care very much crowded against each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I observed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the\r\nair can be changed in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it seems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the\r\nconvalescents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what I said to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn case of epidemics,\xe2\x80\x94we have had the typhus fever this year; we had\r\nthe sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at\r\ntimes,\xe2\x80\x94we know not what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the thought which occurred to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have, Monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d said the director. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must resign\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the\r\ndirector of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chow many beds do you think this hall alone would\r\nhold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur\xe2\x80\x99s dining-room?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the stupefied director.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking\r\nmeasures and calculations with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would hold full twenty beds,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as though speaking to\r\nhimself. Then, raising his voice:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you\r\nsomething. There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of\r\nyou, in five or six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we\r\nhave room for sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my\r\nhouse, and I have yours. Give me back my house; you are at home here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the\r\nBishop\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\r\n\r\nM. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the\r\nRevolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five\r\nhundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.\r\nM. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary\r\nof fifteen thousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode\r\nin the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once\r\nfor all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his\r\nown hand:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.\r\n\r\nFor the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500 livres\r\nSociety of the  mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      100   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For the Lazarists of Montdidier . . . . . . . . . .      100   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Seminary for foreign missions in Paris  . . . . . .      200   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Congregation of the Holy Spirit . . . . . . . . . .      150   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Religious establishments of the Holy Land . . . . .      100   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Charitable maternity societies  . . . . . . . . . .      300   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Extra, for that of Arles  . . . . . . . . . . . . .       50   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Work for the amelioration of prisons  . . . . . . .      400   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Work for the relief and delivery of prisoners . . .      500   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n To liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt  1,000   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the\r\ndiocese  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    2,000   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Public granary of the Hautes-Alpes  . . . . . . . .      100   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Congregation of the ladies of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, of Manosque, and of\r\nSisteron, for the gratuitous instruction of poor\r\ngirls  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For the poor  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    6,000   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n My personal expenses  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,000   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nTotal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   15,000   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period\r\nthat he occupied the see of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 As has been seen, he called it\r\n_regulating his household expenses_.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle\r\nBaptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 as at one and\r\nthe same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the\r\nflesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and\r\nvenerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her\r\nadherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It\r\nwill be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only\r\none thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle\r\nBaptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen\r\nhundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\r\n\r\nAnd when a village curate came to D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, the Bishop still found means to\r\nentertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to\r\nthe intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\r\n\r\nOne day, after he had been in D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 about three months, the Bishop said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd still I am quite cramped with it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame Magloire. \xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur has not\r\neven claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the\r\nexpense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the\r\ndiocese. It was customary for bishops in former days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are quite right, Madame Magloire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he made his demand.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under\r\nconsideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs,\r\nunder this heading: _Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of\r\ncarriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits._\r\n\r\nThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator\r\nof the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which\r\nfavored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent\r\nsenatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, wrote to M. Bigot\r\nde Pr\xc3\xa9ameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and\r\nconfidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic\r\nlines:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExpenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than\r\nfour thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use of\r\nthese trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be\r\naccomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one\r\ntravels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance\r\nand Ch\xc3\xa2teau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all\r\nthus, greedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when he\r\nfirst came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a\r\nposting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden\r\ndays. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte,\r\nuntil the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down\r\nwith the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part,\r\nI am for C\xc3\xa6sar alone.\xe2\x80\x9d Etc., etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame\r\nMagloire. \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; \xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur\r\nbegan with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after\r\nall. He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand\r\nfrancs for us! At last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a\r\nmemorandum conceived in the following terms:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nEXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.\r\n\r\nFor furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres\r\nFor the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . .   250   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan  . . .   250   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For foundlings  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For orphans   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-\r\nTotal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000   \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was M. Myriel\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\r\n\r\nAs for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans,\r\ndispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or\r\nchapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with\r\nall the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who\r\nlacked knocked at M. Myriel\xe2\x80\x99s door,\xe2\x80\x94the latter in search of the alms\r\nwhich the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had\r\nbecome the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in\r\ndistress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but\r\nnothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of\r\nlife, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.\r\n\r\nFar from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there is\r\nbrotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was\r\nreceived. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he\r\nreceived, he never had any. Then he stripped himself.\r\n\r\nThe usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at\r\nthe head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people\r\nof the country-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct,\r\namong the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning\r\nfor them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur\r\nBienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call\r\nhim thus when we have occasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation\r\npleased him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that name,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we\r\nconfine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\xe2\x80\x94A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted\r\nhis carriage into alms. The diocese of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 is a fatiguing one. There\r\nare very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we\r\nhave just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two\r\nhundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite\r\na task.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the\r\nneighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on\r\na donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the\r\ntrip was too hard for them, he went alone.\r\n\r\nOne day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was\r\nmounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did\r\nnot permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to\r\nreceive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his\r\nass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur the Mayor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cand Messieurs Citizens, I\r\nperceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest\r\nto ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from\r\nnecessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked\r\nrather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and\r\nhis examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example\r\nof a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the\r\npoor, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the people of Brian\xc3\xa7on! They have conferred on\r\nthe poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown\r\nthree days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for\r\nthem gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which\r\nis blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single\r\nmurderer among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nthe people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family\r\nhas his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service\r\nin the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cur\xc3\xa9 recommends\r\nhim to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass,\r\nall the inhabitants of the village\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and children\xe2\x80\x94go to the\r\npoor man\xe2\x80\x99s field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and\r\nhis grain to his granary.\xe2\x80\x9d To families divided by questions of money\r\nand inheritance he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the mountaineers of Devolny, a\r\ncountry so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty\r\nyears. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek\r\ntheir fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may\r\nfind husbands.\xe2\x80\x9d To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and\r\nwhere the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nthose good peasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand\r\nsouls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge\r\nnor bailiff is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the\r\nimposts, taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for\r\nnothing, divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences\r\ngratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more\r\nthe people of Queyras: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how they manage?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSince a\r\nlittle country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a\r\nteacher, they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley, who\r\nmake the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days\r\nin that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen\r\nthem there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear\r\nin the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen;\r\nthose who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach\r\nreading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to\r\nbe ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he\r\ninvented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and\r\nmany images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus\r\nChrist. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\xe2\x80\x94WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nHis conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with\r\nthe two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he\r\nlaughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call\r\nhim Your Grace [_Votre Grandeur_]. One day he rose from his armchair,\r\nand went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of\r\nthe upper shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could\r\nnot reach it. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Magloire,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfetch me a chair. My\r\ngreatness [_grandeur_] does not reach as far as that shelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de L\xc3\xb4, rarely allowed\r\nan opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she\r\ndesignated as \xe2\x80\x9cthe expectations\xe2\x80\x9d of her three sons. She had numerous\r\nrelatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons\r\nwere the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a\r\ngrandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the\r\nheir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to\r\nsucceed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to\r\nlisten in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On\r\none occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual,\r\nwhile Madame de L\xc3\xb4 was relating once again the details of all these\r\ninheritances and all these \xe2\x80\x9cexpectations.\xe2\x80\x9d She interrupted herself\r\nimpatiently: \xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nthinking,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cof a singular remark, which is to be\r\nfound, I believe, in St. Augustine,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Place your hopes in the man from\r\nwhom you do not inherit.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a\r\ngentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the\r\ndead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his\r\nrelatives, spread over an entire page: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stout back Death has!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on\r\nhim, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb\r\ninto the service of vanity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always\r\nconcealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful\r\nvicar came to D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably\r\neloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to\r\ngive to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most\r\nfrightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he\r\nrepresented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a\r\nwealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M.\r\nG\xc3\xa9borand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse\r\ncloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M.\r\nG\xc3\xa9borand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that\r\nsermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old\r\nbeggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to\r\nshare it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of\r\nbestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nM. G\xc3\xa9borand purchasing paradise for a sou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a\r\nrefusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which\r\ninduced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room\r\nof the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy\r\nand avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time,\r\nan ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has\r\nactually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm,\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give me something, M. le Marquis.\xe2\x80\x9d_ The Marquis turned round\r\nand answered dryly, _\xe2\x80\x9cI have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nthem to me,\xe2\x80\x9d_ replied the Bishop.\r\n\r\nOne day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand peasants\xe2\x80\x99 dwellings in France which have but three\r\nopenings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but\r\ntwo openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six\r\nthousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this\r\narises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just\r\nput poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings,\r\nand behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to\r\nmen; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.\r\nIn the department of the Is\xc3\xa8re, in the Var, in the two departments of\r\nthe Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even\r\nwheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they\r\nhave no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped\r\nin pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the\r\nhilly country of Dauphin\xc3\xa9. They make bread for six months at one time;\r\nthey bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread\r\nup with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to\r\nrender it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all\r\nsides of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn a Proven\xc3\xa7al, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of\r\nthe south. He said, _\xe2\x80\x9cEn b\xc3\xa9! moussu, s\xc3\xa9s sag\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d_ as in lower Languedoc;\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cOnt\xc3\xa9 anaras passa?\xe2\x80\x9d_ as in the Basses-Alpes; _\xe2\x80\x9cPuerte un bouen moutu\r\nembe un bouen fromage grase,\xe2\x80\x9d_ as in upper Dauphin\xc3\xa9. This pleased the\r\npeople extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all\r\nspirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the\r\nmountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most\r\nvulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the\r\nlower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking\r\ncircumstances into account. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cExamine the road over which the\r\nfault has passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing, as he described himself with a smile, an _ex-sinner_, he had\r\nnone of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal\r\nof distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a\r\ndoctrine which may be summed up as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his\r\ntemptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it,\r\ncheck it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may\r\nbe some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is\r\nvenial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,\r\nfall, sin if you will, but be upright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream\r\nof the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a\r\ngravitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very\r\nquickly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x9cto all appearance, this is a\r\ngreat crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies which\r\nhave taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put\r\nthemselves under shelter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of\r\nhuman society rest. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe faults of women, of children, of the\r\nfeeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands,\r\nthe fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cTeach those who are ignorant as many things as\r\npossible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction\r\ngratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is\r\nfull of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the\r\nperson who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the\r\nshadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of\r\njudging things: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.\r\n\r\nOne day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the\r\npoint of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at\r\nthe end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for\r\na woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was\r\nstill punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested\r\nin the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was\r\nheld, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could\r\naccuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they\r\ninsisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to\r\nthe attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of\r\nthe lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly\r\npresented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival,\r\nand that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy,\r\nshe denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\r\n\r\nThe man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his\r\naccomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing\r\nenthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy\r\ninto play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had\r\neduced the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in\r\nsilence. When they had finished, he inquired,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are this man and woman to be tried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Court of Assizes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went on, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where will the advocate of the crown be tried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nA tragic event occurred at D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 A man was condemned to death for murder.\r\nHe was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant,\r\nwho had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public. The\r\ntown took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed\r\nfor the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell\r\nill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments.\r\nThey sent for the cur\xc3\xa9. It seems that he refused to come, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task,\r\nand with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, _\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le\r\nCur\xc3\xa9 is right: it is not his place; it is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmountebank,\xe2\x80\x9d called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to\r\nhim. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep,\r\npraying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the\r\ncondemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are also\r\nthe most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to\r\nbless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man\r\nwas on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he\r\nstood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was\r\nnot sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His\r\ncondemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken\r\nthrough, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery\r\nof things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this\r\nworld through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The\r\nBishop made him see light.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the\r\nBishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the\r\neyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross\r\nupon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\r\n\r\nHe mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The\r\nsufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day,\r\nwas radiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God.\r\nThe Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to\r\nfall, he said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cGod raises from the dead him whom man slays; he\r\nwhom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray,\r\nbelieve, enter into life: the Father is there.\xe2\x80\x9d When he descended from\r\nthe scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people\r\ndraw aside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy of\r\nadmiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble\r\ndwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as _his palace_, he said\r\nto his sister, _\xe2\x80\x9cI have just officiated pontifically.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nSince the most sublime things are often those which are the least\r\nunderstood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on\r\nthis conduct of the Bishop, _\xe2\x80\x9cIt is affectation.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThis, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms.\r\nThe populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and\r\nadmired him.\r\n\r\nAs for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,\r\nand it was a long time before he recovered from it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has\r\nsomething about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain\r\nindifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing\r\nupon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a\r\nguillotine with one\xe2\x80\x99s own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the\r\nshock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or\r\nagainst. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like\r\nBeccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called\r\n_vindicate_; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain\r\nneutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers.\r\nAll social problems erect their interrogation point around this\r\nchopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece\r\nof carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an\r\ninert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre\r\ninitiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s work saw, that\r\nthis machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood,\r\nthis iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful\r\nmeditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears\r\nin terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The\r\nscaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats\r\nflesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by\r\nthe judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a\r\nhorrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day\r\nfollowing the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop\r\nappeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal\r\nmoment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him.\r\nHe, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant\r\nsatisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to\r\nhimself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is\r\none which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: \xe2\x80\x9cI did not\r\nthink that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the\r\ndivine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs\r\nto God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.\r\nNevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided\r\npassing the place of execution.\r\n\r\nM. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and\r\ndying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty\r\nand his greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to\r\nsummon him; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down\r\nand hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife\r\nof his love, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the\r\nmoment for silence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable\r\nconsoler! He sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to\r\nmagnify and dignify it by hope. He said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think\r\nnot of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living\r\nlight of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d He knew that\r\nfaith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man,\r\nby pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief\r\nwhich gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze\r\nupon a star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\xe2\x80\x94MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his\r\npublic life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 lived,\r\nwould have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have\r\nviewed it close at hand.\r\n\r\nLike all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little.\r\nThis brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an\r\nhour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own\r\nhouse. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk\r\nof his own cows. Then he set to work.\r\n\r\nA Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary of\r\nthe bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his\r\nvicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, a\r\nwhole ecclesiastical library to examine,\xe2\x80\x94prayer-books, diocesan\r\ncatechisms, books of hours, etc.,\xe2\x80\x94charges to write, sermons to\r\nauthorize, cur\xc3\xa9s and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an\r\nadministrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the\r\nHoly See; and a thousand matters of business.\r\n\r\nWhat time was left to him, after these thousand details of business,\r\nand his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous,\r\nthe sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the\r\nafflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes\r\nhe dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one word for\r\nboth these kinds of toil; he called them _gardening_. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mind is a\r\ngarden,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nTowards midday, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a\r\nstroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He\r\nwas seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down,\r\nsupporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment\r\nof silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his\r\ncoarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden\r\ntassels of large bullion to droop from its three points.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said\r\nthat his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The\r\nchildren and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as\r\nfor the sun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They\r\npointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Comforter]\r\n\r\nHere and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and\r\nsmiled upon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any\r\nmoney; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich.\r\n\r\nAs he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it\r\nnoticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.\r\nThis inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.\r\n\r\nOn his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame\r\nMagloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could\r\nbe more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his\r\ncur\xc3\xa9s to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to\r\nserve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some\r\nfine game from the mountains. Every cur\xc3\xa9 furnished the pretext for a\r\ngood meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his\r\nordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil\r\nsoup. Thus it was said in the town, _when the Bishop does not indulge\r\nin the cheer of a cur\xc3\xa9, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist_.\r\n\r\nAfter supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine\r\nand Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to\r\nwriting, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some\r\nfolio. He was a man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him\r\nfive or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on\r\nthis verse in Genesis, _In the beginning, the spirit of God floated\r\nupon the waters_. With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic\r\nverse which says, _The winds of God blew;_ Flavius Josephus who says,\r\n_A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth;_ and finally, the\r\nChaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, _A wind coming from\r\nGod blew upon the face of the waters_. In another dissertation, he\r\nexamines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolema\xc3\xafs,\r\ngreat-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact,\r\nthat to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works\r\npublished during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might\r\nbe which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound\r\nmeditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of\r\nthe volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with\r\nthe book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written\r\nby him on the margin of a quarto entitled _Correspondence of Lord\r\nGermain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the\r\nAmerican station. Versailles, Poin\xc3\xa7ot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot,\r\nbookseller, Quai des Augustins._\r\n\r\nHere is the note:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you who are!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the\r\nCreator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls\r\nyou Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you\r\nLight; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence;\r\nLeviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man\r\ncalls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the\r\nmost beautiful of all your names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nToward nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening the two women retired and betook\r\nthemselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone\r\nuntil morning on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of\r\nthe dwelling of the Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\xe2\x80\x94WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground\r\nfloor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three\r\nchambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a\r\ngarden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the\r\nfirst floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on\r\nthe street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and\r\nthe third his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory,\r\nexcept by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without\r\npassing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the\r\noratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of\r\nhospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom\r\nbusiness or the requirements of their parishes brought to D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to\r\nthe house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a\r\nkitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a\r\nstable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in\r\nwhich the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk\r\nthey gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick\r\npeople in the hospital.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI am paying my tithes,\xe2\x80\x9d_ he said.\r\n\r\nHis bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad\r\nweather. As wood is extremely dear at D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, he hit upon the idea of\r\nhaving a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he\r\npassed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his\r\n_winter salon_.\r\n\r\nIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other\r\nfurniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated\r\nchairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an\r\nantique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar\r\nsideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the\r\nBishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\r\n\r\nHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 had more than once\r\nassessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for\r\nMonseigneur\xe2\x80\x99s oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had\r\ngiven it to the poor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most beautiful of altars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\nsoul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an\r\narmchair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received\r\nseven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the\r\nstaff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little\r\nseminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the\r\nstable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the\r\nbedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for\r\nthe visitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop\r\nthen relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front\r\nof the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it\r\nwas summer.\r\n\r\nThere was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was\r\nhalf gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service\r\nonly when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in\r\nher own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been\r\ngilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been\r\nobliged to hoist this berg\xc3\xa8re up to the first story through the window,\r\nas the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned\r\namong the possibilities in the way of furniture.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Baptistine\xe2\x80\x99s ambition had been to be able to purchase a\r\nset of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a\r\nrose pattern, and with mahogany in swan\xe2\x80\x99s neck style, with a sofa. But\r\nthis would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the\r\nfact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten\r\nsous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by\r\nrenouncing the idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?\r\n\r\nNothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the\r\nbed,\xe2\x80\x94a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the\r\nshadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet,\r\nwhich still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there\r\nwere two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the\r\nother near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was\r\na large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of\r\nwood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the\r\nchimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two\r\ngarlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with\r\nsilver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the\r\nchimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off,\r\nfixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which\r\nthe gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an\r\ninkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes;\r\nbefore the table an armchair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu,\r\nborrowed from the oratory.\r\n\r\nTwo portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of\r\nthe bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at\r\nthe side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one\r\nthe Abb\xc3\xa9 of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abb\xc3\xa9\r\nTourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abb\xc3\xa9 of Grand-Champ, order of C\xc3\xaeteaux,\r\ndiocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after\r\nthe hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left\r\nthem. They were priests, and probably donors\xe2\x80\x94two reasons for respecting\r\nthem. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been\r\nappointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his\r\nbenefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire\r\nhaving taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these\r\nparticulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper,\r\nyellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abb\xc3\xa9\r\nof Grand-Champ with four wafers.\r\n\r\nAt his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff,\r\nwhich finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a\r\nnew one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very\r\nmiddle of it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often\r\ncalled attention to it: \xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful that is!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAll the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground\r\nfloor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is\r\na fashion in barracks and hospitals.\r\n\r\nHowever, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the\r\npaper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment\r\nof Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming\r\na hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the\r\nBourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red\r\nbricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all\r\nthe beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two\r\nwomen, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole\r\nluxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, _\xe2\x80\x9cThat takes nothing from\r\nthe poor.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former\r\npossessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame\r\nMagloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened\r\nsplendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting\r\nthe Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 as he was in reality, we must add that he had said\r\nmore than once, \xe2\x80\x9cI find it difficult to renounce eating from silver\r\ndishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive\r\nsilver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks\r\nheld two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted\r\nthe two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.\r\n\r\nIn the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small\r\ncupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and\r\nforks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that\r\nthe key was never removed.\r\n\r\nThe garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which\r\nwe have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating\r\nfrom a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted\r\nthe white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four\r\nsquare plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire\r\ncultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some\r\nflowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had\r\nonce remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: \xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, you who turn\r\neverything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would\r\nbe better to grow salads there than bouquets.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Magloire,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nretorted the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as\r\nthe useful.\xe2\x80\x9d He added after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cMore so, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost\r\nas much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there,\r\ntrimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into\r\nwhich he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener\r\ncould have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to\r\nbotany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest\r\neffort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took\r\npart neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu\r\nagainst Linn\xc3\xa6us. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He\r\nrespected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more;\r\nand, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his\r\nflower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\r\n\r\nThe house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the\r\ndining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral\r\nsquare, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door\r\nof a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this\r\ndoor was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything\r\nexcept the latch. All that the first passer-by had to do at any hour,\r\nwas to give it a push. At first, the two women had been very much tried\r\nby this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 had said to\r\nthem, \xe2\x80\x9cHave bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.\xe2\x80\x9d They had\r\nended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they\r\nshared it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for\r\nthe Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated,\r\nin the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthe shade of difference: the door of the physician should never be\r\nshut, the door of the priest should always be open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOn another book, entitled _Philosophy of the Medical Science_, he had\r\nwritten this other note: \xe2\x80\x9cAm not I a physician like them? I also have\r\nmy patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of\r\nyou. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs\r\nshelter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt chanced that a worthy cur\xc3\xa9, I know not whether it was the cur\xc3\xa9 of\r\nCouloubroux or the cur\xc3\xa9 of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him\r\none day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether\r\nMonsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a\r\ncertain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the\r\nmercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he\r\ndid not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little\r\nguarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said\r\nto him, _\xe2\x80\x9cNisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui\r\ncustodiunt eam,\xe2\x80\x9d Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch\r\nwho guard it._\r\n\r\nThen he spoke of something else.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a bravery of the priest as well as the\r\nbravery of a colonel of dragoons,\xe2\x80\x94only,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cours must be\r\ntranquil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\xe2\x80\x94CRAVATTE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not\r\nomit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a\r\nman the Bishop of D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 was.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the band of Gaspard B\xc3\xa8s, who had infested the\r\ngorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in\r\nthe mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the\r\nremnant of Gaspard B\xc3\xa8s\xe2\x80\x99s troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his\r\nway to Pi\xc3\xa9dmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of\r\nBarcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid\r\nhimself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l\xe2\x80\x99Aigle, and thence he descended\r\ntowards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and\r\nUbayette.\r\n\r\nHe even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and\r\ndespoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the\r\ncountry-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He\r\nalways escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold\r\nwretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was\r\nmaking his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged\r\nhim to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains\r\nas far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it\r\nmerely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cI intend to go without escort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not really mean that, Monseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the mayor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and\r\nshall set out in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, you will not do that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere exists yonder in the mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9ca tiny\r\ncommunity no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years.\r\nThey are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own\r\none goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty\r\nwoollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on\r\nlittle flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God now\r\nand then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would\r\nthey say if I did not go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the brigands, Monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cI must think of that. You are right. I may\r\nmeet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves\r\nthat Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of\r\nProvidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will rob you, Monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers?\r\nBah! To what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should beg alms of them for my poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking your\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le maire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop, \xe2\x80\x9cis that really all? I am not in\r\nthe world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied only\r\nby a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruited\r\nabout the country-side, and caused great consternation.\r\n\r\nHe would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed the\r\nmountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound\r\nat the residence of his \xe2\x80\x9cgood friends,\xe2\x80\x9d the shepherds. He remained\r\nthere for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament,\r\nteaching, exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he\r\nresolved to chant a _Te Deum_ pontifically. He mentioned it to the\r\ncur\xc3\xa9. But what was to be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. They\r\ncould only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a\r\nfew ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bishop. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us announce our _Te Deum_ from the pulpit,\r\nnevertheless, Monsieur le Cur\xc3\xa9. Things will arrange themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the\r\nmagnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed\r\nto clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and\r\ndeposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen,\r\nwho departed on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope\r\nof cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncross, a magnificent crosier,\xe2\x80\x94all the pontifical vestments which had\r\nbeen stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written,\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid not I say that things would come right of themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nBishop. Then he added, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cTo him who contents himself with\r\nthe surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the cur\xc3\xa9, throwing back his head with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x94or the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked steadily at the cur\xc3\xa9, and repeated with authority,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as\r\nat a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest\xe2\x80\x99s house in Chastelar\r\nhe rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were\r\nwaiting for him, and he said to his sister: \xe2\x80\x9cWell! was I in the right?\r\nThe poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he\r\nreturns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith\r\nin God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us never fear\r\nrobbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers.\r\nLet us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the\r\nreal murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it\r\nwhat threatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that which\r\nthreatens our soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, turning to his sister: \xe2\x80\x9cSister, never a precaution on the part of\r\nthe priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God\r\npermits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a\r\ndanger is approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our\r\nbrother may not fall into sin on our account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of which\r\nwe know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at\r\nthe same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\r\n\r\nAs to what became of \xe2\x80\x9cthe treasure\xe2\x80\x9d of the cathedral of Embrun, we\r\nshould be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of\r\nvery handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very\r\nwell adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen\r\nthey had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed;\r\nit only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause\r\nit to take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make\r\nno assertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found\r\namong the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s papers, which may bear some relation to this matter,\r\nand which is couched in these terms, _\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, to decide\r\nwhether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the\r\nhospital.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\xe2\x80\x94PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way,\r\nheedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called\r\nconscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to his\r\ngoal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his\r\ninterest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by\r\nany means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his\r\nsons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having\r\nwisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good\r\nwindfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was\r\nintelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple\r\nof Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of\r\nPigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and\r\neternal things, and at the \xe2\x80\x9ccrotchets of that good old fellow the\r\nBishop.\xe2\x80\x9d He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in\r\nthe presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.\r\n\r\nOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what,\r\nCount
