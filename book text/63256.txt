Chui, chui, chui!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBad sparrows!\r\n\r\nMy dream was silly but splendid.\r\n\r\nDream is no dream without silliness which is akin to poetry.\r\n\r\nIf my dream ever comes true!\r\n\r\n\r\n24th\xe2\x80\x94The song of gay children scattered over the street had subsided.\r\nThe harvest moon shone like a yellow halo of \xe2\x80\x9cNono Sama.\xe2\x80\x9d All things in\r\nblessed Mitsuho No Kuni\xe2\x80\x94the smallest ant also\xe2\x80\x94bathed in sweet inspiring\r\nbeams of beauty. The soft song that is not to be heard but to be felt,\r\nwas in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas a crime, I judged, to squander lazily such a gracious graceful\r\nhour within doors.\r\n\r\nI and my maid strolled to the Konpira shrine.\r\n\r\nHer red stout fingers\xe2\x80\x94like sweet potatoes\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear so bad tonight,\r\nfor the moon beautified every ugliness.\r\n\r\nOur Emperor should proclaim forbidding woman to be out at any time\r\nexcept under the moonlight.\r\n\r\nWithout beauty woman is nothing. Face is the whole soul. I prefer death\r\nif I am not given a pair of dark velvety eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat a shame even woman must grow old!\r\n\r\nOne stupid wrinkle on my face would be enough to stun me.\r\n\r\nMy pride is in my slim fingers of satin skin.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll carefully clean my roseate finger-nails before I\xe2\x80\x99ll land in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nOur wooden clogs sounded melodious, like a rhythmic prayer unto the sky.\r\nJaps fit themselves to play music even with footgear. Every house with a\r\nlantern at its entrance looked a shrine cherishing a thousand idols\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nI kneeled to the Konpira god.\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly see how to address him, being ignorant what sort of god\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nI felt thirsty when I reached home. Before I pulled a bucket from the\r\nwell, I peeped down into it. The moonbeams were beautifully stealing\r\ninto the waters.\r\n\r\nMy tortoise-shell comb from my head dropped into the well.\r\n\r\nThe waters from far down smiled, heartily congratulating me on going to\r\nAmerikey.\r\n\r\n\r\n25th\xe2\x80\x94I thought all day long how I\xe2\x80\x99ll look in \xe2\x80\x99Merican dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n26th\xe2\x80\x94My shoes and six pairs of silk stockings arrived.\r\n\r\nHow I hoped they were Nippon silk!\r\n\r\nOne pair\xe2\x80\x99s value is 4 yens.\r\n\r\nExtravagance! How dear!\r\n\r\nI hardly see any bit of reason against bare feet.\r\n\r\nWell, of course, it depends on how they are shaped.\r\n\r\nA Japanese girl\xe2\x80\x99s feet are a sweet little piece. Their flatness and\r\narchlessness manifest their pathetic womanliness.\r\n\r\nFeet tell as much as palms.\r\n\r\nI have taken the same laborious care with my feet as with my hands. Now\r\nthey have to retire into the heavy constrained shoes of America.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad, however, to slip one\xe2\x80\x99s feet into gorgeous silk like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMy shoes are of superior shape. They have a small high heel.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m glad they make me much taller.\r\n\r\nA bamboo I set some three Summers ago cast its unusually melancholy\r\nshadow on the round paper window of my room, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cSara! Sara!\r\nSara!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sounded to me like a pallid voice of sayonara.\r\n\r\n(By the way, the profuse tips of my bamboo are like the ostrich plumes\r\nof my new American hat.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSayonara\xe2\x80\x9d never sounded before more sad, more thrilling.\r\n\r\nMy good-bye to \xe2\x80\x9chome sweet home\xe2\x80\x9d amid the camellias and white\r\nchrysanthemums is within ten days. The steamer \xe2\x80\x9cBelgic\xe2\x80\x9d leaves Yokohama\r\non the sixth of next month. My beloved uncle is chaperon during my\r\nAmerican journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n27th\xe2\x80\x94I scissored out the pictures from the \xe2\x80\x99Merican magazines.\r\n\r\n(The magazines were all tired-looking back numbers. New ones are\r\nserviceable in their own home. Forgotten old actors stray into the\r\nvillages for an inglorious tour. So it is with the magazines. Only the\r\nuseless numbers come to Japan, I presume.)\r\n\r\nThe pictures\xe2\x80\x94Meriken is a country of woman; that\xe2\x80\x99s why, I fancy, the\r\npictures are chiefly of woman\xe2\x80\x94showed me how to pick up the long skirt.\r\nThat one act is the whole \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d of looking charming on the street.\r\nI apprehend that the grace of American ladies is in the serpentine\r\ncurves of the figure, in the narrow waist.\r\n\r\nWoman is the slave of beauty.\r\n\r\nI applied my new corset to my body. I pulled it so hard.\r\n\r\nIt pained me.\r\n\r\n\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94My heart was a lark.\r\n\r\nI sang, but not in a trembling voice like a lark, some slices of school\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nI skipped around my garden.\r\n\r\nBecause it occurred to me finally that I\xe2\x80\x99ll appear beautiful in my new\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nI smiled happily to the sunlight whose autumnal yellow flakes\xe2\x80\x94how yellow\r\nthey were!\xe2\x80\x94fell upon my arm stretched to pluck a chrysanthemum.\r\n\r\nI admit that my arm is brown.\r\n\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s shapely.\r\n\r\n\r\n29th\xe2\x80\x94English of America\xe2\x80\x94sir, it is light, unreserved and accessible\xe2\x80\x94grew\r\ndear again. My love of it returned like the glow in a brazier that I had\r\nwatched passionately, then left all the Summer days, and to which I\r\nturned my apologetic face with Winter\xe2\x80\x99s approaching steps.\r\n\r\nOya, oya, my book of Longfellow under the heavy coat of dust!\r\n\r\nI dusted the book with care and veneration as I did a wee image of the\r\nLord a month ago.\r\n\r\nThe same old gentle face of \xe2\x80\x99Merican poet\xe2\x80\x94a poet need not always to\r\nsing, I assure you, of tragic lamentation and of \xe2\x80\x9cfar-beyond\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94stared at\r\nme from its frontispiece. I wondered if he ever dreamed his volume would\r\nbe opened on the tiny brown palms of a Japan girl. A sudden fancy came\r\nto me as if he\xe2\x80\x94the spirit of his picture\xe2\x80\x94flung his critical impressive\r\neyes at my elaborate cue with coral-headed pin, or upon my face.\r\n\r\nAm I not a lovely young lady?\r\n\r\nI had thrown Longfellow, many months ago, on the top shelf where a grave\r\nspider was encamping, and given every liberty to that reticent,\r\nstudious, silver-haired gentleman Mr. Moth to tramp around the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArcadie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moth ran out without giving his own \xe2\x80\x9chonourable\xe2\x80\x9d impression of the\r\npopular poet, when I let the pages flutter.\r\n\r\nLarge fatherly poet he is, but not unique. Uniqueness, however, has\r\nbecome commonplace.\r\n\r\nPoet of \xe2\x80\x9cplain\xe2\x80\x9d plainness is he\xe2\x80\x94plainness in thought and colour. Even\r\nhis elegance is plain enough.\r\n\r\nI must read Mr. Longfellow again as I used a year ago reclining in the\r\nSpring breeze,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA Psalm of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Village Blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x9d and half a\r\ndozen snatches from \xe2\x80\x9cEvangeline\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Song of Hiawatha\xe2\x80\x9d at the least.\r\nThat is not because I am his devotee\xe2\x80\x94I confess the poet of my taste\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t he\xe2\x80\x94but only because he is a great idol of American ladies, as I am\r\noften told, and I may suffer the accusation of idiocy in America, if I\r\nbe not charming enough to quote lines from his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n30th\xe2\x80\x94Many a year I have prayed for something more decent than a marriage\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the generous destiny that will convey me to the illustrious\r\ncountry of \xe2\x80\x9cwoman first\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t the \xe2\x80\x9csomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am pleased to sail for Amerikey, being a woman.\r\n\r\nShall I have to become \xe2\x80\x9cnaturalized\xe2\x80\x9d in America?\r\n\r\nThe Jap \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94who desires the old barbarity\xe2\x80\x94persists still in\r\nfancying that girls are trading wares.\r\n\r\nWhen he shall come to understand what is Love!\r\n\r\nFie on him!\r\n\r\nI never felt more insulted than when I was asked in marriage by one\r\nunknown to me.\r\n\r\nNo Oriental man is qualified for civilisation, I declare.\r\n\r\nEducate man, but\xe2\x80\x94beg your pardon\xe2\x80\x94not the woman!\r\n\r\nModern gyurls born in the enlightened period of Meiji are endowed with\r\nquite a remarkable soul.\r\n\r\nI act as I choose. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t to wait for my mamma\xe2\x80\x99s approval to laugh\r\nwhen I incline to.\r\n\r\n\r\nOct. 1st\xe2\x80\x94I stole into the looking-glass\xe2\x80\x94woman loses almost her delight\r\nin life if without it\xe2\x80\x94for the last glimpse of my hair in Japan style.\r\n\r\nButterfly mode!\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll miss it adorning my small head, while I\xe2\x80\x99m away from home.\r\n\r\nI have often thought that Japanese display Oriental rhetoric\xe2\x80\x94only\r\noppressive rhetoric that palsies the spirit\xe2\x80\x94in hair dressing. Its beauty\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t animation.\r\n\r\nI longed for another new attraction on my head.\r\n\r\nI felt sad, however, when I cut off all the paper cords from my hair.\r\n\r\nI dreaded that the American method of dressing the hair might change my\r\nhead into an absurd little thing.\r\n\r\nMy lengthy hair languished over my shoulders.\r\n\r\nI laid me down on the bamboo porch in the pensive shape of a mermaid\r\nfresh from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sportive breezes frolicked with my hair. They must be mischievous\r\nboys of the air.\r\n\r\nI thought the reason why Meriken coiffure seemed savage and without art\r\nwas mainly because it prized more of natural beauty.\r\n\r\nNaturalness is the highest of all beauties.\r\n\r\nSayo shikaraba!\r\n\r\nLet me learn the beauty of American freedom, starting with my hair!\r\n\r\nAre you sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not slovenliness?\r\n\r\nWoman\xe2\x80\x99s slovenliness is only forgiven where no gentleman is born.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd\xe2\x80\x94Occasional forgetfulness, I venture to say, is one of woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\nBut I fear too many lapses in my case fill the background.\r\n\r\nI amuse myself sometimes fancying whether I shall forget my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname (if I ever have one).\r\n\r\nHow shall I manage \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwill\xe2\x80\x9d? My memory of it is faded.\r\n\r\nI searched for a printed slip, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to use Shall and Will.\xe2\x80\x9d I pressed to\r\nexplore even the pantry after it.\r\n\r\nAfterward I recalled that Professor asserted that Americans were not\r\nprecise in grammar. The affirmation of any professor isn\xe2\x80\x99t weighty\r\nenough. But my restlessness was cured somehow.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be the age of Jap girls!\xe2\x80\x9d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\nI was reading a paper on our bamboo land, penned by Mr. Somebody.\r\n\r\nThe style was inferior to Irving\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nI have read his gratifying \xe2\x80\x9cSketch Book.\xe2\x80\x9d I used to sleep holding it\r\nunder my wooden pillow.\r\n\r\nWoman feels happy to stretch her hand even in dream, and touch something\r\nthat belongs to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cSketch Book\xe2\x80\x9d was my child for many, many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nMr. Somebody has lavished adoring words over my sisters.\r\n\r\nArigato! Thank heavens!\r\n\r\nIf he didn\xe2\x80\x99t declare, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cno sensible musume will prefer a\r\nforeign raiment to her kimono!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe failed to make of me a completely happy nightingale.\r\n\r\nShall I meet the Americans in our flapping gown?\r\n\r\nI imagined myself hitting off a tune of \xe2\x80\x9cKaran Coron\xe2\x80\x9d with clogs, in\r\ncircumspect steps, along Fifth Avenue of somewhere. The throng swarmed\r\naround me. They tugged my silken sleeves, which almost swept the ground,\r\nand inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much a yard?\xe2\x80\x9d Then they implored me to sing some\r\nJapanese ditty.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not play any sensational r\xc3\xb4le for any price.\r\n\r\nLet me remain a homely lass, though I express no craft in Meriken dress.\r\n\r\nDo I look shocking in a corset?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Pekin you have to speak Makey Hey Rah\xe2\x80\x9d is my belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd\xe2\x80\x94My hand has seldom lifted anything weightier than a comb to adjust\r\nmy hair flowing down my neck.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9csilver\xe2\x80\x9d knife (large and sharp enough to fight the Russians)\r\ndropped and cracked a bit of the rim of the big plate.\r\n\r\nMy hand tired.\r\n\r\nMy uncle and I were seated at a round table in a celebrated American\r\nrestaurant, the \xe2\x80\x9cWestern Sea House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was my first occasion to face an orderly heavy Meriken table d\xe2\x80\x99hote.\r\n\r\nIts fertile taste was oily, the oppressive smell emetic.\r\n\r\nMust I make friends with it?\r\n\r\nI am afraid my small stomach is only fitted for a bowl of rice and a few\r\ncuts of raw fish.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more light, more inviting, than Japanese fare. It is\r\nlike a sweet Summer villa with many a sliding shoji from which you smile\r\ninto the breeze and sing to the stars.\r\n\r\nLightness is my choice.\r\n\r\nWhen, I wondered, could I feel at home with American food!\r\n\r\nMy uncle is a Meriken \xe2\x80\x9ctoow.\xe2\x80\x9d He promised to show me a heap of things in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nHe is an 1884 Yale graduate. He occupies the marked seat of the chief\r\nsecretary of the \xe2\x80\x9cNippon Mining Company.\xe2\x80\x9d He has procured leave for one\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat were the questionable-looking fragments on the plate?\r\n\r\nPieces with pock-marks!\r\n\r\nCheese was their honourable name.\r\n\r\nMy uncle scared me by saying that some \xe2\x80\x9ccharming\xe2\x80\x9d worms resided in them.\r\n\r\nPooh, pooh!\r\n\r\nThey emitted an annoying smell. You have to empty the choicest box of\r\ntooth powder after even the slightest intercourse with them.\r\n\r\nI dare not make their acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94no, not for a thousand yens.\r\n\r\nI took a few of them in my pocket papers merely as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nShall I hang them on the door, so that the pest may not come near to our\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\n(Even the pest-devils stay away from it, you see.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4th\xe2\x80\x94The \xe2\x80\x9cBelgic\xe2\x80\x9d makes one day\xe2\x80\x99s delay. She will leave on the seventh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not one week?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nI pray that I may sleep a few nights longer in my home. I grow sadder,\r\nthinking of my departure.\r\n\r\nMy mother shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the Meriken wharf. Her tears may easily stop\r\nmy American adventure.\r\n\r\nI and my maid went to our Buddhist monastery.\r\n\r\nI offered my good-bye to the graves of my grandparents. I decked them\r\nwith elegant bunches of chrysanthemums.\r\n\r\nWhen we turned our steps homeward the snowy-eyebrowed monk\xe2\x80\x94how unearthly\r\nhe appeared!\xe2\x80\x94begged me not to forget my family\xe2\x80\x99s church while I am in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristians are barbarians. They eat beef at funerals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHis voice was like a chant.\r\n\r\nThe winds brought a gush of melancholy evening prayer from the temple.\r\n\r\nThe tolling of the monastery bell was tragic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoun! Goun! Goun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n5th\xe2\x80\x94A \xe2\x80\x9cchin koro\xe2\x80\x9d barked after me.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese little doggie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know better. He has to encounter many\r\na strange thing.\r\n\r\nThe tap of my shoes was a thrill to him. The rustling of my silk\r\nskirt\xe2\x80\x94such a volatile sound\xe2\x80\x94sounded an alarm to him.\r\n\r\nI was hurrying along the road home from uncle\xe2\x80\x99s in Meriken dress.\r\n\r\nWhat a new delight I felt to catch the peeping tips of my shoes from\r\nunder my trailing koshi goromo.\r\n\r\nI forced my skirt to wave, coveting a more satisfactory glance.\r\n\r\nDid I look a suspicious character?\r\n\r\nI was glad, it amused me to think the dog regarded me as a foreign girl.\r\n\r\nOh, how I wished to change me into a different style! Change is so\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nMy imitation was clever. It succeeded.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered my house my maid was dismayed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBikkuri shita! You terrified me. I took you for an ijin from Meriken\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho! O ho, ho, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI passed gracefully (like a princess making her triumphant exit in the\r\nfifth act) into my chamber, leaving behind my happiest laughter and shut\r\nmyself up.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Genjiro Yeto\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cA NEW DELIGHT TO CATCH THE PEEPING TIPS OF MY SHOES\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess that I earned the most delicious moment I have had for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI cannot surrender under the accusation that Japs are _only_ imitators,\r\nbut I admit that we Nippon daughters are suited to be mimics.\r\n\r\nAm I not gifted in the adroit art?\r\n\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Somebody who made himself useful to warn the musumes?\r\n\r\nThen I began to rehearse the scene of my first interview with a white\r\nlady at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nI opened Bartlett\xe2\x80\x99s English Conversation Book, and examined it to see if\r\nwhat I spoke was correct.\r\n\r\nI sat on the writing table. Japanese houses set no chairs.\r\n\r\n(Goodness, mottainai! I sat on the great book of Confucius.)\r\n\r\nThe mirror opposite me showed that I was a \xe2\x80\x9clittle dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n6th\xe2\x80\x94It rained.\r\n\r\nSoft, woolen Autumn rain like a gossamer!\r\n\r\nIts suggestive sound is a far-away song which is half sob, half odor.\r\nThe October rain is sweet sad poetry.\r\n\r\nI slid open a paper door.\r\n\r\nMy house sits on the hill commanding a view over half Tokio and the Bay\r\nof Yedo.\r\n\r\nMy darling city\xe2\x80\x94with an eternal tea and cake, with lanterns of\r\nfestival\xe2\x80\x94looked up to me through the gray veil of rain.\r\n\r\nI felt as if Tokio were bidding me farewell.\r\n\r\nSayonara!

How many a time\r\nwould I have preferred death!\r\n\r\nMy little self wholly exhausted by sea-sickness. Have I to drift to\r\nAmerica in skin and bone?\r\n\r\nI felt like a paper flag thrown in a tempest.\r\n\r\nThe human being is a ridiculously small piece. Nature plays with it and\r\nkills it when she pleases.\r\n\r\nI cannot blame Balboa for his fancy, because he caught his first view\r\nfrom the peak in Darien.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the \xe2\x80\x9cPacific Ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d The breaker of the world!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel any better?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired my fellow passenger.\r\n\r\nHe is the new minister to the City of Mexico on his way to his post. My\r\nuncle is one of his closest friends.\r\n\r\nWhat if Meriken ladies should mistake me for the \xe2\x80\x9csweet\xe2\x80\x9d wife of such a\r\nshabby pock-marked gentleman?\r\n\r\nIt will be all right, I thought, for we shall part at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n(The pock-mark is rare in America, Uncle said. No country has a special\r\ndemand for it, I suppose.)\r\n\r\nHis boyish carelessness and samurai-fashioned courtesy are\r\ncharacteristic. His great laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d echoes on half a mile.\r\n\r\nHe never leaves his wine glass alone. My uncle complains of his empty\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nThe more the minister repeats his cup the more his eloquence rises on\r\nthe Chinese question. He does not forget to keep up his honourable\r\nstandard of diplomatist even in drinking, I fancy.\r\n\r\nI see charm in the eloquence of a drunkard.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI exposed myself on deck for the first time.\r\n\r\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong enough, alas! to face the threatening grandeur of the\r\nocean. Its divineness struck and wounded me.\r\n\r\nO such an expanse of oily-looking waters! O such a menacing largeness!\r\n\r\nOne star, just one sad star, shone above.\r\n\r\nI thought that the little star was trembling alone on a deck of some\r\nship in the sky.\r\n\r\nStar and I cried.\r\n\r\n\r\n13th\xe2\x80\x94My first laughter on the ocean burst out while I was peeping at a\r\nlabel, \xe2\x80\x9c7 yens,\xe2\x80\x9d inside the chimney-pot hat of our respected minister,\r\nwhen he was brushing it.\r\n\r\nHe must have bought that great headgear just on the eve of his\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nHow stupid to leave such a bit of paper!\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\nHe asked what was so irresistibly funny.\r\n\r\nI laughed more. I hardly repressed \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9chelpless me\xe2\x80\x9d clinging on the bed for many a day feels splendid\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe ocean grew placid.\r\n\r\nOn the land my eyes meet with a thousand temptations. They are here\r\nopened for nothing but the waters or the sun-rays.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t gain any lesson, but I have learned to appreciate the\r\ndemonstrations of light.\r\n\r\nThey were white. O what a heavenly whiteness!\r\n\r\nThe billows sang a grand slow song in blessing of the sun, sparkling\r\ntheir ivory teeth.\r\n\r\nThe voyage isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad, is it?\r\n\r\nI planted myself on the open deck, facing Japan.\r\n\r\nI am a mountain-worshipper.\r\n\r\nAlas!

I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put it in order\r\nsince I left the Orient. Such negligence of toilet would be fined by the\r\npolice in Japan.\r\n\r\nI was busy with my hair all the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n15th\xe2\x80\x94The Sunday service was held.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more natural on a voyage than to pray.\r\n\r\nWe have abandoned the land.

He is not the Hotoke Sama of\r\nBuddhism.\r\n\r\nWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t those red-faced sailors hum heavenly-voiced hymns instead\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cswear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n16th\xe2\x80\x94Amerikey is away beyond.\r\n\r\nNot even a speck of San Francisco in sight yet!\r\n\r\nI amused myself thinking what would happen if I never returned home.\r\n\r\nMarriage with a \xe2\x80\x99Merican, wealthy and comely?\r\n\r\nI had well-nigh decided that I would not cross such an ocean again by\r\nship. I would wait patiently until a trans-Pacific railroad is erected.\r\n\r\nI was basking in the sun.\r\n\r\nI fancied the \xe2\x80\x9cBelgic\xe2\x80\x9d navigating a wrong track.\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nWas I approaching lantern-eyed demons or howling cannibals?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIya, iya, no! I will proudly land on the historical island of Lotos\r\nEaters.\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I take Homer with me? The ocean is just the place for his\r\nmajestic simplicity and lofty swing.\r\n\r\nI recalled a few passages of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lotos Eaters\xe2\x80\x9d by Lord Tennyson\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nsounds better than \xe2\x80\x9cthe poet Tennyson.\xe2\x80\x9d I love titles, but they are\r\nthought as common as millionaires nowadays.\r\n\r\nA Jap poet has a different mode of speech.\r\n\r\nShall I pose as poet?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis no great crime to do so.\r\n\r\nI began my \xe2\x80\x9cLotos Eaters\xe2\x80\x9d with the following mighty lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9cO dreamy land of stealing shadows!\r\n               O peace-breathing land of calm afternoon!\r\n               O languid land of smile and lullaby!\r\n               O land of fragrant bliss and flower!\r\n               O eternal land of whispering Lotos Eaters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I feared that some impertinent poet might have said the same thing\r\nmany a year before.\r\n\r\nPoem manufacture is a slow job.\r\n\r\nModern people slight it, calling it an old fashion. Shall I give it up\r\nfor some more brilliant up-to-date pose?\r\n\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94I began to knit a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s stockings in wool.\r\n\r\nThey will be a souvenir of this voyage.\r\n\r\n(I cannot keep a secret.)\r\n\r\nI tell you frankly that I designed them to be given to the gentleman who\r\nwill be my future \xe2\x80\x9cbeloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wool is red, a symbol of my sanguine attachment.\r\n\r\nThe stockings cannot be much larger than my own feet. I dislike\r\nlarge-footed gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n18th\xe2\x80\x94My uncle asked if my great work of poetical inspiration was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t written a dozen lines yet. My \xe2\x80\x98Lotos Eaters\xe2\x80\x99 is to be\r\nequal in length to \xe2\x80\x98The Lady of the Lake.\xe2\x80\x99 Now, see, Oji San, mine has\r\nto be far superior to the laureate\xe2\x80\x99s, not merely in quality, but in\r\nquantity as well. But I thought it was not the way of a sweet Japanese\r\ngirl to plunder a garland from the old poet by writing in rivalry. Such\r\na nice man Tennyson was!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI smiled and gazed on him slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! You are very kind!\xe2\x80\x9d he jerked.\r\n\r\n\r\n19th\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think San Francisco is very far off now. Shall I step out\r\nof the ship and walk?\r\n\r\nHas the \xe2\x80\x9cBelgic\xe2\x80\x9d coal enough? I wonder how the sensible steamer can be\r\nso slow!\r\n\r\nLet the blank pages pass quickly! Let me come face to face with the new\r\nchapter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gray monotone of life makes me insane.\r\n\r\nSuch an eternal absence of variety on the ocean!\r\n\r\n\r\n20th\xe2\x80\x94The moon\xe2\x80\x94how large is the ocean moon!\xe2\x80\x94sat above my head.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought that that moon must have been visiting in my dearest home\r\nof Tokio, the tragic scene of my \xe2\x80\x9cSayonara, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d instantly returned.\r\n\r\nTears on my cheeks!\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning, 21st\xe2\x80\x94Three P.M. of to-day!\r\n\r\nAt last!\r\n\r\nBeautiful Miss Morning Glory shall land on her dream-land, Amerikey.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s my humble name, sir.\r\n\r\n18 years old.\r\n\r\n(Why does the \xe2\x80\x99Merican lady regard it as an insult to be asked her own\r\nage?)\r\n\r\nMy knitting work wasn\xe2\x80\x99t half done.

What a deafening uproar!\r\n\r\nThe lazy halt of a moment on the street must have been regarded, I\r\nfancied, as a violation of the law.\r\n\r\nI wondered whether one dozen were not slain each hour on Market Street\r\nby the cars.\r\n\r\nCars!

Not even one\r\ngentleman moved his admiring eyes to my face.\r\n\r\nHow sad!\r\n\r\nI thought it must be some festival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the usual Saturday throng!\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle said.\r\n\r\nThen I asked myself whether Tokio streets were only like a midnight of\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\nMy beloved minister kept his mouth open\xe2\x80\x94what heavy lips he had!\xe2\x80\x94amazed\r\nat the high edifices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ho, that\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, throwing his sottish eyes on the\r\nclock of the _Chronicle_ building.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys are commenting on you,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered.\r\n\r\nI beseeched him not to act so droll.\r\n\r\nHe tossed out in his careless fashion his everlasting heroic laughter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hawkish lad\xe2\x80\x94I have not seen one sleepy fellow yet\xe2\x80\x94drew near the\r\nminister shortly after we left the wharf, and begged to carry his bag.\r\n\r\nHe was only too glad to be assisted. The brown diplomatist thought it a\r\nloving deed toward a foreigner.\r\n\r\nHe bowed after some blocks, thanking the boy with a hearty \xe2\x80\x9carigato.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you have to pay me two bits!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand went to his pocket, when my uncle tapped his stooping back,\r\nspeaking: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the country of eternal \xe2\x80\x98pay, pay, pay,\xe2\x80\x99 old man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does a genuine American beggar look like?\xe2\x80\x9d was my old question.\r\n\r\nThe Meriken beggar my friend saw at Yokohama park was dressed up in a\r\nswallow-tail coat. Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s essays were in his hand. He was such a\r\ngenteel Mr. Beggar, she said.\r\n\r\nI often heard that everybody is a millionaire in America. I thought it\r\nlikely that I should see a swell Mr. Beggar among the Americans.\r\n\r\nHow many a time had I planned to make a special trip to Yokohama for\r\nacquaintance with the honourable Emerson scholar!\r\n\r\nAlas, it was merely a fancy!\r\n\r\nI have seen Mr. Beggar on the street.\r\n\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in the formal dignity of a dress coat.\r\n\r\nWhere was his Emerson?\r\n\r\nHe was not unlike his Oriental brothers, after all.\r\n\r\nHe stood, because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to kneeling like the Japs.\r\n\r\nThe only difference was that he carried pencils instead of a musical\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nHe is a merchant,\xe2\x80\x94this is a business country,\xe2\x80\x94while the Japanese Mr.\r\nBeggar is an artist, I suppose.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy little gold watch pointed eleven.\r\n\r\nI have been writing for some hours about my first impression of the city\r\nfrom the wharf, and my journey from there to this Palace Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe number of my room is 489.\r\n\r\nI fear I may not return if I once go out. It\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to remember the\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe large mirror reflected me as being so very small in the big room.\r\n\r\nSuch a great room with high ceiling!\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel at home at all.\r\n\r\nNot a petal of flower. No inviting picture on the wall!\r\n\r\nI was tired of hearing the artificial greeting, \xe2\x80\x9cIrasshai mashi,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonourable welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d of the eternally bowing Japanese hotel attendants.\r\n\r\nBut the too simple treatment of \xe2\x80\x99Merican hotel is hardly to my taste.\r\n\r\nNot even one girl to wait on me here!\r\n\r\nNo \xe2\x80\x9chonourable tea and cake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd\xe2\x80\x94I need repose. The last few weeks have stirred me dreadfully. I\r\nwill slumber just comfortably day after day, I decided.\r\n\r\nBut the same feeling as on the ocean returned.\r\n\r\nMy American bed acted like water, waving at even my slightest motion.\r\n\r\nI fancied I was exercising even in sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is too soft.\r\n\r\nNothing can put me at complete ease like my hereditary lying on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nI was restless all the night long.\r\n\r\nI got up, since the bed was no joy.\r\n\r\nOh, the blue sky!\r\n\r\nI thought I should never again see a sapphire sky while I am here. I was\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThis is church day.\r\n\r\nThe bells of the street-cars sounded musical.\r\n\r\nThe sky appeared in best Sunday dress.\r\n\r\nI felt happy thinking that I should see the stars from my hotel window\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI made many useless trips up and down the elevator for fun.\r\n\r\nWhat a tickling dizziness I tasted!\r\n\r\nI close my eyes when it goes.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully new thing, I reckon.\r\n\r\nSomething on the same plan, I imagine, as a \xe2\x80\x9cseriage\xe2\x80\x9d of the Japanese\r\nstage for a footless ghost rising to vanish.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing to notice what a condescending manner the white\r\ngentlemen display toward ladies.\r\n\r\nThey take off their hats in the elevator\xe2\x80\x94some showing such a great bald\r\nhead, like a funny O Binzuru, that is as common as spectacled\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94if any woman is present. They stand humbly as Japs to the\r\naugust \xe2\x80\x9cSon of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d They crawl out like lambs after the woman steps\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt puzzles me to solve how women can be deserving of such honour.\r\n\r\nWhat a goody-goody act!\r\n\r\nBut I wonder how they behave themselves before God!\r\n\r\n\r\n23rd\xe2\x80\x94It is delightful to sit opposite the whitest of linen and\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nportray on it the face of an imaginary Mr. Sweetheart while eating.\r\n\r\nWhiteness is appetising.\r\n\r\nAnd the boldly-marked creases of the linen are so dear. Without them the\r\nlinen is not half so inviting.\r\n\r\nI was taught the beauty of single line in drawing class some years ago.\r\n\r\nBut now for the first time I fully comprehended it from the Meriken\r\ntablecloth.\r\n\r\nI wished I could ever stay gazing at it.\r\n\r\nIf I start my housekeeping in this country\xe2\x80\x94do I ever dream of it?\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshall not hesitate to invest all my money in linen.\r\n\r\nI laughed when I fancied that I sat with my husband\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s he in the\r\nworld?\xe2\x80\x94spreading a skilfully ironed linen cloth on the Spring grasses\r\n(what a gratifying white and green!), and I upset a teapot over the\r\nlinen, while he ran after water;\xe2\x80\x94then I picked all the buttercups and\r\ncovered the dark red stain.\r\n\r\nThe minister makes a ridiculous show of himself in the dining-room.\r\n\r\nHis laughter draws the attention of every lady.\r\n\r\nThis morning he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans have no courtesy for strangers,\r\nexcept meaning money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he finished his speech with his boisterous \xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pale impatient lady, like a trembling winter leaf, sitting at the\r\ntable next to us, shrugged her shoulders and muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hoped I could invent any scheme to make him hasten to his post\xe2\x80\x94Kara or\r\nTenjiku, whatever place it be.\r\n\r\nHe is good-natured like a rubber stamp.\r\n\r\nBut I am sorry to say that he does not fit Amerikey.\r\n\r\nI was relieved when he announced that his departure would occur\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nMy dignity was saved.\r\n\r\nI cut a square piece of paper. I pencilled on it as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       To the Japanese Legation.\r\n                          The City of Mexico.\r\n                    Handle Carefully, Easily Broken.\r\n\r\n\r\nI put it on the large palm of the minister. I warned him that he should\r\nnever forget to pin it on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean little thing you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAnd his great happy \xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d followed as usual.\r\n\r\nBye-bye!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe negroes are horrid. I scanned them on the first chance of my life.\r\n\r\nWhat is the standard of beauty of their tribe, I am eager to be\r\ninformed!\r\n\r\nI searched for \xe2\x80\x9ccoon\xe2\x80\x9d in my dictionary. The explanation was\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe ever-so-kind Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t consider them, I am certain, as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9canimals allied to the bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTell me what it means.\r\n\r\n\r\n24th\xe2\x80\x94Spittoon!\r\n\r\nThe American spittoon is famous, Uncle says.\r\n\r\nFrom every corner in this nine-story hotel\xe2\x80\x94think of its eight hundred\r\nand fifty-one rooms!\xe2\x80\x94you are met by the greeting of the spittoon.\r\n\r\nHow many thousand are there?\r\n\r\nIt must be a tremendous task to keep them clean as they are.\r\n\r\nI wonder why the proprietor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give the city the benefit of some of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco ought to place spittoons along the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nThe ladies wear such a long gaudy skirt.\r\n\r\nAnd it is quite a fashion of modern gents, it appears, to spit on the\r\npavements.\r\n\r\nThis Palace Hotel is a palace.\r\n\r\nYou drop into the toilet room, for instance.\r\n\r\nYou cannot help exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cIya, haya, Japan is three centuries\r\nbehind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything presents to you a silent lecture of scientific modernism.\r\n\r\nWhenever I am bothered too much by my uncle I lock myself up in the\r\ntoilet room. There I feel the whole world is mine.\r\n\r\nI can take off my shoes. I can play acrobat if I prefer.\r\n\r\nNobody can spy me.\r\n\r\nIt is the place where you can pray or cry all you desire without one\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nMy room is great, equipped with every new invention. Numbers of electric\r\nglobes dazzle with kingly light above my head.\r\n\r\nIf I enter my room at dusk, I push a button of electricity.\r\n\r\nWhat a satisfaction I earn seeing every light appear to my honourable\r\nservice!\r\n\r\nI look upon my finger wondering how such an Oriental little thing can\r\nmake itself potent like the mighty thumb of Mr. Edison.\r\n\r\n\r\n25th\xe2\x80\x94What a novel sensation I felt in writing \xe2\x80\x9cSan Francisco, U.S.A.,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat the head of my tablet!\r\n\r\n(What agitation I shall feel when I write my first \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\xe2\x80\x9d before my\r\nname! Woman must grow tired of being addressed \xe2\x80\x9cMiss,\xe2\x80\x9d sooner or later.)\r\n\r\nI have often said that I hardly saw any necessity for corresponding when\r\none lives on such a small island as Japan.\r\n\r\nI could see my friends in a day or two, at whatever place I was.\r\n\r\nI have now the ocean between me and my home.\r\n\r\nLetter writing is worth while.\r\n\r\nI did not know it was such a sweet piece of work.\r\n\r\nI should declare it to be as legitimate and inexpensive a game as ever\r\nwoman could indulge in.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was stepping along the courtyard of this hotel.\r\n\r\nI have seen a gentleman kissing a woman.\r\n\r\nI felt my face catching fire.\r\n\r\nIs it not a shame in a public place?\r\n\r\nI returned to my apartment. The mirror showed my cheeks still blushing.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Japanese consul and his Meriken wife\xe2\x80\x94she is some inches higher than\r\nher darling\xe2\x80\x94paid us a call.\r\n\r\nI said to myself that they did not match well. It was like a hired haori\r\nwith a different coat of arms.\r\n\r\nThe Consul looked proud, as if he carried a crocodile.\r\n\r\nMrs. Consul invited us for luncheon next Sunday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a family party\xe2\x80\x94O ho, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was unceremonious.\r\n\r\nI noticed that one of her hairpins was about to drop. I thought that\r\nMeriken woman was as careless as I.\r\n\r\nHow many hairpins do you suppose I lost yesterday?\r\n\r\nFour! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that awful?\r\n\r\nMy uncle innocently stated to her I was a great belle of Tokio.\r\n\r\nI secretly pinched his arm through his coat-sleeve. My little signal did\r\nnot influence him at all. He kept on his hyperbolical advertisement of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShe promised a beautiful girl to meet me on Sunday.\r\n\r\nI fancied how she looked.\r\n\r\nI thought my performance of the first interview with Meriken woman was\r\nexcellent. But my rehearsal at home was useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n26th\xe2\x80\x94I lost my little charm.\r\n\r\nIt worried me awfully.\r\n\r\nIt was given me by my old-fashioned mother. She got it after a holy\r\njourney of one month to the shrine of Tenno Sama.\r\n\r\nI should be safe, Mother said, from water, fire and highwayman (what\r\nelse, God only knows) as long as I should carry it.\r\n\r\nI sought after it everywhere. I begged my uncle to let me examine his\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCast off an ancient superstition!\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle scorned.\r\n\r\nI sat languidly on the large armchair which almost swallowed my small\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nI imagined many a punishment already inflicted on me.\r\n\r\nThe tick-tack of my watch from my waist encouraged my nervousness.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more irritating than a tick-tack.\r\n\r\nI locked up my watch in the drawer of the dresser.\r\n\r\nI still felt its tick-tack pursuing my ears.\r\n\r\nThen I put it under the pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n27th\xe2\x80\x94How I wished I could exchange a ten-dollar gold-piece for a tassel\r\nof curly hair!\r\n\r\nAmerican woman is nothing without it.\r\n\r\nIts infirm gesticulation is a temptation.\r\n\r\nIn Japan I regarded it as bad luck to own waving hair.\r\n\r\nBut my tastes cannot remain unaltered in Amerikey.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being covered with even red hair.\r\n\r\nRed hair is vivacity, fit for Summer\xe2\x80\x99s shiny air.\r\n\r\nI remember that I trembled at sight of the red hair of an American woman\r\nat Tokio. Japanese regard it as the hair of the red demon in Jigoku.\r\n\r\nI sat before the looking-glass, with a pair of curling-tongs.\r\n\r\nI tried to manage them with surprising patience. I assure you God\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t vouchsafe me much patience.\r\n\r\nSuch disobedient tools!\r\n\r\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t work at all. I threw them on the floor in indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Genjiro Yeto\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSUCH DISOBEDIENT TOOLS!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wrists pained.\r\n\r\nI sat on the floor, stretching out my legs. My shoe-strings were loosed,\r\nbut my hand did not hasten to them.\r\n\r\nI was exhausted with making my hair curl.\r\n\r\nI sent my uncle to fetch a hair-dresser.\r\n\r\n\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94How old is she?\r\n\r\nI could never suggest the age of a Meriken woman.\r\n\r\nThat Miss Ada was a beauty.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s becoming clearer to me now why California puts so much pride in her\r\nown girls.\r\n\r\nAda was a San Franciscan whom Mrs. Consul presented to me.\r\n\r\nWhat was her family name?\r\n\r\nNever mind! It is an extra to remember it for girls. We don\xe2\x80\x99t use it.\r\n\r\nHow envious I was of her long eyelashes lacing around the large eyes of\r\nbrown hue!\r\n\r\nBrown was my preference for the velvet hanao of my wooden clogs.\r\n\r\nLong eyelashes are a grace, like the long skirt.\r\n\r\nI know that she is a clever young thing.\r\n\r\nShe was learned in the art of raising and dropping her curtain of\r\neyelashes. That is the art of being enchanting. I had said that nothing\r\ncould beat the beauty of my black eyes. But I see there are other pretty\r\neyes in this world.\r\n\r\nEverything doesn\xe2\x80\x99t grow in Japan. Noses particularly.\r\n\r\nMy sweet Ada\xe2\x80\x99s nose was an inspiration, like the snow-capped peak of O\r\nFuji San. It rose calmly\xe2\x80\x94how symmetrically!\xe2\x80\x94from between her eyebrows.\r\n\r\nI had thought that \xe2\x80\x99Merican nose was rugged, big of bone.\r\n\r\nI see an exception in Ada.\r\n\r\nShe must be the pattern of Meriken beauty.\r\n\r\nI felt that I was so very homely.\r\n\r\nI stole a sly glance into the looking-glass, and convinced myself that I\r\nwas a beauty also, but Oriental.\r\n\r\nWe had different attractions.\r\n\r\nShe may be Spring white sunshine, while I am yellow Autumn moonbeams.\r\nOne is animation, and the other sweetness.\r\n\r\nI smiled.\r\n\r\nShe smiled back promptly.\r\n\r\nWe promised love in our little smile.\r\n\r\nShe placed her hand on my shoulder. How her diamond ring flashed! She\r\npraised the satin skin of my face.\r\n\r\nShe was very white, with a few sprinkles of freckles. Their scattering\r\nadded briskness to the face in her case. (But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t San Francisco\r\nproduce too many freckles in woman?) The texture of Ada\xe2\x80\x99s skin wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfine. Her face was like a ripe peach with powdery hair.\r\n\r\nIs it true that dark skin is gaining popularity in American society?\r\n\r\nThe Japanese type of beauty is coming to the front then, I am happy.\r\n\r\nI repaid her compliment, praising her elegant set of teeth.\r\n\r\nAda is the free-born girl of modern Amerikey.\r\n\r\nShe need never fear to open her mouth wide.\r\n\r\nShe must have been using special tooth-powder three times a day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are great friends already, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nAnd I extended my finger-tips behind her, and pulled some wisps of her\r\nchestnut hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and raised her sweetly accusing eyes. Then\r\nour friendship was confirmed.\r\n\r\nGirls don\xe2\x80\x99t take much time to exchange their faith.\r\n\r\nI was uneasy at first, thinking that Ada might settle herself in a\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with me, in the chit-chat of poetry. I tried to recollect\r\nhow the first line of the \xe2\x80\x9cPsalm of Life\xe2\x80\x9d went, for Longfellow would of\r\ncourse be the first one to encounter.\r\n\r\nAlas, I had forgotten it all.\r\n\r\nI was glad that her query did not roam from the remote corner of poesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you play golf?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nShe thinks the same things are going on in Japan.\r\n\r\nAda! Poor Ada!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe honourable consul and my uncle looked stupid at the lunch table.\r\n\r\nI thought they were afraid of being given some difficult question by the\r\nMeriken ladies.\r\n\r\nMrs. Consul and Ada ate like hungry pigs. (I beg their pardon!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou eat like a pussy!\xe2\x80\x9d is no adequate compliment to pay to a Meriken\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nI found out that their English was neither Macaulay\xe2\x80\x99s nor Irving\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n29th\xe2\x80\x94I ate a tongue and some ox-tail soup.\r\n\r\nThink of a suspicious spumy tongue and that dirty bamboo tail!\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it shocking to even incline to taste them?\r\n\r\nMy mother would not permit me to step into the holy ground of any shrine\r\nin Japan. She would declare me perfectly defiled by such food.\r\n\r\nI shall turn into a beast in the jungle by and by, I should say.\r\n\r\nMy uncle committed a greater indecency. He ate a tripe.\r\n\r\nIt was cooked in the \xe2\x80\x9cwestern sea egg-plant,\xe2\x80\x9d to taste of which brings\r\non the small-pox, as I have been told.\r\n\r\nHe said that he took a delight in pig\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nShame on the Nippon gentleman!\r\n\r\nHarai tamae! Kiyome tamae!\r\n\r\n\r\n30th\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cChui, chui, chui!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little sparrow was twittering at my hotel window.\r\n\r\nI could not believe that the sparrow of large America could be as small\r\nas the Nippon-born.\r\n\r\nHorses are large here. Woman\xe2\x80\x99s mouth is large, something like that of an\r\nalligator. Policeman is too large.\r\n\r\nI fancied that little birdie might be one strayed from the bamboo bush\r\nof my family\xe2\x80\x99s monastery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweet vagabond, did you cross the ocean for Meriken Kenbutsu?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChui, chui! Chui, chui, chui!\xe2\x80\x9d he chirped.\r\n\r\nIs \xe2\x80\x9cchui, chui\xe2\x80\x9d English, I wonder?\r\n\r\nI pushed the window up to receive him.\r\n\r\nOya, ma, he has gone!\r\n\r\nI felt so sorry.\r\n\r\nI was yearning after my beloved home.\r\n\r\nThis is the great Chrysanthemum season at home. I missed the show at\r\nDangozaka.\r\n\r\nHow gracefully the time used to pass in Dai Nippon, while I sat looking\r\nat the flowers on a tokonoma.\r\n\r\nEvery place is a strange gray waste to me without the intimate faces of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nFlowers have no price in Japan, just as a poet is nothing, for everybody\r\nthere is poet. But they have a big value in this city\xe2\x80\x94although I am not\r\npositive that an American poet creates wealth.\r\n\r\nI purchased a select bouquet of violets.\r\n\r\nI passed by several young gentlemen. Were their eyes set on my flowers\r\nor my hands?\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t wear gloves. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish my hands to be touched harshly by\r\nthem. Truly I am vain of showing my small hands.\r\n\r\nI love the violet, because it was the favorite of dear John\xe2\x80\x94Keats, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIt may not be a flower. It is decidedly a perfume, anyhow.\r\n\r\n\r\n31st\xe2\x80\x94I have heard a sad piece of news from Mrs. Consul about Mr.\r\nLongfellow.\r\n\r\nShe says that he has ceased to be an idol of American ladies.\r\n\r\nHe has retired to a comfortable fireside to take care of school\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nPoor old poet!\r\n\r\n\r\nNov. 1st\xe2\x80\x94American chair is too high.\r\n\r\nAre my legs too short?\r\n\r\nIt was uncomfortable to sit erect on a chair all the time as if one were\r\nbeing presented before the judge.\r\n\r\nAnd those corsets and shoes!\r\n\r\nThey seized me mercilessly.\r\n\r\nI said that I would spend a few hours in Japan style, reclining on the\r\nfloor like an eloped angel.\r\n\r\nI brought out a crape kimono and my girdle with the ph\xc5\x93nix embroidery,\r\nafter having locked the entrance of my room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKotsu, kotsu, kotsu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomebody was fisting on my door.\r\n\r\nOya, she was Ada, my \xe2\x80\x9cRose of Frisco\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cButterfly of Van Ness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(She was quartered in Van Ness Avenue, the most elegant street of a\r\nwhole bunch.)\r\n\r\nShe was sprightly as a runaway princess. She blew her sunlight and\r\nfragrance into my face.\r\n\r\nI was grateful that I chanced to be acquainted with such a delightful\r\nMeriken lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO ho, Japanese _kimono_! If I might only try it on!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI told her she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d she ejaculated.\r\n\r\nWe promised to spend a gala day together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Genjiro Yeto\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cO HO, JAPANESE KIMONO!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will rehearse,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9ca one-act Japanese play entitled \xe2\x80\x98Two\r\nCherry Blossom Musumes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assisted her to dress up. She was utterly ignorant of Oriental attire.\r\n\r\nWhat a superb development she had in body! Her chest was abundant, her\r\nshoulders gracefully commanding. Her rather large rump, however, did not\r\nshow to advantage in waving dress. Japs prefer a small one.\r\n\r\nMy physical state is in poverty.\r\n\r\nI was wrong to believe that the beauty of woman is in her face.\r\n\r\nIt is so, of course, in Japan. The brown woman eternally sits. The face\r\nis her complete exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Meriken woman is in her shape.\r\n\r\nI pray that my body may grow.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese theatre never begins without three rappings of\r\ntime-honoured wooden blocks.\r\n\r\nI knocked on the pitcher.\r\n\r\nMiss Ada appeared from the dressing room, fluttering an open fan.\r\n\r\nHow ridiculously she stepped!\r\n\r\nIt was the way Miss What\xe2\x80\x99s-her-name acted in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Geisha,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe was much taller than little me. The kimono scarcely reached to her\r\nshoes. I have never seen such an absurd show in my life.\r\n\r\nI was tittering.\r\n\r\nThe charming Ada fanned and giggled incessantly in supposed-to-be\r\nJapanese _chic_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to say, Morning Glory?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d I jerked.\r\n\r\nThen we both laughed.\r\n\r\nAda caught my neck by her arm. She squandered her kisses on me.\r\n\r\n(It was my first taste of the kiss.)\r\n\r\nWe two young ladies in wanton garments rolled down happily on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd\xe2\x80\x94If I could be a gentleman for just one day!\r\n\r\nI would rest myself on the hospitable chair of a barber shop\xe2\x80\x94barber\r\nshop, drug store and candy store are three beauties on the street\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\nprince of leisure, and dream something great, while the man is busy with\r\na razor.\r\n\r\nI am envious of the gentleman who may bathe in such a purple hour.\r\n\r\nI never rest.\r\n\r\nAmerican ladies neither!\r\n\r\nEach one of them looks worried as if she expected the door-bell any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is the penalty of being a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd\xe2\x80\x94My little heart was flooded with patriotism.\r\n\r\nIt is our Mikado\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\r\n\r\nI sang \xe2\x80\x9cThe Age of Our Sovereign.\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted \xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand years!\r\nBanzai! Ban banzai!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle and I hurried to the Japanese Consulate to celebrate this grand\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n4th\xe2\x80\x94The gentlemen of San Francisco are gallant.\r\n\r\nThey never permit the ladies\xe2\x80\x94even a black servant is in the honourable\r\nlist of \xe2\x80\x9cladies\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to stand in the car.\r\n\r\nIf Oriental gentlemen could demean themselves like that for just one\r\nday!\r\n\r\nI should not mind a bit if one proposed to me even.\r\n\r\nI love a handsome face.\r\n\r\nThey part their hair in the middle. They have inherited no bad habit of\r\nbiting their finger-nails. I suppose they offer a grace before each\r\nmeal. Their smile isn\xe2\x80\x99t sardonic, and their laughter is open.\r\n\r\nI have no dispute with their mustaches and their blue eyes. But I am far\r\nfrom being an admirer of their red faces.\r\n\r\nJaps are pygmies. I fear that the Americans are too tall. My future\r\nhusband is not allowed to be over five feet five inches. His nose should\r\nbe of the cast of Robert Stevenson\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nEach one of them carries a high look. He may be the President at the\r\nnext election, he seems to say. How mean that only one head is in\r\ndemand!\r\n\r\nA directory and a dictionary are kind. The \xe2\x80\x99Merican husband is like\r\nthem, I imagine.\r\n\r\nI have no gentleman friend yet.\r\n\r\nTo pace alone on the street is a melancholy discarded sight.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do if your shoe-string comes untied?\r\n\r\nI have seen a gentleman fingering the shoestrings of a lady. How glad he\r\nwas to serve again, when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s too tight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShall my uncle fill such a part?\r\n\r\nPoor uncle!\r\n\r\nOld company, however, isn\xe2\x80\x99t style.\r\n\r\nHe is forty-five.\r\n\r\nWhy can I not choose one to hire from among the \xe2\x80\x9cbully\xe2\x80\x9d young men\r\nloitering around a cigar-stand?\r\n\r\n\r\n5th\xe2\x80\x94My uncle was going out in a black frock-coat and tea-coloured\r\ntrousers. I insisted that his coat and trousers didn\xe2\x80\x99t match.\r\n\r\nHow can a man be so ridiculous?\r\n\r\nI declared that it was as poor taste as for a darkey to wear a red\r\nribbon in her smoky hair.\r\n\r\nUncle surrendered.\r\n\r\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cHei, hei, hei!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoo\xe2\x80\x99 boy!\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the great tea-colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n6th\xe2\x80\x94We had a shower.\r\n\r\nThe city dipped in a bath.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrians threw their vaguely delicate shadows on the pavements.\r\nThe ladies voluntarily permitted the gentlemen to review their legs. If\r\nI were in command, I would not permit the ladies to raise an umbrella\r\nunder the \xe2\x80\x9cpara para\xe2\x80\x9d of a shower. Their hastening figures are so\r\nfascinating.\r\n\r\nThe shower stopped. The pavements were glossed like a looking-glass. The\r\nwindows facing the sun scattered their sparkling laughter.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful!\r\n\r\nI am perfectly delighted by this city.\r\n\r\nOne thing that disappoints me, however, is that Frisco is eternally\r\nsnowless,\r\n\r\nWithout snow the year is incomplete, like a departure without sayonara.\r\n\r\nDear snow! O Yuki San!\r\n\r\nMany Winters ago I modelled a doll of snow, which was supposed to be a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nHow proud I used to be when I stamped the first mark with my high ashida\r\non the white ground before anyone else!\r\n\r\nI wonder how Santa Claus will array himself to call on this town.\r\n\r\nHis fur coat is not appropriate at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n7th\xe2\x80\x94Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I come to Amerikey earlier\xe2\x80\x94in the Summer season?\r\n\r\nI was staring sadly at my purple parasol against the wall by my dresser.\r\n\r\nI have no chance to show it.\r\n\r\nI have often been told that I look so beautiful under it.\r\n\r\n\r\n8th\xe2\x80\x94My darling O Ada came in a carriage. Her two-horsed carriage was\r\nlike that of our Japanese premier.\r\n\r\nShe is the daughter of a banker.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone in yellow.\r\n\r\nAda\xe2\x80\x99s complexion added a brilliancy. I was shocked, fearing that I\r\nlooked awfully brown.\r\n\r\nAda said that I was \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d Can I trust a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eulogy?\r\n\r\nI myself often use flattery.\r\n\r\nA jewel and face-powder were not the only things, I said, essential to\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWe drove to the Golden Gate Park and then to the Cliff House.\r\n\r\nWhat a triumphant sound the hoofs of the bay horses struck! I fancied\r\nthe horses were a poet, they were rhyming.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the automobile.\r\n\r\nAda was sweet as could be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me your honourable love story!\xe2\x80\x9d she chattered.\r\n\r\nI did only blush.\r\n\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the courage to burst my secrecy.\r\n\r\nI loved once truly.\r\n\r\nIt was an innocent love as from a fairy book.\r\n\r\nIf true love could be realised!\r\n\r\nIn the park I noticed a lady who scissored the \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t touch\xe2\x80\x9d flowers and\r\nstepped away with a saintly air. The comical fancy came to me that she\r\nwas the mother of a policeman guarding against intruders.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves in the Japanese tea garden.\r\n\r\nA tiny musume in wooden clogs brought us an honourable tea and o\xe2\x80\x99senbe.\r\n\r\nThe grounds were an imitation of Japanese landscape gardening.\r\n\r\nHomesickness ran through my fibre.\r\n\r\nThe decorative bridge, a stork by the brook, and the dwarf plants hinted\r\nto me of my home garden.\r\n\r\nA sudden vibration of shamisen was flung from the Japanese cottage close\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTenu, tenu! Tenu, tsunn shann!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho was the player?\r\n\r\nWhen I sat myself by the ocean on the beach I found some packages of\r\npeanuts right before me.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Ada began to snap them.\r\n\r\nShe hummed a jaunty ditty. Her head inclined pathetically against my\r\nshoulder. My hair, stirred by the sea zephyrs, patted her cheek.\r\n\r\nShe said the song was \xe2\x80\x9cMy Gal\xe2\x80\x99s a High-Born Lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho was its author? Emerson did not write it surely.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the hotel, I undertook to place on the wall the\r\nweather-torn fragment of cotton which I had picked up at the park.\r\n\r\nThese words were printed on it:\r\n\r\n                              \xe2\x80\x9cKEEP OFF\r\n                               THE GRASS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI decided to mail it to my Japan, requesting my daddy to post it upon my\r\ngarden grasses\xe2\x80\x94somewhere by the old cherry tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n9th\xe2\x80\x94To-day is the third anniversary of my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nI will keep myself in devotion.\r\n\r\nI burned the incense I had bought from a Chinaman. I watched the\r\nbeautiful gesticulation of its smoke.\r\n\r\nGood Grandma!\r\n\r\nShe wished she could live long enough to be present at my wedding\r\nceremony. She prayed that she might select the marriage equipage for me.\r\n\r\nI am alone yet.\r\n\r\nI wonder if she knows\xe2\x80\x94does her ghost peep from the grasses?\xe2\x80\x94that I am\r\ndrifting among the ijins she ever loathed.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how to manage myself sometimes\xe2\x80\x94like an unskilful fictionist\r\nwith his heroine.\r\n\r\nWhen shall I get married?\r\n\r\n\r\n10th\xe2\x80\x94I yawned.\r\n\r\nNothing is more unbecoming to a woman than yawning.\r\n\r\nI think it no offence to swear once in a while in one\xe2\x80\x99s closet.\r\n\r\nI was alone.\r\n\r\nI tore to pieces my \xe2\x80\x9cThings Seen in the Street,\xe2\x80\x9d and fed the waste-paper\r\nbasket with them.\r\n\r\nThe basket looked so hungry without any rubbish. An unkept basket is\r\nmore pleasing, like a soiled autograph-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to Amerikey to be critical, that is, to act mean, did I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said.\r\n\r\nI must remain an Oriental girl, like a cherry blossom smiling softly in\r\nthe Spring moonlight.\r\n\r\nBut afterwards I felt sorry for my destruction.\r\n\r\nI thrust my hand into the basket. I plucked them up. They were illegibly\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9c       women coursing like a\r\n              \xe2\x80\x99rikisha of \xe2\x80\x99Hama       their children\r\n              crying at home       left somewhere\r\n              their womanliness\r\n              gentleman with stove-pipe hat       blowing\r\n              nose with his fingers       young\r\n              lady       kept busy chewing gum\r\n              while walking. If you once show such a grace\r\n              at Tokio, you shall wait fruitlessly for the\r\n              marriage offer.\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9c       old grandma in gay red skirt\r\n                     aged man arm-in-arm with wife\r\n              so young       What a martyrdom\r\n              to marry for G-O-L-D!       policeman\r\n              has no\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9cSan Francisco is a beautiful city, but\r\n              \xe2\x80\x99vertisements of \xe2\x80\x98The Girl From Paris\xe2\x80\x99\r\n                     W\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99s Beer\r\n              with the watches hanging on their breasts\r\n                     God bless you, red necktie\r\n              gentleman       woman at the corner\r\n              chattering like a street politician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I missed some other hundred lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n11th\xe2\x80\x94A letter from the minister arrived.\r\n\r\n(I\xe2\x80\x99d be a postman, by the way, if I were a man. A noble work that is to\r\ndeliver around the love and \xe2\x80\x9cgokigen ukagai.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nI clipped off the Mexican stamp.\r\n\r\nI will make a stamp book for my boy who may be born when I become a\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nBefore opening the letter I pressed it to my ear. My imaginative ear\r\nheard his illustrious \xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d rolling out.\r\n\r\nHow I missed his happy laughter!\r\n\r\nCan he now pronounce a \xe2\x80\x9cHow do?\xe2\x80\x9d in Mexican?\r\n\r\n\r\n12th\xe2\x80\x94It surprises me to learn that many an American is born and dies in\r\na hotel.\r\n\r\nSuch a life\xe2\x80\x94however large rooms you may possess\xe2\x80\x94is not distinguishable,\r\nin my opinion, from that of a bird in a cage.\r\n\r\nIs hotel-living a recent fashion?\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\r\n\r\nThe business locality\xe2\x80\x94like the place where this Palace Hotel takes its\r\nseat\xe2\x80\x94does not afford a stomachful of respectable air.\r\n\r\nI preferred some hospitable boarding house in a quiet street, where I\r\nmight even step up and down in nude feet. I wished to occupy a chamber\r\nwhere the morning sun could steal in and shake my sleepy little head\r\nwith golden fingers as my beloved mama might do.\r\n\r\nWe will move to the \xe2\x80\x9chigh-toned\xe2\x80\x9d boarding house of Mrs. Willis this\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nHer house is placed on the high hill of California Street.\r\n\r\nI am grateful there is no car quaking along there.\r\n\r\nMy uncle says I shall have a whole lot of millionaires for neighbours.\r\n\r\nCalifornia must be one dignified street.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese colony is close at hand from Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x94the exotic\r\nexposition brilliant with green and yellow colour. The incense surges.\r\nSo cute is the sparrow-eyed Asiatic girl\xe2\x80\x94such a \xe2\x80\x9ckarako\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with a small\r\ncue on only one side of the head. Dear Oriental town!\r\n\r\nGood luck, I pray, my Palace Hotel!\r\n\r\nSayonara, my graceful butlers!\r\n\r\nI shall hear no more of their sweet \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Madam!\xe2\x80\x9d They talk gently as a\r\nlottery-seller.\r\n\r\nThe more they bow and smile the more you will press the button of tips.\r\n\r\nThey are so funny.\r\n\r\nSo long, everybody!\r\n\r\n\r\n13th\xe2\x80\x94The savour of the air is rich without being heavy.\r\n\r\nThe Tokio atmosphere emits a lassitude.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s natural that the Japs are prone to languor.\r\n\r\nA good while ago I pushed down my window facing the Bay of San\r\nFrancisco. I leaned on the sill, my face propped up by both my hands.\r\n\r\nThe grand scenery absorbed my whole soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdeal place, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I emphasised.\r\n\r\nThe bay was dyed in profound blue.\r\n\r\nThe Oakland boat joggled on happily as from a fairy isle. My visionary\r\neyes caught the heavenly flock of seagulls around it.\r\n\r\nIf I could fly in their company!\r\n\r\nThe low mountains over the bay looked inexpressively comfortable, like\r\none sleeping under a warm blanket.\r\n\r\nThe moon-night view from here must be wonderful.\r\n\r\nI felt a new stream of blood beginning to swell within my body.\r\n\r\nI buzzed a silly song.\r\n\r\nI crept into my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nI stole one stalk of his cigarettes.\r\n\r\nI bit it, aping Mr. Uncle, when my door banged.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th\xe2\x80\x94I bustled back to my room.\r\n\r\nMy breast throbbed.\r\n\r\nA naked woman in an oil painting stood before me in the hall.\r\n\r\nIs Mrs. Willis a lady worthy of respect?\r\n\r\nIt is nothing but an insulting stroke to an Oriental lady\xe2\x80\x94yes sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94to expose such an obscenity.\r\n\r\nI brought down one of my crape haoris, raven-black in hue, with blushing\r\nmaple leaves dispersed on the sleeves, and cloaked the honourable\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nMy haori wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long enough.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the nude woman were all seen.\r\n\r\nI have not the least objection to the undraped feet. They were faultless\r\nin shape.\r\n\r\nI myself am free to bestow a glimpse of my beautiful feet.\r\n\r\nI turned the key of my door.\r\n\r\nI stripped off my shoes and my stockings also.\r\n\r\nDear red silken stockings!\r\n\r\nI scrutinised my feet for a while. Then I asked myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is lovelier, my feet or those in the painting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n15th\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest last night.\r\n\r\nThe long wail of a horn somewhere in the distance\xe2\x80\x94at the gate of the\r\nocean perhaps\xe2\x80\x94haunted me. The night was foggy.\r\n\r\nI had a wild dream.\r\n\r\nThe fogs were not withdrawn this morning.\r\n\r\nI was discouraged, I had to go out in my best gown.\r\n\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a shame that two buttons jumped out when I hurried to dress\r\nup?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the buttons secure?\xe2\x80\x9d is my first worry and the last.\r\n\r\nWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t Meriken inventors take up the subject of buttonless clothes?\r\n\r\nWoman cannot be easy while her dress is fastened by only buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n16th\xe2\x80\x94I wish I could pay my bill with a bank check.\r\n\r\nHave I money in the bank with my name?\r\n\r\nI fancied it a great idea to sleep with a big bank book under the\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nI decided to save my money hereafter.\r\n\r\nHow often have I expressed my hatred of an economical woman!\r\n\r\nI detested the clinking \xe2\x80\x9ccharin charan\xe2\x80\x9d of small coins in my purse. Very\r\nhard I tried to get from them.\r\n\r\nExtravagance is a folly. Folly is only a mild expression for crime.\r\n\r\nI deducted ten dollars from the fifty that I had settled for my new\r\nstreet gown. I dropped a card notifying my ladies\xe2\x80\x99 tailor that I had\r\naltered my mind for the second price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen already for the bank!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI took it to the \xe2\x80\x9cYokohama Shokin Ginko\xe2\x80\x9d of this city.\r\n\r\nI was given a little book for the first time in my life.\r\n\r\nI thought myself quite a wealthy woman preserving my money in the bank.\r\n\r\nI pressed the book to my face. I held it close to my bosom as a tiny\r\ngirl with a new doll.\r\n\r\nAnd I smiled into a looking-glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94I went to the gallery of the photographer Taber, and posed in\r\nNippon \xe2\x80\x9cpera pera.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe photographer spread before me many pictures of the actress in the\r\npart of \xe2\x80\x9cGeisha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was absurd.\r\n\r\nI cannot comprehend where \xe2\x80\x99Mericans get the conception that Jap girls\r\nare eternally smiling puppets.\r\n\r\nAre we crazy to smile without motive?\r\n\r\nWhat an untidy presence!\r\n\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t even fasten the front of her kimono.\r\n\r\nCharm doesn\xe2\x80\x99t walk together with disorder under the same Japanese\r\nparasol.\r\n\r\nAnd I had the honour to be presented to an extraordinary mode in her\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nIt might be entitled \xe2\x80\x9cghost style.\xe2\x80\x9d It suggested an apparition in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBotan Toro\xe2\x80\x9d played by kikugoro.\r\n\r\nThe photographer handed me a fan.\r\n\r\nAlas! It was a Chinese fan in a crude mixture of colour.\r\n\r\nHe urged me to carry it.\r\n\r\nI declined, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody fans in cool November!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n18th\xe2\x80\x94We had a laugh.\r\n\r\nAda, my sweet singer of \xe2\x80\x9cMy Gal\xe2\x80\x99s a High-Born Lady,\xe2\x80\x9d accompanied me to a\r\nmatin\xc3\xa9e of one vaudeville.\r\n\r\nThis is the age of quick turn, sudden flashes.\r\n\r\nThe long show has ceased to be the fashion. Modern people are tired of\r\nthe slowness of old times which was once supposed to be seriousness.\r\n\r\nCould anything be prouder than the face of the acrobat retiring after a\r\nperilous performance?\r\n\r\nWoman tumbler!\r\n\r\nI wondered how Meriken ladies could enjoy looking at such a degeneration\r\nof woman.\r\n\r\nI was glad, however, that I did not see any snake-charmer.\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful voice that negro had! Who could imagine that such a\r\nsilvery sound could come from such a midnight face? It was like clear\r\nwater out of the ground.\r\n\r\nI was struck by a fancy.\r\n\r\nI sprang up.\r\n\r\nI attempted to imitate the high-kick dance.\r\n\r\nI fell down abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJap\xe2\x80\x99s short leg is no use in Amerikey\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve one thing. I am\r\nfrankly tired of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d I grumbled.\r\n\r\n\r\n19th\xe2\x80\x94The Sunday chime was the voice of an angel. The city turned\r\nreligious.\r\n\r\nMrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x94I had no curiosity about her first name; it is meaningless\r\nfor the \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\xe2\x80\x9d of middle age\xe2\x80\x94indulged in chat with me.\r\n\r\nIf I say she was \xe2\x80\x9csociable\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x94it sounds so graceful.\r\n\r\nShe announced herself a bigot of poetry. She was bending to make a full\r\npoetical demonstration.\r\n\r\nOf course it was more pleasing than a mourning-gowned narrative of her\r\nlamented husband. (I suppose he is dead, as divorce is too commonplace.)\r\n\r\nBut it were treachery, if I were put under her long recital of the\r\ninsignificant works of local poets.\r\n\r\nTasukatta wa!\r\n\r\nA little girl came as a relief.\r\n\r\nDorothy! She is a boarder of Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99, the golden-haired daughter of\r\nMrs. Browning.\r\n\r\n(Mrs. Browning was a disappointment, however. I fancied she might be a\r\nrelative of the poet Browning. I asked about it. Her response was an\r\nunsympathetic \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99 hayo!\xe2\x80\x9d Dorothy said, spattering over me her familiarity.\r\n\r\nIt takes only an hour to be friends with the Meriken girl, while it is\r\nthe work of a year with a Japanese musume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat girl! Your Nippon language is perfect! Would you like to learn\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like it,\xe2\x80\x9d was her retort.\r\n\r\nThen we slipped to my room.\r\n\r\nI wonder how Mrs. Willis fared without an audience!\r\n\r\nI was sorry, thinking that she might regard me as an uncivil Jap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChon kina! Chon kina!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus Dorothy repeated. It was a Japanese song, she said, which the\r\ngeisha girls sung in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Geisha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTat, tat, tat, stop, Dorothy!\r\n\r\nTruly it was the opening sound\xe2\x80\x94not the words\xe2\x80\x94of a nonsensical song.\r\n\r\nI presume that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Geisha\xe2\x80\x9d is practising a plenteous injustice to Dai\r\nNippon.\r\n\r\nI recalled one Meriken consul who jolted out that same song once at a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nHe became no more a gentleman to me after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n20th\xe2\x80\x94I pasted my little card on my door.\r\n\r\nI wrote on it \xe2\x80\x9cJapanese Lessons Given.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gazed at it.\r\n\r\nI was exceedingly happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n21st\xe2\x80\x94A gardener came to fix our lawn.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing lovelier than verdant grasses trimmed neatly. They are\r\nlike the short skirt of the Meriken little girl.\r\n\r\nWe women could be angels, I thought, if our speech lapped justly. Women\r\ntalk superfluously. I do often.\r\n\r\nWhat language did that gardener use?\r\n\r\nIt must be the English of Carlyle, I said, for its meaning was\r\nintangible.\r\n\r\nI discovered, by and by, that German English was his honourable choice.\r\n\r\nMy eyes could express more than my English uttered in Nippon voice. My\r\ngestures helped to make my meaning plain.\r\n\r\nHe became my friend.\r\n\r\nHe carried a red square of cotton to wipe his mouth, like the furoshiki\r\nin which a Japanese country \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99 ba san\xe2\x80\x9d wraps her New Year\xe2\x80\x99s present.\r\n\r\nAnd again as he was leaving I saw a red thing around his neck.\r\n\r\nWas it not the same furoshiki which served for his nose?\r\n\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad idea to play amateur gardener.\r\n\r\nThe season wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fitting for such a performance, however.\r\n\r\nA large summer hat! That was the customary attire.\r\n\r\nBut my light-hearted straw one with its laughing bouquet was not adapted\r\nto November, however gorgeously the sun might shine.\r\n\r\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s sheer stupidity to track after a tradition.\r\n\r\nI wound a large flapping piece of black crape about my head. (How\r\nawfully becoming the garb of a Catholic nun would be! I do not know what\r\nis dear, if it is not the rosary. A writhing rope around the waist is\r\ncelestial carelessness.)\r\n\r\nI appeared on the lawn, but without a sprinkler and rake. It would have\r\nbeen too theatrical to carry them.\r\n\r\nI gathered the small stones from amid the grasses into a wheelbarrow\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\nJust as my new enterprise was beginning to seem so delightful, the\r\nluncheon gong gonged.\r\n\r\nMy uncle goggled from the hall, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been? I was afraid you had eloped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no chance yet to meet a boy,\xe2\x80\x9d I spoke in an undertone.\r\n\r\nAfterward I was ashamed that I had been so awkwardly sincere.\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd\xe2\x80\x94There was one thing that I wanted to test.\r\n\r\nMy uncle went out. I understood that he would not be back for some\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nI found myself in his room, pulling out his drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it elegant?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, picking up his dress-suit.\r\n\r\nAt last I had an opportunity to examine how I would look in a tapering\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nGentleman\xe2\x80\x99s suit is fascinating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is his silk hat?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI reached up my arms to the top shelf of a closet, standing on the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open.\r\n\r\nTamageta! My liver was crushed by the alarm.\r\n\r\nA chambermaid threw her suspicious smile at me.\r\n\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\nMy adventure failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n23rd\xe2\x80\x94I mean no one else but O Ada San, when I say \xe2\x80\x9cmy sweet girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was tremendously nice, giving a tea-party in my honour.\r\n\r\nThe star actress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear on the stage from the first of the first\r\nact. I thought I would present myself a bit later at the party, when\r\nthey were tattling about my delay.\r\n\r\nI delight in employing such little dramatic arts.\r\n\r\nI dressed all in silk. It\xe2\x80\x99s proper, of course, for a Japanese girl.\r\n\r\nI chose cherry blossoms in preference to roses for my hat. Roses are\r\nacceptable, however, I said in my second thought, for they are given a\r\nthorn against affronters.\r\n\r\nI went to Miss Ada\xe2\x80\x99s looking my best.\r\n\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x94six young ladies in a bunch\xe2\x80\x94stretched out their hands. I was coaxed\r\nby their hailing smile.\r\n\r\nAda kissed me.\r\n\r\nI had no charming manner in receiving a kiss before the people no more\r\nthan in giving one. I blushed miserably. I knew I was bungling.\r\n\r\nO Morning Glory, you are one century late!\r\n\r\nThey besieged me.\r\n\r\nNone of them was so pretty as Ada. Beauty is rare, I perceive, like good\r\ntweezers or ideal men.\r\n\r\nI distributed my Japanese cards.\r\n\r\nAll of my new friends held them upside down.\r\n\r\nIs it a modern vogue to be ignorant?\r\n\r\nAda played skilfully her role of hostess, which was a middle-aged part.\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t even spill the tea in serving. Her \xe2\x80\x9cSugar? Two lumps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsounded fit. She divided her entertaining eye-flashes among us.\r\n\r\nTea is the thing for afternoon, when woman is excused if she be silly.\r\n\r\nWe all undressed our too-tight coat of rhetoric in the sipping of tea.\r\n\r\nWe laughed, and laughed harder, not seeing what we were laughing at.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch all of their names.\r\n\r\nSuch a delicious name as \xe2\x80\x9cLily\xe2\x80\x9d was absurdly given to a girl with red\r\nblotches on her face.\r\n\r\n(A few blemishes are a fascination, however, like slang thrown in the\r\nright place.)\r\n\r\nHer flippancy was like the \xe2\x80\x9cbuku buku\xe2\x80\x9d of a stream.\r\n\r\nLightness didn\xe2\x80\x99t match with her heavy physique.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow lovely an earthquake must be!\xe2\x80\x9d she chirruped. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I go to Japan\r\njust on that account? A jolly moment I had last February. A baby\r\nearthquake visited here, as you know. I was drinking tea. The worst of\r\nit was that I let the cup tumble on to my pink dress. I prayed a whole\r\nweek, nevertheless, to be called again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWoman has nothing to do with a hideous make-up. Miss Lily should not\r\nselect a pink hue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are awful!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI told about the horror of a certain famous Japanese earthquake. They\r\nall breathed out \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was one second of silence.\r\n\r\nAda struck a gushing melody on the piano.\r\n\r\nThe lively Meriken ladies prompted themselves to frisk about.\r\n\r\nI was ready to cry in my destitution.\r\n\r\nOne girl hauled me up violently by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and dance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer arm crawled around my waist, while she directed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight foot\xe2\x80\x94now, left!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI returned to Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99, my thoughts absorbed in a dancing academy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must learn how to skip,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n24th\xe2\x80\x94I hate the alarm clock, simply because it is always so punctual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was too late\xe2\x80\x9d is a delightful expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast is at quarter-past eight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that \xe2\x80\x9cquarter-past\xe2\x80\x9d interesting?\r\n\r\nAnd I can never be ready before nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n25th\xe2\x80\x94I dragged my uncle off to the Chute to enrich my store of zoology.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne gape more, Uncle, to count up one dozen!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and pulled his\r\nmustache in the car.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky that no one saw my act.\r\n\r\nPoor Oji San! Playing chaperon is not a very promising occupation, is\r\nit?\r\n\r\nI stood by the \xe2\x80\x9chappy family\xe2\x80\x9d of monkeys. I tried to descry their point\r\nof view in orations.\r\n\r\nI gave it up.\r\n\r\nThe vain Miss Polly worked hard to bring everybody to an understanding\r\nwith one eternal \xe2\x80\x9cHello, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found such grace in the elephant when he waved his honourable trunk.\r\n\r\nThe stupid Mr. Elephant wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stupid a bit in accepting my present.\r\n\r\nHow philosophically he gazed at me! Very likely I was the first Jap girl\r\nto his audience.\r\n\r\nWhat respectable eyes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll bankrupt yourself in peanuts,\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle warned.\r\n\r\n\r\n26th\xe2\x80\x94A white apron on my black dress makes me so cute.\r\n\r\nI am just suited to be a chambermaid. Shall I volunteer as a servant?\r\n\r\nI bought an apron.\r\n\r\nTo-day is house-cleaning day.\r\n\r\nI kept busy a good while arranging my theatrical costume as a maid.\r\n\r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it fun?\r\n\r\nI was ready to scrub the floor, when I heard \xe2\x80\x9ckotsu kotsu,\xe2\x80\x9d on my door.\r\n\r\nIt was Annie with a broom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m your help. Just a moment! I have forgotten the finishing glance in\r\nmy mirror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n27th\xe2\x80\x94I have been studying the catechism.\r\n\r\nI am afraid to go to church, for the minister may put many a question to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIs Miss Ada a dutiful church-goer?\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\r\n\r\nShe would rather mumble a nigger song than a chapter from the Bible.\r\n\r\nI will ask her a few things from the catechism at my first opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHand me your cup after you are done with your tea!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Browning\r\nrequested. \xe2\x80\x9cI will ponder on your fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nMy fortune?\r\n\r\nI remembered how I used to scatter my pocket money among the\r\nfortune-tellers, pleased to be informed of a lot of nice things.\r\n\r\nWhat meaning she could find in a cup!\r\n\r\nI felt like a mother with her children already in bed, when I dropped my\r\nspoon into my tea.\r\n\r\nI felt mistress of the situation.\r\n\r\nWas there ever anything more welcome than to learn your fortune?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young American (rich, very rich\xe2\x80\x94indeed) will win your affection. The\r\nmarriage will be a happy one,\xe2\x80\x9d she prophesied.\r\n\r\nIs that so?\r\n\r\nLife is becoming very interesting.\r\n\r\nI wonder where my would-be husband is seeking me.\r\n\r\nShall I advertise in a paper?\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nIf my first-rate picture by Mr. Taber were printed, it would be a whole\r\nthing in such a business.\r\n\r\nI thought the picture beautiful enough to sell at any stationer\xe2\x80\x99s of\r\nU.S.A.\r\n\r\nHow many thousand could I sell in a week?\r\n\r\nCould I make money out of it? Some decent fortune, I mean, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n29th\xe2\x80\x94Ho, ho, such a day!\r\n\r\nI was aroused by the roar of a milk-wagon early in the morning.\r\n\r\nI sought a pin in vain.\r\n\r\nI tore my skirt on a sneering nail at the door.\r\n\r\nI upset my flower-vase.\r\n\r\nI sat by my window. A vegetable pedlar howled to me, \xe2\x80\x9cPotatoes?\r\nPotatoes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recall a sweet dream I had last night.\r\n\r\nThe clamour of a Chinese funeral passed under my room. The carriages\r\nwere packed with hired \xe2\x80\x9ccrying women.\xe2\x80\x9d Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a farce?\r\n\r\nI went out. My street-car ran off the track.\r\n\r\nA fire-engine deafened me.\r\n\r\nI passed by an undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s. It was cold like a grave.\r\n\r\nThe sight stunned me.\r\n\r\n\r\n30th\xe2\x80\x94Is my nose high enough?\r\n\r\nI bought a pair of \xe2\x80\x9cnose spectacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose with wires to circle the ears, which are Oriental (that is to say\r\nold-fashioned), would suit even a noseless Formosa Chinee.\r\n\r\nBut how many Japs could show themselves ready for nose spectacles?\r\n\r\nThe Optician asked if they were for myself.\r\n\r\nHe was a trifle uncertain about my nose, I suppose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! For my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nIt was a white lie.\r\n\r\nI blushed as if I had committed a heavy crime.\r\n\r\nI hoped I had not.\r\n\r\nI put my new spectacles on my nose, as soon as I returned to my room.\r\nVery well they stayed. Mother Nature was specially kind to me.\r\n\r\nBut what a depression\xe2\x80\x94also what torture\xe2\x80\x94I felt from their clutch!\r\n\r\nI was pleased, however, seeing myself somewhat scholarly.\r\n\r\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t spectacles an emblem of wisdom?\r\n\r\nThe first requirement to be a critic should be spectacles. The second is\r\na pessimistic smile, of course.\r\n\r\nMy mirror told me that I looked quite modern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBook!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI must see what effect I could produce with a book on my lap.\r\n\r\nI leaped from the chair to fetch one.\r\n\r\nMy spectacles dropped from my honourable nose on to the hearthstone. My\r\nnose was exceedingly stupid.\r\n\r\nAlas, and alas!\r\n\r\nThe spectacles were crushed to pieces.\r\n\r\nI was broken also.\r\n\r\nI buried my face in the pillow for some time.\r\n\r\nThen I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not short in my sight. I have no use for them except\r\nfor fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wiped my disturbed eyes with a handkerchief. My finger felt the rude\r\nmarks printed on both sides of my nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nDec. 1st\xe2\x80\x94I bought a Louisiana lottery ticket through Annie.\r\n\r\nLike any other domestic girl, she has no key to her mouth. She is like a\r\nsentence that has forgotten to add the period.\r\n\r\nI begged all sorts of gods to drop the capital prize on me.\r\n\r\nThirty thousand dollars! Think!\r\n\r\nHow shall I manage with them when I have won?\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd\xe2\x80\x94If I were a painter!\r\n\r\nMy eyes were fixed upon the dying sun. Its solemnity was like the\r\npassing of a mighty king.\r\n\r\nSome time glided by.\r\n\r\nMy thought was pursuing the sun.\r\n\r\nThe twilight!\r\n\r\nOh, twilight pacifying me as with the odour from a magical palace!\r\n\r\nHush!\r\n\r\nThe melody of a piano effused from my neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe best thing in the world is to play music. The very best is to listen\r\nto the profuse melody evoked by a master.\r\n\r\nWas it a superb execution?\r\n\r\nMy soul was dissolved, anyhow, in the rapture.\r\n\r\nI left my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room where I saw the grand sun pass away.\r\n\r\nI put me in my bed, because my visionary mood was not to be stirred for\r\nthe world, and because I wished to dream a romance without the delay of\r\na moment.\r\n\r\nBut I could not slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd I missed my dinner.\r\n\r\nI petitioned my uncle to step out into the street for my beloved\r\nchestnuts.\r\n\r\nDear Italian chestnut vendor!\r\n\r\nI never pass by without buying.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd\xe2\x80\x94We start to-morrow for Los Angeles of Southern California.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Schuyler have invited us to spend some weeks with them.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was the former consul at Yokohama. My uncle is his\r\nintimate friend.\r\n\r\nMy new trunk was brought in from the store.\r\n\r\nIt bears my name in Roman of commanding type.\r\n\r\nI stared at the characters as upon an ancient writing whose meaning\r\ncould only be imagined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98Miss Morning Glory\xe2\x80\x99 suggest that the owner is a charming young\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy little smile smiled, as I thought that it would, of course.\r\n\r\nA new trunk, I am sorry to say, lacks a historical look. An old one is\r\nmore gratifying, like old brocade or an old ring.\r\n\r\nAu revoir, my Ada!\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth-bound train, 4th\xe2\x80\x94I was lavish of my art of \xe2\x80\x9cbothering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy poor uncle\xe2\x80\x94my eternally \xe2\x80\x9cpoor uncle\xe2\x80\x9d was the victim. I wanted some\r\ndiversion at any price.\r\n\r\nHis face scowled as I bored him with my successive questions.\r\n\r\nI thought his irritated face fascinating.\r\n\r\nWhen I presented another question, he was droning a genteel snore.\r\n\r\nI twisted an edge of a newspaper into a roll. I thrust it into his nose.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about his starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBikkurishita!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen he begged to be allowed some chance to rest.\r\n\r\nThis is a \xe2\x80\x9cbad year for cucumbers\xe2\x80\x9d for him. He made a mistake in\r\naccompanying me on Meriken Kenbutsu.\r\n\r\nHonestly I have to behave nicely.\r\n\r\nMy opening question to Uncle was: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the derivation of \xe2\x80\x98damn\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImperialism\xe2\x80\x9d was my last.\r\n\r\nI have a high regard for the people dignified by using the capital \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor the personal pronoun.\r\n\r\nBut if I were the President I should not wish to be addressed with that\r\nhackneyed, unromantic \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cartoonists making sport of the President shock me.\r\n\r\nHow big-hearted the President is!\r\n\r\nThose \xe2\x80\x9cdevils\xe2\x80\x9d would be beheaded in the Orient.\r\n\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, 5th\xe2\x80\x94No one bangs the door at Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe servants drop their eyes meekly before they speak.\r\n\r\nA well-bred atmosphere circulates.\r\n\r\nA woman over forty-five is nothing if she isn\xe2\x80\x99t motherly enough to let\r\none feel at home. Mrs. Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s silence is a smile. I loved her from\r\nmy first glance. I thought I could ask her to wash my hair some sunny\r\nday. I could fancy how pleasant it would be to immerse myself in her\r\nchat\xe2\x80\x94such sort of talk as an old-bonneted \xe2\x80\x9chow to keep house\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94while I\r\nwas drying my hair in the indolence of a sea-nymph. Modern topic is like\r\nblack coffee, it is too stimulating. There is nothing dearer than a\r\ndomestic subject.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in accepting her as my Meriken mother.\r\n\r\nI am positive I would feel more comfortable if I had one in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHow good-naturedly she was fattened!\r\n\r\nA somewhat stout woman looks so proper for a mother.\r\n\r\nI wished I could lean on her plump shoulder from the back in Japanese\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s way, and play with her hair, and ask a few innocent questions\r\nlike \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to eat for dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe talked about the Japanese woman, principally praising her shapely\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nI felt conceitedly, because I was given one classical little mouth, if I\r\nhad nothing else to be noticed.\r\n\r\nMr. Schuyler grasped my hand ever so hard. My hand was buried in his\r\npalm. His manner was courteously boyish.\r\n\r\nHis body is erect like a redwood.\r\n\r\nSuch an old gentleman gives me the impression of another race from the\r\ndivine realm of everlasting youth. A Jap after fifty is capped with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cretired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the work of the American gentleman is only finished when he dies.\r\n\r\nGreat Meriken Jin!\r\n\r\nMr. Schuyler shows more civility to his servants than to his wife.\r\n\r\nHere I can study the typical household of America\xe2\x80\x99s best caste.\r\n\r\n\r\n6th\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnata donata?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rubbed my dreamy eyes, scanning my room.\r\n\r\nWho was the Japanese speaker?\r\n\r\nI crept to the door, and opened it slightly.\r\n\r\nNot a soul was there.\r\n\r\nI heard the trivial clatter of the kitchen stepping up.\r\n\r\nI dipped into my bed again. I smiled sceptically, thinking that I must\r\nhave been dreaming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGokigen ikaga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was addressed again by the same voice.\r\n\r\nI said that there was positively some mischief in my room.\r\n\r\nI leaped down from the bed.\r\n\r\nI inspected my slippers. I made sure there was nothing strange under the\r\npictures on the wall. I tugged at the drawers. I tumbled every blanket.\r\nI pried in the pitcher.\r\n\r\nI sat on the bed wrapped in fog.\r\n\r\nThe blind rustled.\r\n\r\nThe sunbeams crawled in marvellously.\r\n\r\nThen I was frightened by another speech, \xe2\x80\x9cNihonjin desu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI declared that it flew in from the outside.\r\n\r\nI rolled up the blind.\r\n\r\nOya, oya! There was a parrot perching in a cage by my window!\r\n\r\nHe adjusted his showy coat first, and then sent me his inquisitive eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnata donata?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning Glory is my insignificant name, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nA trifling toss of his head showed his satisfaction in my name. I\r\nthought he was trying to set me at ease with his smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGokigen ikaga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel splendidly, thank you, Mr. Parrot!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nThen pressing his head backward he looked haughtily at me with fixed\r\neyes, and announced:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNihonjin desu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m also a Jap,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered.\r\n\r\nHe was the most profound Japanese scholar, Mrs. Schuyler said, in all\r\nLos Angeles. Mr. Schuyler Jr. brought him from Kobe last spring.\r\n\r\nI told her the incident of this morning.\r\n\r\nShe laughed, she said she expected it.\r\n\r\nBad Mother Schuyler!\r\n\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94Dear Baby! Kawaii koto!\r\n\r\nI hugged the baby of Mrs. Schuyler Jr. and kissed it.\r\n\r\nHer husband is away in Japan for the tea business.\r\n\r\nIt was the darling baby, I thank the gods, who received my first kiss.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly to stamp love with a kiss. Lips are the portal of the\r\nhuman heart.\r\n\r\nKiss is sweet.\r\n\r\nI say that it marks an epoch in the spiritual evolution of the Japanese\r\nwhen they learn what a kiss is\xe2\x80\x94but not how to kiss.\r\n\r\nThe baby crawled like a sportive crab. It orationed. It! I felt sorry\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d would soon be changed to \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cShe.\xe2\x80\x9d It caught sight of a\r\npiece of burnt match in the course of its expedition. It turned its way\r\nand clinched it with its fingers. It hastened to the mother to exhibit\r\nit, and waited patiently with its great game for Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s praise.\r\n\r\nI nearly cried in my excitement at such a pathetic revelation.\r\n\r\nLovely thing!\r\n\r\nThe baby had blue eyes.\r\n\r\nMy preference wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for blue eyes. I often snapped at them, saying that\r\nthey were like a dead fish\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nBut how long can I keep up my ill-will, when I look with delight upon\r\nthe blueness in water, sky and mountain?\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it precious to see the blue pictures on china?\r\n\r\nA blue pencil is just the thing to mark on the margin of a pleasing\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nBlue is a poetical hue.\r\n\r\nRobert Burns was blue-eyed.\r\n\r\nI recalled the first American I met in Tokio, who seriously questioned\r\nwhether it was a fact that Japs butcher a blue-eyed baby.\r\n\r\nBakabakashii wa!\r\n\r\nJapan has no blue eye.\r\n\r\nAnd Japanese are worshippers of any sort of baby.\r\n\r\nIf American babies were like Chinese girls!\r\n\r\nI would pile up all my coins to buy one.\r\n\r\nMeriken baby understood how to smile before how to cry. It is a lady or\r\ngentleman already.\r\n\r\nI will serve as baby\xe2\x80\x99s nurse if I must support myself.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a high task to be useful to the baby, and watch its growth as a\r\nsilent astronomer watches the stars.\r\n\r\nI wish I could roll the baby\xe2\x80\x99s carriage day after day.\r\n\r\nHow sweetly the world would be turning then!\r\n\r\nShall I hire Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s baby for one day?\r\n\r\n\r\n8th\xe2\x80\x94Is there any more gratifying word than dinner?\r\n\r\nI had a \xe2\x80\x9chipp goo\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d dinner. (Permit a Chinese-English expression for\r\nonce.)\r\n\r\nIts inviting heaviness was like an honourable poem by Milton.\r\n\r\nSchuyler\xe2\x80\x99s house has a Miltonic presence.\r\n\r\nElectric light is too imposing.\r\n\r\nCandelabra are like a moon whose beams are a lenitive song.\r\n\r\nThe nude shoulders of Mrs. Schuyler, Jr., crimsoned in the rays from the\r\ncandelabra.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of some part of the skin is the highest order of art. How\r\nto show it is just as serious a study as how to clothe it.\r\n\r\nIf I had such supreme shoulders as hers, I would not pause before\r\ndisplaying them.\r\n\r\nWhat falling shoulders are mine!\r\n\r\nThe slope of the shoulders is prized in Japan. Amerikey is another\r\ncountry, you know.\r\n\r\nI appeared at the dinner in my native gown.\r\n\r\nThe things on the table had a high-toned excellence.\r\n\r\nI will not forget to have my initials engraved if I happen to buy any\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nCoffee was served. I felt that an old age had returned, when eating was\r\nonly a dissipation.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m growing to love Meriken food.\r\n\r\nI am glad that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any musty pudding at Schuylers\xe2\x80\x99, a sight that\r\nmakes me ten years older.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing I hate is the smell of cabbage.\r\n\r\nHow pleased I was to see a \xe2\x80\x9cchabu chabu\xe2\x80\x9d of shallow water in my finger\r\nbowl! Just a glimpse of water is tasty.\r\n\r\nOur taciturn butler retired from the dining-room with graceful dignity.\r\n\r\nThe butler has ceased to be a common servant. He has advanced, I\r\nsuppose, to the rank of an ornament of the Meriken household.\r\n\r\nThe sister of Mother Schuyler and her husband dined with us.\r\n\r\nThe funniest thing about her was that she kept a few long hairs on her\r\ncheek. They grew from a mole.\r\n\r\nIt may be good luck to preserve them.\r\n\r\nHer husband was surprised when he heard that we do not use knife and\r\nfork at home.\r\n\r\nBamboo chop-sticks! How dear!\r\n\r\n\r\n9th\xe2\x80\x94I have no belief in the earring.\r\n\r\nIt is a savage mode, like the deformed feet of the Chinese woman.\r\n\r\nBut why did the Meriken lady discard her veil?\r\n\r\nHer face behind the veil would appear like a rose through the Spring\r\nmist. It is a charming thing as ever was fashioned for woman.\r\n\r\nI have seen no lady with a veil in this town.\r\n\r\nI suppose the Los Angeles women confide in their faces.\r\n\r\nThey strew more liberty in their grace than the San Franciscans.\r\n\r\nTheir beauty is informal.\r\n\r\nThe city is enchanting.\r\n\r\nI am pleased that I am not shown here so many a \xe2\x80\x9cTo Let\xe2\x80\x9d as in Frisco.\r\n\r\nEven the barefooted Arabs, those street sparrows, are quite a picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n10th\xe2\x80\x94I promised Mrs. Schuyler, Jr., good care of her baby for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nI carried it firm on my arms.\r\n\r\nI jogged out to the garden.\r\n\r\nThe baby faced toward me and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBu, bu! Bu, bu, bu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt grateful, thinking that it counted me among its friends.\r\n\r\nI laid its head on my breast.\r\n\r\nI sang a little Japanese lullaby:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \xe2\x80\x9cNenneko, nenneko,\r\n                            Nennekoyo!\r\n                            Oraga akanbowa\r\n                            Itsudekita?\r\n                            Sangatsu sakurano\r\n                            Sakutokini!\r\n                            Doride okawoga.\r\n                            Sakurairo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sleep, sleep, sleep! When was our baby made? Third month, when the\r\ncherry blossoms. So the honourable face of our child is cherry-blossom\r\ncoloured.)\r\n\r\nThe breezes billed and cooed upon the grasses. An imperial palm cast its\r\nrich shadow.\r\n\r\nThe affectionate sunlight made me think of a \xe2\x80\x9clittle Spring\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nJapanese September. Everything inclined to a siesta in the yellow air.\r\n\r\nA tropical touch is the touch of passion.\r\n\r\nCan you fancy this is the month of December?\r\n\r\nI cannot.\r\n\r\nAfter I put the baby to its nurse, I paced around a bronze statue upon\r\nthe lawn, losing myself in Greek beauty.\r\n\r\nThen I snatched a rose.\r\n\r\nI pressed it to my nose-tip.\r\n\r\n\r\n12th\xe2\x80\x94Where\xe2\x80\x99s my painstaking description of Echo Mountain?\r\n\r\nI made a pleasant trip there yesterday with Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s party.\r\n\r\nI lost my writing penned last night.\r\n\r\nSuch a heedless tomboy!\r\n\r\nI idled, watching a spider from my window. It was framing a net amid the\r\ngarden trees. An awfully dignified tom cat glared from under a bush. I\r\nwas sorry no game came upon the scene to his honour. My profound\r\nJapanese scholar was not discouraged by the lack of an audience. He was\r\nbusy presenting his polite \xe2\x80\x9cGokigen ikaga?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I found what I did with my yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s diary.\r\n\r\nAreda mono!\r\n\r\nI wiped my oily hands with it and buried it in a trash basket.\r\n\r\nI fixed my hair this morning.\r\n\r\nMorning Glory San, you have to keep your Nikki in a safe!\r\n\r\nGreat Carlyle wrote his \xe2\x80\x9cFrench Revolution\xe2\x80\x9d twice.\r\n\r\nI wish I had been given a slice of his persistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n13th\xe2\x80\x94A Bishop visited and lunched with us.\r\n\r\nBishop! How I desired to meet one!\r\n\r\nIt had been my fancy, ever since I read of the venerable Bishop who\r\nthrew out candle-sticks to Jean Valjean in Hugo\xe2\x80\x99s book.\r\n\r\nHis name was Myriel.\r\n\r\nWhat is my friend\xe2\x80\x99s name? After a man reaches the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s see, his own\r\nname should retire from actual service. People call him \xe2\x80\x9cBishop!\r\nBishop!\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were a nickname.\r\n\r\nMy bishop had a holy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this good man who is staring at me?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself at first\r\nsight, as Napoleon said when he saw Myriel.\r\n\r\nA young churchman is unnatural.\r\n\r\nThe customarily pessimistic face of the Japanese priest causes aversion.\r\n\r\nI got what I wanted in my new friend.\r\n\r\nIf I were his daughter, I would comb his silken hair before he goes to\r\nchurch on Sunday.\r\n\r\nI was glad he was not thin.\r\n\r\nHo, ho, ho! He ate meat like anybody else.\r\n\r\nHe would seem holier if he merely bit a crust of bread, and sipped three\r\nspoonfuls of tea.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon we strolled through the garden arm in arm.\r\n\r\nNot a bit I blushed. I was as completely at ease with him as with my\r\npapa.\r\n\r\nHe told me of the beauty of Christ. His soft, deep voice was as from a\r\nfar-away forest.\r\n\r\nI plucked a few stems of violets. I fitted them to his buttonhole.\r\n\r\nSuch a little thing pleased him immensely.\r\n\r\nDear, simple Bishop!\r\n\r\nI digested what he spoke. I declared that Christianity was the sun,\r\nwhile Buddhism was the moon.\r\n\r\nThe sun is day and life, and the moon night and rest.\r\n\r\nHow can we live without the sun? The moon is poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th\xe2\x80\x94The sky became low, its colour frowning gray.\r\n\r\nThe winds snarled.\r\n\r\nDecember was suddenly calling us.\r\n\r\nWe sat by a snug fire at evening.\r\n\r\nIts yellow flame suggested a preacher uplifting his hands in prayer. The\r\nfire flickered in jollity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPachi, pachi, pachi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe parlour was not lighted.\r\n\r\nThe pictures on the wall were impressive in the firelight.\r\n\r\nAny woman looks charming at night and by the fireside. I felt happy\r\nimagining that I must appear lovely.\r\n\r\nThe fireplace is so dear, like mamma\xe2\x80\x99s lap.\r\n\r\nMr. Schuyler brought a chess-board and challenged.\r\n\r\nI offered me for a fight.\r\n\r\nI used to play American chess with a Meriken missionary who lived in my\r\nneighbourhood. I thought it fun to beat an old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNamu Tenshoko Daijingu!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman asked what I muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind! Only a little spell!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied in the lightest fashion.\r\n\r\nThe chess-board was placed between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Schuyler, can you sacrifice anything for the game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you please, my little woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you make Mrs. Schuyler your stake! My uncle will be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha! Very well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a tactician. I fought hard.\r\n\r\nAlas, my game was lost!\r\n\r\nMy second stake was myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that I may marry you, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIyani natta!\r\n\r\nHe was far superior.\r\n\r\nOya, oya, I was a loser again!\r\n\r\nI looked sadly on my uncle, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, you cannot return home! We are the property of Mr. Schuyler.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it really too bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n15th\xe2\x80\x94Shall I make a little kimono for Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s baby?\r\n\r\nIt would be a souvenir of my visit.\r\n\r\nThe crape kept in the Jap stores of this town isn\xe2\x80\x99t appropriate for a\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbebe.\xe2\x80\x9d My flower-dyed under-kimono should be utilized.\r\n\r\nI opened my trunk.\r\n\r\nMother Schuyler brought in a young lady. She was her niece, that is to\r\nsay the daughter of Mrs. Ellis. Mrs. Ellis is the one with the long hair\r\non her cheek.\r\n\r\nI told them of my new drift.\r\n\r\nThey were surprised at my determination.\r\n\r\nMiss Olive applied to be my pupil in Japanese sewing.\r\n\r\nWhat a southern name! Olive perfectly fits for a girl born in the\r\npassionate breeze.\r\n\r\nHer \xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d fluttered affectionately like golden\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schuyler bade her servant to move in the machine.\r\n\r\nI objected.\r\n\r\nMachine-clicking is not Oriental. The \xe2\x80\x9cbebe\xe2\x80\x9d has to be done in pure\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n16th\xe2\x80\x94I found a hammock on the veranda.\r\n\r\nIt is the thing for summer, of course.\r\n\r\nI never laid me in it before in my life.\r\n\r\nI thought that I would see how I would feel.\r\n\r\nI hanged it.\r\n\r\nI romped in it.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful. I fancied that we\xe2\x80\x94I and who?\xe2\x80\x94hammocked among the\r\nsummer breezes. Then a star appeared. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful the star\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did I fancy next?\r\n\r\nOh, never mind!\r\n\r\nI tossed my feet. The skirt fluttered. My new satin slippers\xe2\x80\x94number one\r\nand a half\xe2\x80\x94were all seen. I drew up my skirt a little, and made a whole\r\nshow of my honourable legs.\r\n\r\nI prayed that somebody would pass by to fling an adoring glance at them.\r\n\r\nNo one roamed along. I scorned my frivolity.\r\n\r\nThe Bible by me wasn\xe2\x80\x99t open at all.\r\n\r\nI decided to read it to-day, although religion isn\xe2\x80\x99t so becoming.\r\n\r\nMy Bishop sent it this morning. Dear old Bishop! He thought me quite a\r\ndocile \xe2\x80\x9cnenne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stretched my body in the hammock.\r\n\r\nAlas, ma!\r\n\r\nMy hana kanzashi with the butterflies was caught by the meshes. The\r\nwings of one butterfly were tortured. Yes, I had put a Japanese pin on\r\nmy hair this morning.\r\n\r\nI hoped I could pay a bit more attention to my head all the time.\r\n\r\nI was sad for a while.\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94Good Annie wrote me from Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nWhat a scrawl!\r\n\r\nBut woman\xe2\x80\x99s bad grammar and infirm penmanship are pathetic, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink so?\r\n\r\nIt might look better on a thin blue tablet.\r\n\r\nBut poor Annie chose such thick smooth paper.\r\n\r\nOya! What?\r\n\r\nA five-dollar check?\r\n\r\nMy goodness, I had forgotten all about my lottery! Even the ticket I\r\nhave lost. It drew out five dollars.\r\n\r\nWhy not thirty thousand dollars?\r\n\r\nIt was better than a blank, anyway, I said philosophically.\r\n\r\nNow let me send a little present to my home!\r\n\r\nA little thing is a deal sweeter.\r\n\r\nI ordered fourteen packets of N. Y. Central Park lawn seed from a\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\nNew York Central Park!\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it sound grand?\r\n\r\nAnd other flower seeds also.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf sweet pea is named \xe2\x80\x9cCupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt will be no wonder if my father mistakes it for a kibisho.\r\n\r\nCupid is a handsome boy, not a bullfrog-looking teapot, funny papa!\r\n\r\nHe is garden crazy. I can imagine how conceited he will be showing\r\naround his western sea flowers when they are in bloom.\r\n\r\nI asked my uncle to translate the directions.\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it handy to keep a secretary?\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll not miss signing my name on the translation.\r\n\r\nMy daddy may think it was done by myself.\r\n\r\nWoman is a snob.\r\n\r\nNow what for mamma?\r\n\r\n\r\n18th\xe2\x80\x94Mother Schuyler took me to her church.\r\n\r\nSuch a heathen me!\r\n\r\nI felt that I was \xe2\x80\x9csitting on needles,\xe2\x80\x9d when I slipped into the Meriken\r\nchurch without glancing at even one page of the Bible. It was as risky a\r\nventure as to face an examination before fitting.\r\n\r\nThe service hadn\xe2\x80\x99t begun.\r\n\r\nMany ladies were introduced to me by Mrs. Schuyler.\r\n\r\nThey talked about\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x94anything but religion.\r\n\r\nI was fanned continually by an offensive odor. Some one had left her\r\nperfume at home.\r\n\r\nHonourable arm-pit smell!\r\n\r\nAmerikey cultivates many a disagreeable sort of thing, doubtless.\r\n\r\nThe ladies seemed to regard the church as another drawing parlor.\r\n\r\nMy mind was calmed within ten minutes.\r\n\r\nUreshiya!\r\n\r\nThe Meriken church is not a difficult place at all.\r\n\r\nA Japanese church is ever so sad-faced. No woman under thirty is seen\r\nthere. I laughed at the thought of an \xe2\x80\x9cincense-smelling\xe2\x80\x9d young girl.\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange that Meriken girls love the church?\r\n\r\nIs it because they cannot marry without it?\r\n\r\nSunday amusement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t begin before noon. What would girls do if there\r\nwere no church where they could burst into song?\r\n\r\nHow classically the bald head of the minister shone!\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more pleasing than a sweeping sermon on a bright day.\r\n\r\nBut my mind strayed, wondering why all those ladies were so homely.\r\n\r\nI snatched my hat off, wishing to be different from the rest.\r\n\r\nI fancied the reason why their hats were eternally glued to their heads\r\nwas because their hair was never in first-rate order for exhibition.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I used to steal into a Buddha temple, being a little\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cotenba,\xe2\x80\x9d and tap an idol\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you getting\r\nalong, Hotoke Sama?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot one idol here!\r\n\r\nNo incense!\r\n\r\nHow uninteresting!\r\n\r\nHow silly I was inventing some clever thing for the occasion when I\r\nshould be forced to confess! The church was not Catholic.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned home, Mrs. Schuyler asked me what was the text.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made as if I had been a listener to the sermon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mrs. Schuyler, what was it?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed as if I had accidentally\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n19th\xe2\x80\x94Miss Olive offered to show me how to play golf.\r\n\r\nI went to her home at Pasadena.\r\n\r\nPasadena is a luxurious Winter resort of cheerful aspect.\r\n\r\nIts water is blessed.\r\n\r\nEven the street cars run like a well-bred gentleman. The dog never\r\ngrowls around. It only wags its tail. No beggars.\r\n\r\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s outdoor diversion demands a great deal of strength.\r\n\r\nWhat an imbecile \xe2\x80\x9canego!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen minutes I found two bean-like blisters on each palm.\r\n\r\nI gave up the game.\r\n\r\nI bought a golf outfit, nevertheless, in a store on my way home. The\r\nsight of a lady carrying it once stamped itself on my mind as so\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nWhat attire would be becoming to me?\r\n\r\nI said that my waist should be of deep red wool. Skirt? It must also be\r\nof wool, of course, with a large checkerboard pattern. Silk isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngamesome, is it? And the hat should be a mouse-coloured felt, which must\r\nbe thrust carelessly by my big gold pin with a coral head.\r\n\r\nI well-nigh decided to dye my hair red.\r\n\r\nWhat will my uncle say?\r\n\r\n\r\n20th\xe2\x80\x94Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s cook wasn\xe2\x80\x99t acquainted with the art of rice-cooking.\r\n\r\nMother Schuyler said explanatorily that she had never tasted properly\r\ncooked rice since the day at Yokohama.\r\n\r\nThe rice was pasty.\r\n\r\nI thought I would boil the rice according to Japanese prescription for\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x99s dinner.\r\n\r\nI stepped down to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nI put three cupfuls of rice in a saucepan, and dipped my hand in it, and\r\nsupplied water as much as to my wrist.\r\n\r\nI placed it on the splendid fire till the agitated water pushed up the\r\nlid. Then I moved it on to a gentle fire. The cooking was done after\r\ntwenty minutes.\r\n\r\nI was honoured by everybody at the dinner. The rice was singularly fine.\r\nThe grains kept their own perfect shapes.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner I approached Mrs. Schuyler with ink and paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you write your recommendation of my rice-cooking?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at me questioningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny girl! What shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I dictated solemnly thus:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c_To whom it may concern:_\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI highly recommend Miss Morning Glory with her honourable art\r\n    of rice-cooking. Her method is Japanese, that is to say, the\r\n    best in the world.\r\n\r\n                   MRS. SCHUYLER\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n21st:\xe2\x80\x94Without a nephew Mother Schuyler wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a complete old dear.\r\n\r\nShe has one fortunately.\r\n\r\nOlive San told me a whole lot about her great brother.\r\n\r\nHe is a promising artist.\r\n\r\nArtist?\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t an artist affect boorish hair? I was anxious to know how his\r\nhair was, because I hated anything long except a frock-coat.\r\n\r\nMiss Olive declared him one handsome boy. (I thought how ridiculous is\r\nthe American girl to praise her brother. It is Japanese etiquette to\r\nundervalue one\xe2\x80\x99s relatives in describing them.)\r\n\r\nI finished my imaginary sketch of his face before we intruded in his\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\nOlive presented me to him.\r\n\r\nHe was a comely young man.\r\n\r\nWhat gratified me most about him was his shapely shoes, well-polished.\r\n\r\nHe knew how to talk with girls.\r\n\r\nI was instantly put on unceremonious terms.\r\n\r\nHow beautifully he once slipped \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\xe2\x80\x9d in addressing me! His\r\ngracefully-sounding \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, I mean Miss Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d pleased me\r\nenormously.\r\n\r\nI told him that it was a regular humbug to be particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will call you Oscar, shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, winking.\r\n\r\nI felt some fervid water oozing down my cheeks. I was blushing.\r\n\r\nI was glad that he was not Mr. Ellis, Jr. The word \xe2\x80\x9cJr.\xe2\x80\x9d appears to me\r\nlike a ragged papa\xe2\x80\x99s old coat which is dreadfully out of fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me paint you?\xe2\x80\x9d he requested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I beautiful enough, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, dropping my eyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly too charming!\xe2\x80\x9d he said bravely.\r\n\r\nI always think every gentleman whom I meet falls in love with me.\r\n\r\nI regarded Mr. Oscar Ellis already as an adorer.\r\n\r\nO sentimental Morning Glory!\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s my mind was completely occupied with an\r\nabsurd fancy.\r\n\r\nI was thinking what I shall do when he proposes to me. Shall I say yes?\r\n\r\nFor a girl to fall in love with one while she is staying at his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t romantic a bit, is it?\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care, anyhow, for an artist lover.\r\n\r\nIt is a worn-out hero in old fiction.\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t the word \xe2\x80\x9cartist\xe2\x80\x9d ring like a synonym for poverty?\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Ellis invited me to dinner.\r\n\r\nI went to Pasadena with Mrs. Schuyler, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe evening was fragrant.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner we stepped out to the garden. It was dusky.\r\n\r\nBy and by, twenty Japanese lanterns were candled among the trees in my\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nI was in a sprightly bent.\r\n\r\nI was whispering a little Jap song, when Oscar led out two donkeys.\r\n\r\nOlive sprang upon the back of one in gracious audacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJump, Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI was wavering about my action, when I felt Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s firm arms around my\r\nwaist. My small body was lifted on to the donkey\xe2\x80\x99s by his careless\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\nWhat a sensation ran through me! It was the first occasion to put me\r\ninto so close contact with a Meriken young man.\r\n\r\nMy skirt was caught by the saddle. I made a whole exhibition of my leg.\r\n\r\nBut I was glad the stocking was beautiful.\r\n\r\nOscar held my bridle, pacing by my side.\r\n\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\nMy donkey acted awfully.\r\n\r\nDid he take it as a degradation to be whipped by a Jap?\r\n\r\nSuddenly it dropped its honourable rump. I should have been pitifully\r\nthrown out, if my arm had not seized Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s neck. I looked\r\napologetically at him. He turned his delighted face.\r\n\r\nI could not stay a minute longer.\r\n\r\nWhen I got me off from the donkey, I observed the new moon over my right\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood luck!\xe2\x80\x9d Olive San said.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nMr. Oscar began to whistle somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo pop pop pop, ho pop pop pa!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n23rd\xe2\x80\x94To-day is Mrs. Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s reception day.\r\n\r\nShe set two Japanese screens in the drawing room, moving them from her\r\nchamber. She sprinkled a great lot of exotic bric-a-bric about.\r\n\r\nShe opened a regular Chinese bazar which expressed every poor taste.\r\nSuch confusion!\r\n\r\nI fancied she wanted the callers to recollect that she was Mrs.\r\nEx-Consul of the Orient.\r\n\r\nJapan teaches nothing but simplicity. Simplicity is the philosophy of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nI wondered how she lived there without learning it.\r\n\r\nEvery inch of Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s parlour means a heap of money.\r\n\r\nBut is there anything more displeasing than tasteless luxury?\r\nSufficiency is grateful, but superfluity is nothing but offence.\r\n\r\nI thought that Americans buy things because they love to buy, not\r\nbecause they have to buy.\r\n\r\nMeriken jin has to study the high art of concealing.\r\n\r\nThe brown people look upon the scattering of things (however costly they\r\nbe) as lower than barbarity. Japs believe in the sublimity of space.\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it delightful to sit on the new matting of a Japanese guest-room?\r\nIts fresh whiteness used to cure my headache.\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it taste to place just one seasonable picture on the tokonoma?\r\n\r\nSo many a Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Smith called.\r\n\r\nThey surrounded me.\r\n\r\nI asked myself whether they paid a visit to Mother Schuyler or to me.\r\n\r\nThey incessantly threw the following questions at me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you like America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long do you expect to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch an inquisitive Meriken woman!\r\n\r\nI wished I had been bright enough to print a slip with my reply.\r\n\r\nEach lady wore four rings at least.\r\n\r\nAre they real things?\r\n\r\nDiamond is hardly my choice. Haughtily cold, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nI declared that their shapeless fingers were not fit to show without\r\nembellishment.\r\n\r\nIf I had money for a ring I would use it for 365 pairs of silk\r\nstockings. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a joy to change every day?\r\n\r\nSchuyler\xe2\x80\x99s baby made a hit with its kimono.\r\n\r\nAll the ladies kissed and kissed.\r\n\r\nThe baby wondered at their act, rolling its eyes.\r\n\r\nMother Schuyler was quite fussy with a little speech about the history\r\nof its Japanese gown.\r\n\r\nFunny old dear!\r\n\r\n\r\n24th\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Oscar Ellis came to paint me.\r\n\r\nDear Oscar!\r\n\r\nI have never before left my face alone for such a close scrutiny.\r\n\r\nI was restless at first, fancying that he was gathering all my flaws.\r\n\r\nThen it happened in my thought that his absorption had something of\r\nreligious devotion in it.\r\n\r\nI grew easy.\r\n\r\nI began to feel like a star with all the admirers in the earth.\r\n\r\nA garden tree sent its shadow through the window. The time passed as\r\ngracefully as a fairy on tiptoe. The air was purple.\r\n\r\nOscar San chatted freely.\r\n\r\nI never took the part of a listener before in my life. I found listening\r\nhonourable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you like the Oriental woman?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHe said American beauty was rather external, like a street shop window.\r\nHe would like to know, he said, if there was any word more pathetic than\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csayonara.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t the Japanese woman like it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nI thought he was correct.\r\n\r\nHe continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read in a modern poet the following lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x98 .... full of whispers and of shadows,\r\n             Thou art what all the winds have uttered not,\r\n             What the still night suggesteth to the heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the vague Japanese beauty in my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so nobly sweet, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe cast a strong look, as if he were trying to put his final judgment\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nHe moved his brush slowly on the canvas.\r\n\r\nI bowed a profound bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGomen kudasai!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nAnd I laid me on the floor, stretching out my legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Genjiro Yeto\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cSO YOU LIKE THE ORIENTAL WOMAN?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n25th\xe2\x80\x94I bought two dolls.\r\n\r\nOne for Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s baby, as my Christmas gift.\r\n\r\nI slept with the other last night. I squeezed my ear to the dolly,\r\nfancying I might hear a few scratches of human voice. I kissed it. I\r\nlaughed, saying that the doll was the thing for my starting to learn how\r\nto kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep till mamma comes back, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d I said in the morning when I\r\nstepped down for my breakfast.\r\n\r\nI left the table before I had half-finished, on account of my anxiety\r\nlest the upstairs girl might tattle of my childishness, if she found the\r\ndoll in my bed.\r\n\r\nThank Heavens!\r\n\r\nThe girl hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come around yet.\r\n\r\nI locked it up in my trunk.\r\n\r\nWhat name shall I give it?\r\n\r\nCharley?\r\n\r\nI was disgusted at the thought, because every Chinee\xe2\x80\x94ten thousand\r\nMongols in all\xe2\x80\x94is named one Charley.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas, all of you!\r\n\r\n\r\n26th\xe2\x80\x94It rained.\r\n\r\nI implored Mother Schuyler to select a book from her library.\r\n\r\nAll the literature was packed in there, beginning with Socrates, sane as\r\na silver dollar.\r\n\r\nEvery book was without finger-marks. Book without finger-mark is like\r\nbread without brown crust. Dear finger-mark!\r\n\r\nThe fashion is to buy books and to glance at their covers, I suppose,\r\nbut not to read them. Modern publications aren\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be read, are\r\nthey? The authors have degenerated to the place of upholsterers. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit a shame?\r\n\r\nMrs. Schuyler picked out for me \xe2\x80\x9cRubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle said: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican woman can\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from Omar and\r\nchicken-salad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to peruse it.\r\n\r\nThe raindrops by my window tuned:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTap, tap, tip, tap, tap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thumped the book on the floor, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Khayyam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRubaiyat is a menace against civilisation.\r\n\r\nAmericanism is nothing but the delight in life and the world.\r\n\r\nI wonder why the wise government of Washington does not oppose its pagan\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nIt is leprosy.\r\n\r\nBut I thought how truly true was his \xe2\x80\x9cI came like Water, and like Wind I\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took up the book and opened it again.\r\n\r\nThen I shut it.\r\n\r\nI listened to the \xe2\x80\x9cTap, tap, tip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it sound like a wan voice of Omar?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\n\r\n27th\xe2\x80\x94A lady whom I met at Mrs. Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s reception sent me a mass of\r\ndistinguished roses.\r\n\r\nLoving American!\r\n\r\nI said I would arrange them in Japanese cult.\r\n\r\nMy style is the enshin.\r\n\r\nAmerikey is destitute of flowers.\r\n\r\nNippon is known as a paradise of botanists. The \xe2\x80\x9cscientists\xe2\x80\x9d of flower\r\ndecoration (if I may call them so) are given a great advantage in their\r\ncraft of delineating beauty.\r\n\r\nThe rose is not much of a flower to the Jap mind.\r\n\r\nThey never employ it in their work. It has no grace of line. Its perfume\r\ncannot indemnify for its being thorny. Things not qualified to convey\r\ncharm are declined from the tokonama.\r\n\r\nI love roses awfully well myself.\r\n\r\nI will make the best of them in my art.\r\n\r\nIs there any proper vase in Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s house?\r\n\r\nMother Schuyler fetched me two pieces.\r\n\r\nOne was a silver vase and the other a china one.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use them, I was sorry. Silver was commercial-looking. The\r\npainting on the china a hodge-podge of a joss house.\r\n\r\nThen I was seized with a thought.\r\n\r\nI ran down to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nI borrowed an old scrubbing bucket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a soft antique hue!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed with delight.\r\n\r\nI elected one imperial rose and one little one for a \xe2\x80\x9cretainer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fixed them in the bucket.\r\n\r\nI thought it was verily the simplicity of the illustrious Mr. Rikiu.\r\n\r\nI presented the rest of the roses to Mrs. Schuyler, Jr.\r\n\r\nShe stared at the bucket without a word. I knew that her silence was the\r\nmost forcible irony. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of setting such a bucket on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeriken jins don\xe2\x80\x99t know any art!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when she left.\r\n\r\nMy uncle begged me not to act so fantastically.\r\n\r\n\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a shamisen, Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d Mother Schuyler cried from the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nI darted out of my room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShamisen?\r\n\r\nIt is a three-stringed guitar of Japan.\r\n\r\nMr. Schuyler, Jr., had sent it from Yokohama, as she explained.\r\n\r\nShe wished me to tinkle a little gamboling music in the parlour before\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard implement to handle. It has no notation. Attainment is\r\nthrough unending blind practice.\r\n\r\nI was compelled to learn by mother, many a year ago, but I soon gave it\r\nup for an English spelling-book.\r\n\r\nBut I daresay I can play.\r\n\r\nI regulated the key to begin with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTing, ting! Chang, Chang, ting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat to hum, Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, facing aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove ditty is desirable,\xe2\x80\x9d Oji San considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fancy me a geisha!\xe2\x80\x9d I said in defending laughter.\r\n\r\nThen I murmured an old hauta, \xe2\x80\x9cHaori kakushite,\xe2\x80\x9d which was Englished by\r\nsome one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cShe hid his coat,\r\n                She plucked his sleeve,\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98To-day you cannot go!\r\n                To-day, at least, you will not leave,\r\n                  The heart that loves you so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n                  The mado she undid\r\n                  And back the shoji slid:\r\n                And clinging cried, \xe2\x80\x98Dear Lord, perceive\r\n                  The whole world is snow!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n29th\xe2\x80\x94We went to a theatre last evening.\r\n\r\nDear, classical \xe2\x80\x9cflower path\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\n\r\nHow I missed it in the Meriken stage!\r\n\r\nFlower path?\r\n\r\nIt is a projection into the auditorium used to represent when one starts\r\nout of the house or returns.\r\n\r\nSo the American stage has no front gate scene! Every one enters very\r\nlikely from the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nThe stage never turns round like the Japanese stage.\r\n\r\nOh, dear, iyadawa!\r\n\r\nAmerican play has too much kissing. Each time I was electrified.\r\n\r\nThe pit was filled with a well-behaved throng. All the ladies took off\r\ntheir hats. Do they pay more respect than in church? The gentlemen never\r\nwhiffed smoke.\r\n\r\nJapan theatre is a hurly-burly.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cboys\xe2\x80\x9d roar up \xe2\x80\x9cHonourable tea\xe2\x80\x94O\xe2\x80\x99cha wa yoroshi? Honourable cake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe attendants of tea houses bow around to the beneficent habitues, like\r\ninclining puppets.\r\n\r\nWomen sob. They laugh, stuffing their sleeves into their mouths. They\r\nare ready to put themselves in the play. They are sentimental.\r\n\r\nMeriken women place themselves above the play.\r\n\r\nI doubted whether they were criticising or enjoying.\r\n\r\nSome lady even used a spy-glass to examine the face of a player.\r\n\r\nI thought it decidedly an impertinence.\r\n\r\nWhat a pry!\r\n\r\nI will not act to such an assembly, if I ever happen to be an actress.\r\n\r\nWhat was the title of the play?\r\n\r\nI could hardly understand half of it.\r\n\r\nI tried hard to swallow my gape.\r\n\r\n\r\n30th\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Oscar Ellis came to put the finishing touch to my picture.\r\n\r\nThe execution was subtle sureness.\r\n\r\nHe said that he would offer it to his beloved aunty\xe2\x80\x94Mother Schuyler, of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94begging to let it ornament the wall of my room.\r\n\r\nMy room?\r\n\r\nIt is \xe2\x80\x9cmy room\xe2\x80\x9d for a few days yet.\r\n\r\nI thought it exceedingly sweet.\r\n\r\nThe wall is duskily red. The effect would be superb.\r\n\r\nWhen I announced to him that our leave would take place on the\r\napproaching fourth, he started as if he had received a stroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, turning my uneasy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are only beginning to understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a bird of passage, as you know. I have to fly on my road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe air grew tragic.\r\n\r\nThen Oscar said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do when you tire of flying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll return to Los Angeles and induce you to marry me with my\r\nhonourable Oriental oratory. Will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe interchanged our nimble look. We laughed afterward.\r\n\r\nAfter he left Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s, I said to myself that I would not mind\r\npositively if he would kiss me. The kiss must be on my brow, however.\r\nLips are too personal.\r\n\r\nI wrote a note, beseeching him not to forget to kiss me at my farewell.\r\n\r\nThen I chewed the note.\r\n\r\nI reviled my folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n31st\xe2\x80\x94Street walking is a delight.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll mirror my face in the glass of the shop windows ambling by.\r\n\r\nI dropped a handkerchief to-day.\r\n\r\nA gentle gentleman\xe2\x80\x94man behind me should be young and good looking\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x94picked it up. His respectful \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d made me feel as if I\r\nwere living in the silver-armoured age of chivalry.\r\n\r\nShall I drop something again?\r\n\r\nI observed a variety of form in raising the skirt.\r\n\r\nOne lifted a bit of the left by her finger-tips. Another pulled up the\r\nright edge of her front. Another clinched out the centre of her back,\r\nshowing a significant fist. A corpulent one stepped, holding up both\r\nsides of her front. The miserable underskirt revealed itself in red.\r\n\r\nWhich mode is becoming to me?\r\n\r\n\r\nJan. 1st, 1900\xe2\x80\x94Is to-day the opening of another century?\r\n\r\nHappy New Year!\r\n\r\nI will send a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cShinnen omedeto\xe2\x80\x9d to Tokio.\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this a queer New Year?\r\n\r\nNo shimenawa along the fa\xc3\xa7ades with flitting gohei!\r\n\r\nNo \xe2\x80\x9cgate pine tree\xe2\x80\x9d!\r\n\r\nNo sambow for an oblation unto the gods in any room!\r\n\r\nNo rice-bread! No golden toso for the cup!\r\n\r\nI mingled with a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s girls for a \xe2\x80\x9crope-jumping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe played hide-and-seek. I offered ten cents reward to the one who\r\ndetected me. I abandoned the unprofitable job after emptying out all my\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nMiss Olive called on a bicycle.\r\n\r\nI persuaded her to let me try on her bloomers. She exchanged them for my\r\nwalking skirt which was four inches shorter.\r\n\r\nWe hurried to the garden.\r\n\r\nShe helped me on the wheel.\r\n\r\nSuch a bad Meriken girl!\r\n\r\nShe slipped her hand from it. I fell on a bush. The touchy rose thorned\r\nin my hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd\xe2\x80\x94I made a discovery.\r\n\r\nMother Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s teeth are all false.\r\n\r\nI have no chance to explore whether her hair is a wig.\r\n\r\nShe chains a big bunch of keys to her waist. Its rattle sounds\r\nhousewifely.\r\n\r\nShe forgot it, laying it on the sitting-room table.\r\n\r\nI knotted it to my waist-strap.\r\n\r\nI jiggled it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJaran, jaring, jaran, jaran!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd\xe2\x80\x94The sayonara dinner was given. Mrs. Ellis\xe2\x80\x99 folks joined us.\r\n\r\nMother Schuyler repeated every ten minutes her query, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen would I\r\nvisit them again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Oscar set his depressive look on me. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t brave enough to\r\nencounter it.\r\n\r\nI slid away from confronting him.\r\n\r\nI found him an elegant young man. He impressed me as an image of Apollo.\r\n\r\nOnly God knows when I will reprint my footsteps on the soil of Los\r\nAngeles!\r\n\r\nI felt awfully sorry in leaving such an agreeable company.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cFold your tent like the Arabs,\r\n                       And silently steal away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHow sad!\r\n\r\n\r\n4th\xe2\x80\x94Good-bye, Mr. Parrot!\r\n\r\n                                                  SAN FRANCISCO, 5th.\r\n\r\nI am again at Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco!\r\n\r\nSuch miraculous San Francisco water!\r\n\r\nI will taste bliss again in drinking the midnight water, stretching out\r\nmy arm from the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n6th\xe2\x80\x94I tied Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s hair in Nippon style.\r\n\r\nShe pleased me much by remembering the Japanese words I taught her.\r\n\r\nShe is a cute dear.\r\n\r\nThe mode had been the \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99tabaco bon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI straightened her hair with my wet hand.\r\n\r\nI added a tiny bit of crimson crape.\r\n\r\nShe looked a lovely fairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n7th\xe2\x80\x94Rainy day!\r\n\r\nThe heavily reserved weather confines me in the pose of genius.\r\n\r\nMy hair lounged down my shoulders. Disorder is the first step in being a\r\ngenius, I fancy. My eyes should be rolled up to the sky in divine\r\ntragicalness.\r\n\r\nI have had a greediness for the name of novelist.\r\n\r\nTo-day I found myself in the crisis where I must scribble or die.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that mine is a love story also, as every beginner\xe2\x80\x99s book\r\nhas been. I hope everybody will be contented with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Destiny,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nrespectable title for my fiction. Who says it is the style of name\r\nemployed one hundred years ago?\r\n\r\nThe book will be concluded with three hundred pages.\r\n\r\nNow I wonder whether a long story is in demand.\r\n\r\nChapter I, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WHEN THE MOON ROSE.\r\n\r\nThis story begins when the moon rose.\r\n\r\nIts silvery rays\xe2\x80\x94it was six P.M. of April\xe2\x80\x94fell on the Shiba park in\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nMy heroine jogged along into the park, singing a light song.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Honourable Moon, how old are you?\r\n                  Thirteen and seven, you say?\r\n                  You are young enough to marry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me explain about her a bit!\r\n\r\nHer name is O Hana San.\r\n\r\nThirteen years old. Thirteen? It is the age when the flower of girlhood\r\nstarts to bloom.\r\n\r\nBewitching Hana!\r\n\r\nDo you remember a well by the glorious cherry tree in the park? The\r\n\xe2\x80\x99rikisha men moisten their parched lips at the \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven-Sent.\xe2\x80\x9d That is\r\nits name, sir.\r\n\r\nMiss Hana looked down into the well.\r\n\r\nShe began to adjust her hair. The first worry of a girl after thirteen\r\nwould naturally be about her hair.\r\n\r\nShe gazed up to the cherry blossoms and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUtsukushii nah! Lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she found her face again in the well-mirror, thinking what a\r\ncharming O Hana San it would make with the flowers on her hair.\r\n\r\nMy worthy readers, I suppose it is the time some one must enter.\r\n\r\nHe came.\r\n\r\nHe was a little boy.\r\n\r\nI will not mention his name just yet.\r\n\r\nHe came close to her and pinched her little back. Both blushed, facing\r\neach other. They were quite strangers.\r\n\r\nThe evening zephyrs stirred the cherry blossoms. They planted themselves\r\nsilently among the falling petals, as ethereal as snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI delight to stand in the storm of petals, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d Hana inclined\r\nher head a trifle in speaking.\r\n\r\nThe woman always speaks first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see your school book!\xe2\x80\x9d again she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put it in her tiny hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks! Arigato!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bowed low. When she put the book on her shoulder, she was running\r\naway, singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Honourable Moon, how old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy stood aghast.\r\n\r\n                 *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe author of this story found O Hana San again by the same well on the\r\nnext evening.\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s book in her hand, of course.\r\n\r\nShe paced around the well, muttering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must come, because the moon rose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was not seen.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy next chapter will be \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n8th\xe2\x80\x94My precious Ada again!\r\n\r\nHow could I live without her?\r\n\r\nWe hastened to a circus.\r\n\r\nIf I were a boy, I could earn a heap of money selling \xe2\x80\x9cPea\xe2\x80\x94nuts!\r\nLemon\xe2\x80\x94ade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow those clowns did tumble!\r\n\r\nIf I could share in such fun!\r\n\r\nThe ringmaster was the handsomest man in the world, in shiny boots and\r\nheavenly hat. How splendidly his whip cracked!\r\n\r\nThe clack dashed like a burst of bamboo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be glad to be the lady on horseback? I would truly. Glance\r\nat her daring grace!\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered to Miss Ada.\r\n\r\nEven the seal performed.\r\n\r\nWe laughed till tears dropped.\r\n\r\nThe circus had twenty elephants. Think!\r\n\r\nOur Imperial Menagerie of Tokio has only one. How poor!\r\n\r\n\r\n9th\xe2\x80\x94Last night I went over to Mrs. Consul\xe2\x80\x99s to be given a lesson in\r\ncard-playing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCribbage would be the thing. Why? Because the Lambs took much pleasure\r\nin it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is poker?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGambling game!\xe2\x80\x9d she protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI delight in gambling, Mrs. Consul,\xe2\x80\x9d I proclaimed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had a wicked dream.\r\n\r\nWhat do you imagine?\r\n\r\nI ran away with a circus rider.\r\n\r\n\r\n10th\xe2\x80\x94I made the acquaintance of a Japanese woman.\r\n\r\nShe must have been passing her thirty springs. I could be accurate in my\r\nscale, being one of her sisterhood.\r\n\r\nA cigar-stand keeper in Dupont Street.\r\n\r\nHer name is O Fuji San.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wistaria brought a box of cigarettes that my uncle had ordered.\r\n\r\nThe morning is unoccupied in such a retail shop. Nobody puffs much\r\nbefore lunch. She set herself in a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate.\r\n\r\nThe chastity of a wife may be measured by her solo on her husband.\r\nWoman\xe2\x80\x99s greatest joy often lies in lamenting the faults of her teishu.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wistaria spoke of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s being ill. I was to accept any\r\nchance for squandering my feelings. I sympathised, repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cKomaru\r\nnei! How sad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said that she was going to leave the city for a week for the spring\r\nof San Jose, to take care of her infirm dear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I may lose my customers,\xe2\x80\x9d she flagged.\r\n\r\nHer husband was afflicted with rheumatism.\r\n\r\nI promised to call at her store.\r\n\r\nJaps never visit an invalid without a present.\r\n\r\nChampagne? It\xe2\x80\x99s too ostentatious a drink. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a highly rouged\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe loving-eyed claret should be chosen.\r\n\r\nI sent half a dozen bottles to Mrs. Wistaria\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nA charity woman should be dressed in black and white. I went to Dupont\r\nstreet, however, in my grey dress.\r\n\r\nHer husband struggled to entertain me. His clumsy smile appeared all the\r\ntime at the wrong cue.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name!\r\n\r\nTheir business was an absurdly small affair.\r\n\r\nThe whole stock hardly valued above one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nI thought I could conduct it rightly.\r\n\r\nI was carried away by a sudden fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you leave your store in my hands, while you are away? Say yes!\r\nNo?\xe2\x80\x9d I pressed myself upon them eagerly.\r\n\r\nThey were amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh-born lady like you? Oh, no! Doshite, doshite! Think! Do you know\r\nthis is the toughest part of the town?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Wistaria tried to make me\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her, my whole soul being absorbed in my new\r\ncaprice.\r\n\r\nI thought it remarkably romantic.\r\n\r\nI left the store to bring uncle to talk the matter over.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wistaria\xe2\x80\x99s store was neighboured by every saloon. The fuddling\r\nsounds overflowed in song:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cHello ma baby, hello ma honey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n11th\xe2\x80\x94Now he is my beloved uncle.\r\n\r\nHe assured me of his help in carrying out my freak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are fitting me for a slightly better r\xc3\xb4le, I fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nventuring to add even one or two of his good-natured giggles. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nsecretaryship of a cigar-stand is a rather more hopeful occupation than\r\ncarrying your wraps through the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything was arranged.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wistaria and her husband set off for San Jose.\r\n\r\nI am a merchant-lady.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was to put up a dignified sign with the following\r\nblack letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MORNING GLORY CIGAR STORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI borrowed a picture from Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99 parlour, and placed it by the\r\nslot machine.\r\n\r\nIt is the picture of a dear Injun sitting against a woodland fire with a\r\nrespectable pipe, whose smoke sails up to the yellow moon. What\r\nresignation! What dream! What joy! It did suit beautifully for the\r\ncigar-stand.\r\n\r\nI love to see a man smoking. The elfish smoke acts like a merry-hearted\r\nMay gossamer. When I observe a man\xe2\x80\x99s eye pursuing his smoke, I say to\r\nmyself that his soul must be stepping nearer to his ideal. The road of\r\nsmoke is the road of poesy.\r\n\r\nA noble trade is tobacco.\r\n\r\nMan\xe2\x80\x99s hermitage is situated only in smoking, I should say.\r\n\r\nI divested my uncle of his coat. I begged him to hold a bucket and a\r\npiece of cloth for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready to wash the windows, Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraitor, Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d He flashed his accusing glare.\r\n\r\nDocile old man!\r\n\r\nHe cleaned four windows of the kitchen, which was also the dining-room\r\nand the parlour.\r\n\r\nI paid him five cents for each.\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good fun to hire the chief secretary of the Nippon Mining\r\nCompany to rub windows, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I laughed.\r\n\r\nThen I forced him to buy a cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made some twenty cents out of me. Your turn is coming, my uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nI sold him a box of Lillian Russell cigars for three dollars. The real\r\nprice was two.\r\n\r\nHa, ha, ha!\r\n\r\n\r\n12th\xe2\x80\x94I invited my precious Ada to my store to dine _\xc3\xa0 la Japonaise_.\r\n\r\nOne Jap restaurant catered to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIrrashaimashi! Condescend to enter!\xe2\x80\x9d I showered my wooden-clogged\r\ngreeting over Ada.\r\n\r\nFrom \xe2\x80\x9cThe Klondyke,\xe2\x80\x9d my neighbouring saloon, a nigger song was flapping\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no money, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t come round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy Ada San!\r\n\r\nShe was about to join in it, when I brought her into my great\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n(Beg pardon, it was a paltry kitchen!)\r\n\r\nEverything was seen on the table.\r\n\r\nJapanese dinner has no strict order of courses. You are a frolicsome\r\nbutterfly among the dishes set like flowers before you. You may flit\r\nstraight to any one which catches your whim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your honourable chop-sticks!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Ada!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I manage with one stick?\xe2\x80\x9d she raised her eyelids in\r\nquestioning meekness.\r\n\r\nI bade her to split the stick in two. It was a brand new wooden one. I\r\nshowed her how to finger it.\r\n\r\nShe nibbled a bit from each dish. Every time she tasted she looked upon\r\nme with a suspicious smile.\r\n\r\nAnd how she slipped her sticks at the critical moment!\r\n\r\nThe sight amused me hugely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare I swallow raw fishes!\xe2\x80\x9d she said shrinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat delight I taste in them!\xe2\x80\x9d I slammed back at her timidity.\r\n\r\nThen I dipped a few cuts of the fishes into a porcelain soy pan for my\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nI even trampled into her fish-dish by and by.\r\n\r\nShe was literally terrified.\r\n\r\nThe feast was over. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cGo yukkuri! Honourable\r\nnot-to-be-in-a-hurry!\xe2\x80\x9d I slid away.\r\n\r\nI tied my white apron like a shop girl. I was glad that I did not forget\r\nto push a lead-pencil through my hair. I presented myself to Ada\r\ncarrying a cigarette box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you buy tobacco for your lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spread the box before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much for one packet,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with the charming arrogance of a\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\nShe was acting also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day is the memorial day of Lord Nono Sama. My sweet Oku San, allow\r\nme to make a reduction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen we laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Genjiro Yeto\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cHOW DARE I SWALLOW RAW FISHES!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n13th\xe2\x80\x94I created much noise in the Jap colony!\r\n\r\nWhy not?\r\n\r\nMany brown men pause by my store and buy, simply because they can\r\naddress a word or two to me.\r\n\r\nThey are silly, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\r\n\r\nI announce that I am tired of their faces. I have never met one\r\nprogressive-seeming Oriental since I landed. They are like a dry tree.\r\nAre their souls dying?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s why, they have no girl,\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle conclusioned.\r\n\r\nHe is so bright once in a while.\r\n\r\nWhy not make love with Meriken musume?\r\n\r\nI said I would petition the Tokio government to transplant her women.\r\n\r\nIt may ruin the Japanese girl\xe2\x80\x99s name, was my afterthought, if they ship\r\nonly the homely gang.\r\n\r\nLovely girl has no longing to sail over the ocean. She has plenty of\r\nchance to grow a flower bride at home.\r\n\r\nI pity my native boys of this city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJap! Jap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey are dashed with such exclamations from every corner.\r\n\r\nAs for me the sound of \xe2\x80\x9cJap\xe2\x80\x9d is my taste, so I spray it in my writing.\r\n\r\nI took up again my knitting work which I had commenced on the seas.\r\nNothing could be more decent to fill up my leisure in the store.\r\n\r\nMy little neck fell, as I was intent on my stocking.\r\n\r\nSome one spoke above my head: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, so!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied in businesslike reserve.\r\n\r\nI lifted my face.\r\n\r\nOya, he was Mr. Consul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you sell me a cigar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings are becoming awfully high. Mine is a distinctly dear store. Do\r\nyou know it, Mr. Consul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to pay more at the beautiful girl\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he began to titter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Arthur cigar has leaped one dollar higher since Monday, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d He mimicked a sudden alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th\xe2\x80\x94O funny drunkard!\r\n\r\nTo-day one fellow established himself before my store. He fixed his\r\namazing eyes on my face, and extended his hairy hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHel-lo, Japanese!\xe2\x80\x9d he stuttered.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to shake hands with me.\r\n\r\nI lengthened my arm, and slapped his face. I withdrew directly within,\r\nand watched him from a hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha! She got mad\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was in a tip-top state of mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me help myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pilfered one cigar from the shelf. He struck a match. He bit the\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nHe tossed himself away with ludicrous dignity, singing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPon pili, yon, pon, pon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is undeniably a tough place!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n15th\xe2\x80\x94Night has just arrived.\r\n\r\nOnly ten minutes ago a white-capped \xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x9d (I overheard people calling\r\nhim so) lighted a paper lantern labelled \xe2\x80\x9cTomales.\xe2\x80\x9d He is an\r\neating-stand keeper across the street. The loafers passed. There was\r\nsome time to watch the lazy parade. It was a blank hour of Saturday when\r\nhe could puff a whiff of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe prankish songs ceased.\r\n\r\nEven in Dupont Street I am given a page of dream.\r\n\r\nThe barkeeper of \xe2\x80\x9cRemember the Maine\xe2\x80\x9d called at my store.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember the Maine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is a name cheap as the grimness of a toothless woman.\r\n\r\nMr. Barkeeper had something to say, I imagined.\r\n\r\nI offered a stem of cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever hear a bloody cry at night?\xe2\x80\x9d he began his chapter,\r\ngathering a medley of gravity on his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScream? No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned aside. I thought he was playing a threadbare artifice of a\r\nstory-teller to tantalise my fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew I became his victim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I do scare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I never\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo begin with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, looking around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour kitchen\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be scared\xe2\x80\x94is close by a haunted room of a house on\r\nPine Street. It\xe2\x80\x99s no story. A chorus girl lived\xe2\x80\x94well, some five years\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94in that house with her step-mother. Just think! The old hen of\r\nsixty-five fell in love with her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s lover. Do you understand?\r\nShe saw one morning the young fellow kissing her daughter. She went\r\ncrazy. She shot him. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awful? The murderess leaned against the\r\nwall by your kitchen, and cried, \xe2\x80\x98I killed him!\xe2\x80\x99 I swear to you that it\r\nis all true. So, people say, a wail is heard at night from your side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMah! Mah!\xe2\x80\x9d I breathed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe retired heavily.\r\n\r\nDo I believe it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No!\xe2\x80\x9d I denied.\r\n\r\nBut I was thickly swarmed by sickening air. How could I trust me in the\r\nkitchen!\r\n\r\nI closed the store.\r\n\r\nI pasted up a piece of paper whereon was written: \xe2\x80\x9cNO BUSINESS\r\nTO-NIGHT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n16th\xe2\x80\x94I had a stomach-ache this morning. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rise.\r\n\r\nThe maid fetched me some toast and a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nI think it is very nice to eat in bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Wistaria and her husband returned from San Jose.\r\n\r\nShe lavished on me her thousand arigatos.\r\n\r\nShe said I sold sixty per cent more than on any previous week.\r\n\r\nShe wished me to condescend to accept a \xe2\x80\x9cmeagre\xe2\x80\x9d fifteen dollars as a\r\nshare of the profits.\r\n\r\nI refused it.\r\n\r\n\r\n18th\xe2\x80\x94My letter to Miss Pine Leaf (who wept with me reading Keats\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlove-letters one mournful night) is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMATSUBA SAN:\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x98Hitofude mairase soro.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98I have the honour to present a brief writing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLet me omit the shopworn form of Japanese letter-writing! Its\r\n    redundant \xe2\x80\x98honourables\xe2\x80\x99 are more cheap than honourable.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSatetoya!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cShall I begin my letter with a deep bow?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBow?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI use it occasionally before Meriken San for sport\xe2\x80\x99s sake. But\r\n    it is degenerating, in my opinion, to comic opera, like the\r\n    tortoise-shell-framed spectacles of a Chinese doctor.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNow I address you with a thousand kisses.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe kiss is the thing to begin with for up-to-date girls.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIt is useful, as a poem is useful in filling up space in\r\n    magazine-making. Woman\xe2\x80\x94even a loftily learned American\r\n    woman\xe2\x80\x94cannot be ready always with her rhetoric of expression.\r\n    The kiss comes to her relief in the crisis whenever she fails in\r\n    speech.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe kiss is everything.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jap girl is intimate with the art of crying.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cA kiss is as eloquent as a tear.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the cleverness of American woman is graded by the way\r\n    she handles it. It strikes me that every white girl is perfectly\r\n    at home with it.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cShe is awfully bright.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou wonder why she is so?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThere is one reason that I can tell you. It is because she has\r\n    a serious job to pick out her husband herself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\n    is fair to blame her growing insipid after marriage. Every one\r\n    feels tired when a weighty work is done. What would be her doom\r\n    if she were stupid? An old maid is such a sad sight, like a\r\n    broken clock, or a cradle after baby\xe2\x80\x99s death. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it dreadful\r\n    to have nothing to rejoice in but a customary tea or books?\r\n    Literary critic is one occupation left for her. Worse than\r\n    death!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am pained to state that our brown sisters are extremely\r\n    behind time.\r\n\r\n    (\xe2\x80\x9cThere are lots of exceptions, of course, like honourable you\r\n    and Miss M. G.)\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am talking of common Jap musumes.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNaturally so.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThey are like those waiting at the station for the next train.\r\n    They have only to doze and wait for the footsteps of a\r\n    matchmaker with a young man.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am grateful to the Nippon government for stimulating\r\n    education in women.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut I advise her to imprison all the matchmakers. Then the\r\n    girls will wake up at once, like one who has everything on her\r\n    back after papa\xe2\x80\x99s passing.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThat is one process to brighten them, I think.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAm I not logical?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYour last tegami questioned me whether the American lady was\r\n    charming.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAre you attentive to western sea painting?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHow does it impress you when you are close by it? Only a jumble\r\n    of paint, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? So with Meriken woman!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou should be off half a dozen steps to estimate her beautiful\r\n    captivation. You would be horrified, otherwise, by her hairy\r\n    skin.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI love her.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cShe has no headache like the Japs. (By the way, I will call\r\n    Japan, hereafter, the country of headache.) She lives in a\r\n    comedy.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNothing turns bad in Amerikey.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tragedy To Be a Woman,\xe2\x80\x99 could only be seen on a fiction thrown\r\n    in a moth-trodden second-hand store.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPolice never bother.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a deliverance!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted with my Meriken Kenbutsu.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSayonara!\r\n\r\n                   Yours,\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cMORNING GLORY\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n19th\xe2\x80\x94I forced Uncle to swear to me that he would overlook everything I\r\ndid, in consideration of my great service in darning his socks.\r\n\r\nI peeled off my shoes to begin with.\r\n\r\nI sat like a Turk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you frown like an Oni in hell?\xe2\x80\x9d I acidified my smile. I held my\r\nneedle and thread suspended in the air, while I said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a Trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t even glance at me, being engaged in writing in the other nook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, your hair ought to be curled. I will step in to-morrow morning,\r\nand turn it up before you awake. What do you think, Uncle? Oji San!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning Glory San!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe emitted a growl of satanic despotism, and soon resumed his work\r\ngracefully.\r\n\r\nI thought what a scandal if he were penning a love letter to Mrs.\r\nSchuyler, junior.\r\n\r\nI rose. I approached him with secret step. I fell on him from his massy\r\nback and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you scribbling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nErai, my honourable uncle!\r\n\r\nHe was translating Gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHistory of Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was stunned from the shame of taking him to be in such a wretched line\r\neven in fancy.\r\n\r\nI vowed to myself\xe2\x80\x94with three low bows\xe2\x80\x94to take perfect care of my noble\r\nworker.\r\n\r\nThen I gave him my sweet smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, let me fix something more! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you anything? Tear your shirt\r\nor pull off the buttons, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n20th\xe2\x80\x94Already I could suck from the agile air the flavour of spring upon\r\nthe lawn.\r\n\r\nI was roving by the rose-bushes along the street with scissors.\r\n\r\nA gentleman passed by me. How sluggish his shoes sounded! He stopped,\r\nwaving his old-scented smile, and addressed me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOhayo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive that you are Japanese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped nearer to me. I took a peep at the Bible under his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a Christian?\xe2\x80\x9d he lowered his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you read the Gospel?\xe2\x80\x9d his voice rose higher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you attend church?\xe2\x80\x9d his sound grew higher still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love to be shocked. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sustain myself against a bore. Church?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too sleepy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? I have remarked that God is with me\r\nwithout any sort of prayer, if I trace the path of righteousness. A\r\nminister is only a meddling grandmamma to my mind. If I ever build my\r\nideal city, two things shall not be tolerated. One is a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office\r\nand the other is a church. Church, sir! May I present you with one\r\nrose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI raised me to place it in his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you, Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was rescued by my uncle. How angelic his voice rang!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m much occupied this very morning,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, bowing\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\nI pushed myself within the door.\r\n\r\nPoor preacher!\r\n\r\n\r\n21st\xe2\x80\x94My answer to Oscar is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDEAR HONOURABLE MR. ELLIS:\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cLet me begin in respectable fashion!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cA Jap girl is awfully formal.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Mr. Ellis, whom you are addressing?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am an Oriental.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNippon daughters believe \xe2\x80\x98ev\xe2\x80\x99rithin\xe2\x80\x99 a gentleman mentions.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThey have been fooled enough, I should declare, in American\r\n    fiction. Oscar\xe2\x80\x94no, Mr. Ellis\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let me earn the anecdote that\r\n    I drifted to Ameriky to be toyed with! My ancestor did a\r\n    harakiri. I am pretty sure I have, then, to kill myself.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t recite again your honourable confession of love!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIt made me cry.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMy dark face with drenched eyes will degrade me to a hired\r\n    Chinese \xe2\x80\x98crying woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYour narration was dramatic.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYour cleverness is the most lamentable thing about you. Woman\r\n    used to love a bright fellow many years ago. Do you know that\r\n    the modern girl woos a stupid man?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat again such an adjective as \xe2\x80\x98heavenly\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\n    my face! No one utters the word \xe2\x80\x98heaven\xe2\x80\x99 except in swearing.\r\n    Even ministers juggle with it for a jest in church, I suppose.\r\n    My face isn\xe2\x80\x99t heavenly at all. You know it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou amused me, however, when you told how you had pillaged my\r\n    picture from Mother Schuyler\xe2\x80\x99s room to put in your own, feigning\r\n    that it needed to be retouched.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mother Schuyler!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf she knew your secret!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, I fear that such a gentleman as you does commit\r\n    forgery always. Have you no consanguinity with a convict?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cO such a wretched boy!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe saddest thing about a woman is that she is glad to fall in\r\n    love with the worthless.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDo I love you?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cGive me time to reply to the question!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is tardy with a Japanese. I was educated by\r\n    slowness; I bow one dozen times before I speak.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cO Oscar, you got to think of my side a little bit!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEvery girl claims that she has half a population as adorers in\r\n    her pocket handkerchief.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the only one young American I ever met.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf I accept your love, I am afraid one may satirise my\r\n    destitution.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll write me soon, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cYours, M. G.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94I wish I could show you how charmingly I smoke. I learned\r\n    the art recently. I tap the cigarette with my middle finger to\r\n    knock the ashes off. It is delightful to heap a hill of ashes on\r\n    the table edge. When I puff, finding no word after \xe2\x80\x98And\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\n    smoke seems to be speaking for me.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut I assure you that I smoked only before my uncle.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI was a pretty naughty girl at home, but I flatter myself that\r\n    I can easily be classed among the best in this country.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhite women behave terribly, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd\xe2\x80\x94I passed the afternoon at Mrs. Consul\xe2\x80\x99s. She gave me her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfavourite\xe2\x80\x9d discourse on Walt Whitman.\r\n\r\nI delivered to my uncle what I had learned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo newness in it. It is what dear John Burroughs or Mr. Stedman said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe overturned my castle with one blow, and lit his cigar with a\r\nvictorious air.\r\n\r\nI was enraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, eraiwa! Oriental gentleman knows everything we poor women\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI sulkily drew away to my room with Mr. Whitman\xe2\x80\x99s fat book, that I\r\nborrowed from Mrs. Consul.\r\n\r\n\r\n23rd\xe2\x80\x94A letter from my father arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Papa, please don\xe2\x80\x99t! I am tired of such a dirty conference.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nscoffed.\r\n\r\nI tore the paper into shreds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a sullen lady! What did Otto San write? Marriage proposal, I\r\nreckon!\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle intruded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa threatened me with a list of suitors. He cried, \xe2\x80\x98Chance, chance!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlike the gate-man of an ennichi show. Pray grant me for once in my life,\r\nUncle, to say: \xe2\x80\x98The marriage lottery go to the dogs!\xe2\x80\x99 How many Jap girls\r\nkill themselves from the burden of such a glued union, do you suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, \xe2\x80\x98free marriage\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very beautiful, Miss Morning Glory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Japanese, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever think I was a Meriken jin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, how did you come to know young men in a country where\r\nfamiliarity with one is regarded as a crime for a girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings all wrong in Nippon, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you were born a Jap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never go back to Japan, I think. The dictionary for Jap girls\r\ncomprises no such word as \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 But you must remember, Uncle, I have the\r\ncapital \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 in my head. I am a revolutionist,\xe2\x80\x9d I proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen I thought much of my dear Oscar.\r\n\r\n\r\n24th\xe2\x80\x94My worthy labourer upon Gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s work sat before the table for some\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nI stood behind him and dropped the fluid from a bottle on his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold! What are you doing, my little romp?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked up in a fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo harm, Uncle! It is only a remedy. Your hair is growing so thin. Do\r\nyou know it? I think it a shame to appear in Greater New York with a\r\nbald gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bought the bottle this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n25th\xe2\x80\x94A bamboo table in my room reminded me of a take bush in the\r\nneighbouring churchyard of my Tokio home.\r\n\r\n(I cannot sound Meriken jin\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity in prizing such a cheap thing.\r\nThe bamboo was painted. The cross nails glared from everywhere. I never\r\nsaw such a Jap work in Nippon.)\r\n\r\nDear take, O bamboo bush!\r\n\r\nHow I used to laugh, breaking the dreams of sparrows by wriggling the\r\nbush!\r\n\r\nI was so ungoverned.\r\n\r\nIf I could be a grammar school girl again!\r\n\r\nI secured a reader at a bookstall. My mind was made up to present myself\r\nin the Lincoln night school and mingle with the girls in \xe2\x80\x9cSEE THE BOY\r\nAND THE DOG!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat fun!\r\n\r\nI went to see the stooping principal. His tarnished frock-coat\xe2\x80\x94I fancied\r\nhe was an old bachelor, as one button was off\xe2\x80\x94was just the thing for\r\nsuch a _r\xc3\xb4le_.\r\n\r\nI seemed to him a regular nenne of thirteen.\r\n\r\nHe was heartily pleased with my greediness for learning English.\r\n\r\nPoor soul!\r\n\r\nHe ushered me into the class for which I had brought the book.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour for composition. \xe2\x80\x9cOcean,\xe2\x80\x9d the subject.\r\n\r\nWhen I was seated, the girl next me winked charmingly. She threw me a\r\nnote within a minute, to which I promptly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Glory.\xe2\x80\x9d My\r\nnote was answered \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Madge, 340 Mission Street.\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote her, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\ncall on you to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d for which she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cAs you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was placed on the dangerous verge of clapping Byron\xe2\x80\x99s poem into my\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOcean.\xe2\x80\x9d I manufactured one dozen of spelling errors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should belong to some higher class. Take this slip to the\r\nprincipal!\xe2\x80\x9d the teacher said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have an imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d She wiped her\r\nspectacles slowly.\r\n\r\nI left the room remarking, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am a Japanese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI slipped away from the school altogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne experience is plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d I declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n26th\xe2\x80\x94I went to Mission Street to call on Madge.\r\n\r\nFrom both sides of the street peeped the famous Jewish noses. The\r\nsecond-hand clothing shops parade. How droll to see those noses\r\nshrivelling like a lobster!\r\n\r\nMadge\xe2\x80\x99s father owns a despicable restaurant with only four eating\r\ntables. Mamma cooks, while she sits on the counter.\r\n\r\nWhen I appeared, she shot out, greeting me: \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully glad to see you! I have come to help you, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was ready to strip off my jacket and wind myself in her apron.\r\n\r\nHer papa was dumbfounded by my sudden action.\r\n\r\nThe outside board with the bill of fare was scraped out by this\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s rain. It looked as miserable as an Italian vegetable wagon\r\nunder the rain.\r\n\r\nMy first work was to rewrite it.\r\n\r\nI saw a Jew at a neighbouring door striving with one about the value of\r\npants. A shoemaker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpan, pan\xe2\x80\x9d hammered on my head from the opposite\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMission Street is the street of horse-dung.\r\n\r\nWhen my job was over, an honourable Mr. Wagon Driver leaped in, bidding\r\nme serve some soup.\r\n\r\nI ran into the kitchen to fetch it.\r\n\r\nI spilled it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, honey!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in patronising aloofness, and pierced\r\nmy face with his gummy red eyes.\r\n\r\nO Kowaya! Shocking!\r\n\r\nI put one five-dollar piece of gold on Madge\xe2\x80\x99s palm when I left her.\r\n\r\nBecause her shoes were heelless.\r\n\r\nPity the musume!\r\n\r\n\r\n27th\xe2\x80\x94I bought one book, being captivated by its title. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nKnighthood was in Flower\xe2\x80\x9d beautifully chivalrous?\r\n\r\nI have remarked that every Imperial cruiser anchors at an isle close by\r\nLoo Choo, just on account of the enticement in the name \xe2\x80\x9cCome and See.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found in my trunk an introduction to Miss Rose by my professor friend\r\nof Tokio \xe2\x80\x99versity.\r\n\r\nMiss Rose?\r\n\r\nMy imagination started to move like a watch. I fancied she should be\r\nnineteen, since she was a Miss. No Rose girl can be homely.\r\n\r\nI went to see her.\r\n\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\nShe was a lady like a beer-barrel. Her finger-nails were black.\r\n\r\nI left her like a miner stepping out of a gold mountain with empty\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI wonder why the mayor didn\xe2\x80\x99t object to letting an ugly woman be crowned\r\nwith a pretty name.\r\n\r\nFifty-years-old Miss Rose!\r\n\r\nNow I fear to read Mr. Major\xe2\x80\x99s book.\r\n\r\n\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94The following is my letter to Mr. Oscar:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOSCAR SAN! ELLIS SAN!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI never liked your profession, simply because it is too\r\n    beautiful.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you cannot transfer to some other business.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI have been ever so much fascinated with odd sorts of manual\r\n    work. If I were a gentleman, I would very likely pursue the\r\n    calling of grave-digger or sea-diver.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday I passed by some labourers breaking massive stones.\r\n    They lifted their hammers (O Oscar, look at their muscles!) and\r\n    knocked them down to the sound of \xe2\x80\x98Sara bagun!\xe2\x80\x99 They jerked the\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98sara bagun,\xe2\x80\x99 Oscar. Does it mean \xe2\x80\x98ready?\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99 Century\r\n    dictionary must be imperfect, since it does not contain such a\r\n    word. Am I mis-spelling?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I marry one of those!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe will return home awfully tired. He will naturally doze after\r\n    dinner. When his smoking pipe has slipped from his lips and\r\n    burned my best tablecloth, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that I will be\r\n    mad?... I startled him, pulling his hair ever so hard. Now you\r\n    must think that he grew mad also. He seized my arm, and beat me.\r\n    O Oscar, he beat me surely!... Then he will repent his conduct,\r\n    and kneel by my side, begging my forgiveness. He will say, \xe2\x80\x98My\r\n    dear sweet wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how interesting it is to be beaten by a husband?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI well-nigh fixed my mind never to affiance with a man too\r\n    genteel to hit me.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWoman is a revolting little bit of thing.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf you say \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I am quite ready to slam my \xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOscar San!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that you are too amiable.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you have to do for your next missive is to collect every\r\n    kind of dreadful adjectives from your dictionary, and throw them\r\n    in.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what to do when I get angry, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEllis San!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou are too handsome.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am fond of a comely face as anybody else.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut I fancy often how it would be if I fell in love with a\r\n    deformity.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPeople would laugh at me doubtless. But how dramatic it would\r\n    be when I proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Because I love him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a romantic phrase that is!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you deform yourself?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSayonara,\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cWith a thousand bows,\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cM.

I mentioned \xe2\x80\x98Olive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man is jealous always.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you got to counterfeit your sister\xe2\x80\x99s penmanship for your envelope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n29th\xe2\x80\x94I drank the last drop of my coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOji San, when shall we go to New York?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, pillowing my face on my\r\nhands on the breakfast table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as spring begins to flicker in the East, my little woman! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsnow and snow there at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love snow, Uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld gentleman can\xe2\x80\x99t bear tyrannical cold, Morning Glory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you notice how tired I am of Frisco? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you tired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94frankly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you then contrive some novel diversion to pass a month?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a fancy, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may not strike you as romantic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am known to one poet who dreams and erects a stone wall on the\r\nhillside. He is unlike another. His garden and cottage are open to\r\neverybody. I ever incline to loaf in an irregular puff of odour from his\r\nacacia trees. If you lean towards a poetical life, I have no hesitation\r\nin seeing him to make an arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Uncle, it\xe2\x80\x99s romantic! Is he married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause a poet is not one woman\xe2\x80\x99s property, but universal. My ideal\r\npoet is melancholy. Fat poet is ridiculous. Happy poet isn\xe2\x80\x99t of the\r\nhighest order. Tennyson? I wish his life had been more hard up. I\r\nsuppose your friend-poet won\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I sleep all day. Is he particular\r\nabout the dinner time? Does he look up to the stars every night? Does he\r\nwash his shirt once in a while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I asked respectably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the sight from there beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful! The only place where you can breathe the air of divinity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Uncle. We will settle there, and hasten to become poets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad idea, I say, to start again with your honourable\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lotos Eaters!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Paradise Lost\xe2\x80\x99 shall be my next subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf nobody publishes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will present it solemnly to our Empress. She is a poetess, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle went to see Mr. Poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n30th\xe2\x80\x94Uncle said that the poet said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome, sir. The cottage\r\nfor your young lady lies by one willow tree. The waters, the air, the\r\ngrand view, are God\xe2\x80\x99s. It costs a wee bit of money to provide the best\r\ncoffee. I tell you that my claret is superb. You shall be my guest as\r\nlong as you please. Present my love to Miss Morning Glory! Everything\r\nwill be ready when you come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he adorable?\xe2\x80\x9d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\nI stirred my trunk, and sifted out the things needful for my adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n31st\xe2\x80\x94To-morrow!\r\n\r\n                                                  THE HEIGHTS, Feb. 1st\r\n\r\nLet me recline heart-to-heart on the breast of Mother Nature! Let me\r\nretreat to a hillside not far from the city, yet verily near to God! Let\r\nme go to my poet abode!\r\n\r\nWe abandoned the Fruitvale car at the hill-foot.\r\n\r\nMy uncle picked out our destination from the speckles in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe breeze (how heavenly is a country breeze!) enticed my soul\xe2\x80\x94a Jap\r\ngirl also is provided with some soul\xe2\x80\x94into \xe2\x80\x9cFar-Beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel myself another girl, Uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a poet already. The poet without poem is greater, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe climbed the hill slowly. Every step enlarged the spectacle.\r\n\r\nWhen we attained to one wildly well-kept garden, the whole bay of the\r\nGolden Gate stretched before us. A thousand villages knelt humbly like\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nI saw a tiny gate with the sign:\r\n\r\n                            \xe2\x80\x9cFruit Grower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old gentleman appeared from a cottage, singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cAh, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,\r\n                Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoet!\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle whispered.\r\n\r\nLet me now examine him!\r\n\r\nWhat lengthy hair he wore!\r\n\r\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t annoy me, however, because he stamped himself on my mind as if\r\nhe were an ancient statue. I imagined him a type of medi\xc3\xa6val squire. I\r\nthought of him truly as one metamorphosed from the frontispiece of a\r\nwholly forgotten volume in a cobwebbed recess of a library.\r\n\r\nHis courteous voice was simply dignified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNature never hurries. God commands you every happiness and all repose.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s your little home, my gentle lady! I am at your service any time.\r\nI hope you will find it comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set me at the \xe2\x80\x9cWillow Cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slipped gracefully away.\r\n\r\nThere was some time before I heard his \xe2\x80\x9ckotsu kotsu\xe2\x80\x9d on my door.\r\n\r\nI opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreeting from the host!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Heine offered me a tuft of brisk roses.\r\n\r\nHeine was the poet\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nHow loving!\r\n\r\nI buried myself in the thought of straying to a fairy isle, and being\r\naccepted romantically by the dwellers.\r\n\r\nI suspected that I was dreaming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArcadia!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, when the poet announced that supper would be\r\nprepared within half an hour.\r\n\r\nI spied him through the window, gathering the loppings of trees and\r\nleaves. He made a camp-fire. Its soft smoke surged into the sky. Oh,\r\nsmell it!\r\n\r\nHow fascinating is the Poet\xe2\x80\x99s life!\r\n\r\nI ran out, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, make me useful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd\xe2\x80\x94Dream and reality are not marked here by different badges. They\r\nwaltz round. Dear poet home!\r\n\r\nWas it in my dream that I heard the tinkle of bells?\r\n\r\nI thought something was going on.\r\n\r\nI parted from the bed. I pushed out my face from the window.\r\n\r\nLook at the procession of cows!\r\n\r\nI have read much of them, but I admit that it was my first occasion to\r\nadmire them. I am a trivial Jap, only acquainted with cherry blossoms\r\nand lanterns. How I wished to knot the bells round my waist, and whisk\r\ndown the path by the violets!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLover\xe2\x80\x99s lane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt should be the title for that path, I thought, if I were Mr. Poet.\r\n\r\nI finished my toilet. I leaped out upon the grasses smiling up to the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nI congratulated myself on my new life.\r\n\r\nThen I found my uncle sitting by the camp-fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOhayo!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, filling the seat on another side.\r\n\r\nI remember one Japanese essay, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Poetry of a Tea Kettle.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed! The\r\nkettle was a singer. Its melody was far-reaching. It was like a harp of\r\npine leaves fingered by the zephyr.\r\n\r\nI faced up, and saw my poet moving down from the lily pond. Two frogs in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrogs?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will complete our table. How did you sleep, my lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to taste a greater joy in Nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to hear it, my dear. My life is like the life of a bird. I\r\nawake when the sun rises. I lay me in the bed at the bird\xe2\x80\x99s dipping into\r\nits nest. God made the night for keeping quiet. That is better than\r\nprayer itself. I light neither lamp nor candle. I presume that every\r\nyoung lady has certain secret work at night. Let me offer you a few\r\ncandles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe ate breakfast from the table by the fire.\r\n\r\nFrogs supplied a special dish.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch it, thinking of the songs of frogs that I had heard all\r\nthe night long.\r\n\r\nSuch a song! It was the muddy-booted song of the countryside. No\r\nvaluable quality in it, of course. But I should say that they tried the\r\nbest they could.\r\n\r\nPoor Messrs. Frog!\r\n\r\nI fancied the leg in my dish was that of one who volunteered to sing my\r\nlullaby.\r\n\r\nI almost cried in grief.\r\n\r\nThe poet was ready to wash the dishes. I was quick to snatch his job. My\r\nuncle wiped them.\r\n\r\nStupid uncle!\r\n\r\nHe broke two dishes.\r\n\r\nI collected the bones of the frogs, and buried them. On the stone above\r\nthem I wrote with a pencil:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomb of Unknown Singers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when we were done with our breakfast?\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did yesterday was to stop the tick-tack of my watch,\r\nand hide it in the lowest drawer.\r\n\r\nThe watch is a nuisance since I am thrown in THE GARDEN OF ETERNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd\xe2\x80\x94I searched for a pen and ink in my Willow Cottage.\r\n\r\nNothing like those.\r\n\r\nFoxy Poet!\r\n\r\nHe hid them from view, I fancied, in the opinion that playing with them\r\nfor a girl is more jeopardous than swallowing needles.\r\n\r\nI say that letter-writing\xe2\x80\x94particularly a decent love letter, if there is\r\none\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t half so grave a crime as rhyming.\r\n\r\nI was spraying some water on a rose by the gate, when I caught sight of\r\na white quill by my shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will serve me perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI had not one thing with any tooth except my comb. (Comb? Luckily I have\r\nnot lost it Ara, ma, my hairpins! Five of them vanished from my head\r\nwhile I was springing amid the rocks. By and by the stems of acacia\r\nleaves shall be used in their places. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know this is quite a\r\nremote spot from civilisation?) A kitchen knife shaped my quill as a\r\npen.\r\n\r\nNow only ink!\r\n\r\nI begged Uncle to run down three miles to fetch one bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n4th\xe2\x80\x94We went to \xe2\x80\x9cbreathe the song of the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe forest laces the poet\xe2\x80\x99s canyon.\r\n\r\n(By the way, poet\xe2\x80\x99s ground spreads over one hundred and fifty acres.\r\nDoes he pay taxes?)\r\n\r\nWe climbed the \xe2\x80\x9cRoad to the Milky Way.\xe2\x80\x9d I beseech your forgiveness, it\r\nwas merely the name I wished for the path to the poet\xe2\x80\x99s hilltop. I felt\r\nas if I were hurrying to the \xe2\x80\x9cSermon on the Mount.\xe2\x80\x9d You would hardly\r\nbelieve Morning Glory if she said that sublimity vibrated in her soul,\r\nbecause she was just a little Oriental. How grand! We faced toward the\r\nGate of the Pacific Ocean. We were still. Why? Because we were thinking\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nWe traversed the poet\xe2\x80\x99s graveyard.\r\n\r\nHow romantic to put up a tombstone while living!\r\n\r\nHow romantic to lie in the ecstasy of a marvellous view! We could be\r\nnearer the stars here.\r\n\r\nWe stepped down to the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe poet said solemnly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady and gentleman, this is a holy place where you can pray heartily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle started to drone Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s hymn:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cThe groves were God\xe2\x80\x99s first temples.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever read Thanatopsis, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Heine asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a noble piece. So many thousand Asiatics converted every year to\r\nthe English alphabet. Wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d he soliloquised.\r\n\r\nWe seated ourselves by a brook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a lesson in Nature! We endeavour to transcribe, but fail,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsighed, looking on the trees.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to me questioning:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear the silent song of the forest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence! Silence!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nWe walked among the trees. We came back to the same hilltop, when the\r\nlarge red ball of the sun sank heavily from the Gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBye-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d I shook my handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe playful breeze carried it away. It glimmered like a silvery\r\ninspiration. Who knows how far it sailed?\r\n\r\nI thought a huge statue of the Muse bidding sayonara to the dying sun\r\nwould be the fitting ornamentation for these Heights. Countless numbers\r\nof people would look upon it from the valley. It would be a salvation,\r\nif they could bind themselves with Poesy by its noble figure. There was\r\nno question it would be more effective than a thousand pages of poem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no coin to build it,\xe2\x80\x9d the poet said, in dear openness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me present it by and by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen? It must be after I get married to a rich philanthropist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe laughed.\r\n\r\nWe rolled down the hill in the purple fragrance of evening. The evening\r\nwas sweet like a legend.\r\n\r\n\r\n5th\xe2\x80\x94I wrote a letter to the artist:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMY SWEET OSCAR:\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cYou will love no more your Morning Glory, I am certain,\r\n    when you are informed how she looks nowadays.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cShe inclines against a willow trunk by her cottage. Were you\r\n    ever acquainted with the great repose of a poetess? Her eyes\r\n    flash in divine sarcasm. She will shoot them down to the mortal\r\n    domain (she lives on the mountain), while she murmurs in\r\n    tragical accents: \xe2\x80\x98I pity you, ant-mortals!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she shocking?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOscar, I have withdrawn to the Heights, and am prying into the\r\n    Incomprehensible of Nature with Mr. Heine.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe is unique.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI take it upon me to say that he is a great poet. Because, in\r\n    the first place, he never asked me yet, \xe2\x80\x98Do poems pay in Japan?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a trying work for an old man like him to pose as a\r\n    poet all the time.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPoet is a sensitive creation. He fancies, I think, the whole\r\n    world is staring at him. Poor Poet! He keeps up, and tries to be\r\n    picturesque as he can.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am grieved to state, however, that his picturesqueness\r\n    frequently drops into silliness.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe absurd thing is that even my uncle takes a part in his\r\n    farce.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWe had no meat to bite yesterday.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe poet had no shot left for his gun.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he plan, do you imagine?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe went up the hill, shouldering his pick. My uncle retainered\r\n    him with a spade.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We will soon bring back a squirrel which we will dig out, Miss\r\n    Morning Glory,\xe2\x80\x99 the poet said.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCould you ever suppose, Oscar, that any animal except an\r\n    invalid (an animal who has four feet at that, instead of two\r\n    like my venerable gentlemen) could permit itself to be so slow\r\n    like them?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI laughed till my side ached.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cFunny old men!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEvery sort of sweat fell from their brows when they dragged\r\n    their fatigued feet home not accompanied by even one inch of any\r\n    animal tail.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have never heard yet, Mr. Poet, of a squirrel turned to\r\n    turnip,\xe2\x80\x99 I gibed.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI dread old age, because it makes woman inquisitive, and man\r\n    silly. Inquisitiveness is tasteless like wax, while silliness is\r\n    helpless, like a fish on the sand.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you are silly already, when you say that you sat up late\r\n    looking at my picture.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSat up late?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do if your mamma thinks you can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep from hard\r\n    drink when you yawn continually at the table?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it again!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cStep to your bed at half-past six as I do!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that my picture approved your act?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI guess it shrugged its shoulders from contempt, the delicious\r\n    moment of blushing being passed.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf my picture is so precious, I advise you to alter it to\r\n    ashes. You will take two spoonfuls of the ashes every morning. I\r\n    am sure, then, your soul will be saved.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cO my darling, I love you!\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cI am your\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cLITTLE JAP GIRL\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94This letter was written by my duck-quill. My new\r\n    invention, you know.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMy handwriting is clumsy enough, I suppose, to sell as high as\r\n    any ancient author\xe2\x80\x99s autograph.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSayonara!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n6th\xe2\x80\x94O poppy, beloved harbinger of California spring!\r\n\r\nI \xe2\x80\x9chung on the honourable eyes\xe2\x80\x9d of a poppy by my door. Its quaking cup\r\nburnt in love (for a meadow-lark perhaps).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me feed you, my new friend!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and brought out a cupful of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nI moistened it.\r\n\r\nA golden flake of the sun-ray came down to it. It smiled, daintily\r\nthanking me for my humble treat.\r\n\r\nI stared at it, slowly fabricating a fable of its love affair, when the\r\nbreeze sent me a dreamy song.\r\n\r\nThe song was old-fashioned, like the afternoon snore of a water-wheel.\r\n\r\nI plunged into the song, not knowing who was the singer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAra, ara, Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s song!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe is the aged mother of our poet. She is within the rim of ninety. I\r\nsuspected her of having discovered the \xe2\x80\x9cElixir for Preserving Eternal\r\nGirlhood.\xe2\x80\x9d You cannot help esteeming her a philosopher when you are told\r\nthat she has visited San Francisco only twice in ten years. I have no\r\nbit of doubt that she would die if you were to rob her of the sight of\r\nher flower garden and one stout scrap-book about her son\xe2\x80\x99s poems. They\r\nwork a miracle. What a mystery is human life!\r\n\r\nI say that I\xe2\x80\x99m touched by superstition.\r\n\r\nI have read of a villainous fox who masquerades in the shape of an old\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nMy wretched fantasy about Mrs. Heine passed, when I heard that no fox\r\nresided in the hill.\r\n\r\nShe is such a dear grandma.\r\n\r\nShe has no hostile grimace against age. She welcomes it. Her wrinkles\r\nare all her beauty. Natural ripening in age is but another form of\r\ngirlhood.\r\n\r\nShe is happy as a sparrow.\r\n\r\n(Sparrow never forgets, it is said in Nippon, to dance in its hundredth\r\nyear.)\r\n\r\nShe hoes round her garden. Her vanity is to make her table rich with her\r\nown potatoes and roses.\r\n\r\nShe lives alone by herself in a cottage some hundred steps from mine.\r\n\r\nDid you ever taste her cooking?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mrs. Heine!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe showed herself, extending her large hands. They were damp. I thought\r\nshe was employing herself in washing.\r\n\r\nIs there any sweeter occupation than service to an old lady?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me help you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI carried out a bucket to a spring in the backyard.\r\n\r\nI brimmed it with the waters. It was so weighty. A naughty stone bounced\r\nunder my heel. I was thrown down like a toy.\r\n\r\nAlas!\r\n\r\nMy bucket was upset over my skirt.\r\n\r\nI had made myself a specimen of misery. \xe2\x80\x9cO grandma, it\xe2\x80\x99s raining awfully\r\noutside!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\r\n7th\xe2\x80\x94To-day I was the _chef_, while my uncle was second cook.\r\n\r\nI placed a heroic iron pot over the camp-fire I dropped a lump of beef\r\nin, and afterward the mass of potatoes, carrots, and onions. Mr. Poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirections were that they should boil for two hours.\r\n\r\nMr. Heine intruded, saying that he would like to season them himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLongfellow, Lowell\xe2\x80\x94they all loved high seasoning as I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsnatching a pepper-box from my hand.\r\n\r\nHe kept tapping the bottom of the box, when the cover fell into the pot.\r\n\r\nOya!\r\n\r\nThe red pepper garmented the whole thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Mr. Poet! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind your own business? You are butler\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d I spoke in rough sweetness, and drove him away.\r\n\r\nHe began to place a linen cloth on the table, while I dipped up all the\r\npepper. He picked up one dozen pebbles to weight the tablecloth. The\r\nfirst thing he put on the table was his claret bottle. How could he lose\r\nit from sight! When he said that everything was in place, he had\r\nforgotten the knives and forks. Dear old poet!\r\n\r\nWe sat at the table under the wild rose bushes.\r\n\r\nMr. Heine read aloud the following menu:\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cPERFUME OF OMAR\xe2\x80\x99S ROSE\r\n                         WATER OF JORDAN RIVER\r\n                         MOTHER LOVE BROTH\r\n                         MEAT OF WISDOM\r\n                         POTATOES OF SIMPLICITY\r\n                         PASSION CARROT\r\n                         ONION OF WIT\r\n                         DREAM COFFEE.\r\n\r\n                              DESSERT\r\n\r\n              TYPICAL TOKIO SMILE OF MISS MORNING GLORY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy grandmamma was our guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, you talk too much always. Remember, this is a sacred service.\r\nSilence helps your digestion. Eat slowly, think something higher, and be\r\ncontent!\xe2\x80\x9d Poet said.\r\n\r\nWe smelled the \xe2\x80\x9cPerfume of Omar\xe2\x80\x99s Rose,\xe2\x80\x9d and wet our lips with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWater of Jordan River.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe broth was served.\r\n\r\nEverybody choked with its pungent fire.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Heine!\r\n\r\nShe was showering her tear-beans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is perfectly seasoned. Send up your bowl again, ladies and\r\ngentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Poet\xe2\x80\x99s performance was beautifully buffoonish.\r\n\r\nWe finished our meat and vegetables.\r\n\r\nI smiled lightly, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready for the Tokio smile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust ten minutes yet, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d The poet smoothed such a lengthy gray\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nI winked to Grandma. We looked upon him slyly.\r\n\r\n\r\n8th\xe2\x80\x94The poet was hoeing in his vegetable garden.\r\n\r\nHis attire was theatrical.\r\n\r\nHis red crape sash laxly surrounding his trousers lacked, I am sorry to\r\nsay, a large Japanese tobacco bag. The cap with gay ribbons was like one\r\nof Li Hung Chang\xe2\x80\x99s. His back carried a bearskin, inside of which some\r\nslovenly yellow silk flapped down.\r\n\r\nHow tall he was!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, don\xe2\x80\x99t dig over there, Mr. Heine, because I buried my poem\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat poem, my lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poem to be read at the unveiling of my statue of the Muse on your\r\nmountain top, which may occur possibly within five years. The opening\r\nlines sound thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x98Victor of Life and Song,\r\n                        O Muse of golden grace!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s great! Why did you bury it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you bury your poems? The best poems are those not published. The\r\nvery best are those not written. Dante Gabriel Rosetti buried his \xe2\x80\x98House\r\nof Life,\xe2\x80\x99 because they were not for a gaping millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s wife, but\r\nonly for his own little wife. But his greatness was ruined when he dug\r\nthem up and sold them. Poor poet! What all the poets ought to do, I\r\nthink, is to bury their poems in a potato garden. What a shame even the\r\npoets have to eat once in a while! They should wait till the potatoes\r\ngrow, and then sell them in a vegetable stand, calling \xe2\x80\x98Poetical\r\nPotatoes!\xe2\x80\x99 Do you sell your poems, Mr. Heine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you making your living with your fruits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never sell them, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give them to needy persons. But I was obliged, last year, to hang up\r\na sign, \xe2\x80\x98No Fruit Lover is Wanted.\xe2\x80\x99 I told an Oakland minister to come\r\nup and eat _some_ plums. He brought his wife and children, even his\r\ngrand-mother. They shouldered away every bit of fruit from half a dozen\r\ntrees. Next day so many people trampled in with an introduction from the\r\nminister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a minister! I see no use to have the sign, \xe2\x80\x98Fruit Grower,\xe2\x80\x99 if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear lady, God will be merciful to let me use it in place of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poem Manufacturer!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy uncle announced that tea was boiled.\r\n\r\nWe left the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n9th\xe2\x80\x94The fogs held possession of our world, like the darkness of night.\r\n\r\nWhere did they invade from?\r\n\r\nPacific Ocean?\r\n\r\nOur hillside cottages looked like a tottering ship having no hope for\r\nany haven.\r\n\r\nTremendous sight!\r\n\r\nI planted me on the hilltop. My mind merged in Japanese mythology. I\r\nfelt as if I were the first goddess, Izanagi, standing on the \xe2\x80\x9cFloating\r\nBridge of Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d before the creation.\r\n\r\nThe divine ghastliness bit my little soul.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand against it. I crept down like a mouse.\r\n\r\nThe poet said he was preparing a lecture. Its title was \xe2\x80\x9cNot in Books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe in his bed\xe2\x80\x94there he passes every forenoon\xe2\x80\x94was reciting his song.\r\n\r\nThe words leapt like a leaping sword:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cSail on! Sail! Sail on! And on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI threw a bunch of roses over to his bed as an admirer does to a star.\r\n\r\nThen I clapped my hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPan, pan! Pan, pan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n10th\xe2\x80\x94I went up the hill to gather mushrooms and watercresses.\r\n\r\nI filled a huge basket with them.\r\n\r\nI carried it down on my shoulder in Chinese laundry style. I paused\r\nevery twenty steps.\r\n\r\nI slipped within the gate of Mrs. Heine\xe2\x80\x99s back garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMush\xe2\x80\x94rooms! Water\xe2\x80\x94cresses!\xe2\x80\x9d I called boisterously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl!\xe2\x80\x9d Grandma smiled out from her door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hands off, please! They are things for sale. To-day they are\r\nuncommonly cheap. Will you buy them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you charge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo thousand words of the story about your illustrious son\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a funny vendor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me something about him! I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to leave you the whole\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I narrate to you how he started to write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see your things first!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, tugging the basket nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t watercresses, but baby weeds. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconsider they are legitimate mushrooms, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned upon me with compassionate objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOya, oya, you don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, no story, Grandma?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nlooked up meekly.\r\n\r\n\r\n11th\xe2\x80\x94We had sipped our supper tea some time ago.\r\n\r\nA band from the bay sent up irregularly the melody of the love and\r\nprowess of dear mariners.\r\n\r\nThe white moon rose.\r\n\r\nI sat alone on my front step, and watched tenderly by the poppy.\r\n\r\nMy darling Miss Poppy shook herself prettily, as if she uttered a sweet\r\nword out of her heart. I imagined every sort of speech that may come\r\nfrom such a tiny bit of flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSodah, she said that she loved me!\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured.\r\n\r\nI made a little letter.\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cMISS POPPY:\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cI love you too.\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cYours,\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cMORNING GLORY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rolled it to a ball. I dropt it in her cup.\r\n\r\nThe moon turned gold. The evening odour filled the air.\r\n\r\nLook!\r\n\r\nShe was folding her cup, pressing my missive to her breast. There was no\r\nquestion that she understood.\r\n\r\nDearest friend!\r\n\r\nWas it silly that I cried?\r\n\r\n\r\n12th\xe2\x80\x94The poet left the Heights to exchange his MS. for a gallon of\r\nwhiskey.\r\n\r\nHe carried a demijohn, which was as apt to him as a baby to a woman.\r\n\r\nI volunteered to clean his holy grotto.\r\n\r\nThe little cottage brought me a thought of one Jap sage who lived by\r\nchoice in a ten-foot square mountain hut. The venerable Mr. Chomei Kamo\r\nwrote his immortal \xe2\x80\x9cTen-Foot Square Record.\xe2\x80\x9d A bureau, a bed, and one\r\neasy chair\xe2\x80\x94everything in the poet\xe2\x80\x99s abode inspires repose\xe2\x80\x94occupy every\r\nbit of space in Mr. Heine\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. The wooden roof is sound enough\r\nagainst a storm. A fountain is close by his door. Whenever you desire,\r\nyou may turn its screw and hear the soft melody of rain.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s plenty. What else do you covet?\r\n\r\nThe closetlessness of his cottage is a symbol of his secretlessness. How\r\nenviable is an open-hearted gentleman! Woman can never tarry a day in a\r\nhouse without a closet.\r\n\r\nHe never closes his door through the year.\r\n\r\nA piece of wire is added to his entrance at night. He would say that\r\nthat will keep out the tread of a dog and a newspaper reporter.\r\n\r\nNot even one book.\r\n\r\nHe would read the history written on the brow of a star, he will say if\r\nI ask him why.\r\n\r\nEvery side was patched by pictures and a medley of paper clippings. Is\r\nthere anything sweeter to muse upon than personal knick-nacks?\r\n\r\nO such a dust!\r\n\r\nI swept it.\r\n\r\nBut I thought philosophically afterward, why should people be so fussy\r\nwith the dust, when things are but another form of dust. What a far-away\r\nsmell the dust had! What an ancient colour!\r\n\r\nI observed on the wall an odd coat and boots that dear old Santa Claus\r\nmight have lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKlondyke costume!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI undressed myself, and tried them on.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ready to put on a fur cap, Mrs. Heine wandered down, calling\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning Glory! Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI trembled in deadly fear.\r\n\r\nI hid me promptly by the bureau, under the bed. I shut my eyes, praying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNamu Daijingu, don\xe2\x80\x99t let her find me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n13th\xe2\x80\x94Last midnight (O voicelessness of the hillside yonaka!) I woke up.\r\nThe moon peeped into my sitting-room. She laid a square looking-glass on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nI abandoned my bed, and sat by the glass.\r\n\r\nI spread on it the letter from my sweetheart.\r\n\r\nI read it over and over, till I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read any more, the moon being\r\nkidnapped by the cloud-highwayman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Oscar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cried in the darkness.\r\n\r\nI could not slumber all the night, on account of my thought of him.\r\n\r\nA letter was written to him to-day.\r\n\r\nNature and love! I am now living with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th\xe2\x80\x94I elaborated a nosegay.\r\n\r\nThe poet and uncle dignified themselves in frock-coats.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the coffin was slow.\r\n\r\nMr. Poet had proffered his own graveyard to let an unknown poet lodge\r\nthere. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it because you want some one to greet you when you die?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid in laughter.\r\n\r\nI seated myself by a creek.\r\n\r\nI entered involuntarily into the riddle of Life and Death.\r\n\r\nThe water under my feet rolled down, positively not knowing why nor\r\nwhence. The wind passed, \xe2\x80\x9cwilly-nilly blowing.\xe2\x80\x9d I wondered whither it\r\nwent. Mr. Omar is unquestionably a true poet. The petals of a rose\r\nbefore me fell.\r\n\r\nI murmured:\r\n\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x9cEach Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say;\r\n              Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI was crying in sadness when the coffin arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. Heine and my uncle lifted it by either edge. The neighbouring\r\nfarmers and two sardonically cool gentlemen from the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s aided\r\nthem. The jaw-fallen papa of the dead carried all the posies.\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Morning Glory (who is the belle of Tokio) shouldered a bench\r\nfor the purpose of sustaining the coffin when they were tired.\r\n\r\nThe hill is precipitous.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen stopped numberless times, before they stationed themselves\r\non the top.\r\n\r\nThe grave was hollowed behind Mr. Poet\xe2\x80\x99s monument. They sank the coffin.\r\n\r\nWhat a tremor of silence sharpened the air! I was shaking.\r\n\r\nThe poor papa read a chapter from the Bible. He described his loving\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s life, in doleful honourableness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a thousand flowers in Spring,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the poet spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhose repute\r\nis not extensively spoken, like that of the rose or violet. Some of them\r\nare not given even a name. They spend their smile and odour into the\r\nbreeze, and die without any repining. They are content, because they are\r\ntrue to God. So a poet\xe2\x80\x99s life should be. What is celebrity? Keats was\r\ntold of his beautiful graveyard, and he said: \xe2\x80\x98I have already seemed to\r\nfeel the flowers growing over me.\xe2\x80\x99 If this poet, whom we now bury, had\r\nbeen told of this hill, he might have said: \xe2\x80\x98I see already the\r\nbutterflies beaming over my head.\xe2\x80\x99 Spring is coming. The poppies and\r\nbuttercups shall dress the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA church-bell chimed from the valley.\r\n\r\nWe left the buried to his solitude.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy uncle and I sat under an acacia tree, silent for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Morning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, exhibiting a silver piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any story about that dollar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe father of the dead paid me for carrying the coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, did you accept it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a funny uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have spoiled all your nobility for only one dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI upturned my face, afterward, appealing in gleeful tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Uncle, you ought to give me half of it. Fifty cents! I carried the\r\nbench, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n15th\xe2\x80\x94I arose at the first whistling of a meadow-lark.\r\n\r\nHearken to its hailing morning voice!\r\n\r\nO simple bird!\r\n\r\nIts so various moods are expressed only in its eternally changeless\r\nsyllables. What a magical song!\r\n\r\nHow bungling seemed our human vocabularies!\r\n\r\nI trod the garden in bare feet.\r\n\r\nNaked feet, sir!\r\n\r\nThe delicious chilliness of the ground animated me rapturously. Do you\r\nbelieve me if I confess that I knelt and kissed it? I said that I would\r\nnot mind burying my nude body for a few hours. Mother earth is so sweet.\r\n\r\nI ran up the hill, humming an Oriental ditty.\r\n\r\nThe air was relishable, like an ice-cream on a summer midnight.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful sun was rising.\r\n\r\nI clapped my palms thrice, reverently bowing.\r\n\r\nAm I a sun-worshipper?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nI cleansed my feet in the water of the creek when I returned from the\r\nhill. I sat me on a rock, extending my bare feet in the sunlight. I\r\nthought that towel-wiping was too much of a modernism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle! O Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d I called.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Miss Morning Glory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poet jutted out from a bamboo bush by the wooden bridge over the\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch charming feet!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI instantly lowered my skirt, blushing.\r\n\r\nHe was carrying a spade and hoe. He said that he had been planting\r\nflowers about the grave of our friend, ever since four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cTo make\r\nit beautiful is high poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d he philosophised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish with Uncle, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me have the honour of fetching them for you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in amiably\r\ndignified docility.\r\n\r\n\r\n16th\xe2\x80\x94The poet gave me five feet square, behind the Willow Cottage, for\r\nmy potato garden.\r\n\r\nI sticked a stick at each corner. I encircled it with my crape sash.\r\n\r\nThe note hanging on it read, \xe2\x80\x9cGraveyard of Morning Glory\xe2\x80\x99s Poem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hired uncle for ten cents, to clear off every weed.\r\n\r\nI raked.\r\n\r\nI set the seeds.\r\n\r\nI got a suspicious coat and pants from a nook in the unrespectable barn.\r\nIt was fortunate that the horse\xe2\x80\x94who may also be a poet, he is so\r\nphilosophically thin,\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t shout, \xe2\x80\x9cHoa, clothes-thief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put them on the limbs of an acacia tree.\r\n\r\nI planted it on my graveyard to scare away wild intruders.\r\n\r\nIt is holy ground.\r\n\r\nI wondered when the potatoes would grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94Squirrel!\r\n\r\nWhat admirable eyes!\r\n\r\nHe projected his head from a hole by my window. He withdrew it a bit,\r\nand bent it to one side, as if he were solving a question or two.\r\n\r\nThen his eyes stabbed my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no questionable character, Mr. Squirrel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHe hid himself altogether.\r\n\r\nI amassed some crusts of bread by his hole, and watched humbly for his\r\nhonourable presence.\r\n\r\nHe did not peep out at all.\r\n\r\nThe bread was not a worthy invitation. I varied it with a fragment of\r\nham.\r\n\r\nMr. Squirrel wasn\xe2\x80\x99t void-stomached.\r\n\r\nI thought he needed something to read. I tore a poem from the wall. I\r\nleft it by his respectable cavern.\r\n\r\nLo!\r\n\r\nHis head sprouted out to pull it in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha, even the squirrel is a poetry devotee, in this hill!\xe2\x80\x9d I said in\r\nhumourous mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n18th\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMOST BELOVED:\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cMamma was flogged with a bamboo rod some hundred times when she\r\nwas a girl, her exchanging of a word with a boy over the fence being\r\ndeemed an obscenity. My papa spent his lonely days in a room with\r\nConfucious till one night a middleman left him with my mamma as with a\r\ndolly. I do believe they never wrote any love letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would they say, I wonder, if they knew that their daughter had\r\ntaken to Love-Letter Writing as a profession in Amerikey?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t censure my penury in writing, knowing that I am a musume\r\nfrom such a source.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOscar, are your windows clean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery window of my Willow Cottage was washed yesterday. Is there\r\nanything more happy to see (your beautiful eyes excepted) than a shiny\r\nwindow? I pressed my cheek to the window mirthfully, when Mr. Poet tried\r\nto pinch it from the outside. My dearest, if he had been my very Mr.\r\nEllis!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made a discovery while I was trimming about the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess what it was?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Love-Letter Writer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Gift from Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, trusting it would help me in my\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lit a candle last night. I hid it behind the cover of such a huge\r\nbible which I had borrowed for the purpose. I was heedful of two old men\r\nwho might disturb me, mistaking the light for a sign that something had\r\nhappened. Poor Mrs. Heine almost cried, she was so pleased to think that\r\nI loved the Bible. Do I love it? Oho, ho, ho\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBakabakashi, how sad!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole bunch of letters wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fit for my taste at all, at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that I used up two candles that were all we had in this hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, my darling, my letter has to be woven from my truest heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, my sweet lord! How are you? Have you breakfasted? Did you\r\neat a beefsteak? I dislike a hearty morning eater. My ideal man\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be given more than a cup of coffee and one trembling leaf of\r\nbacon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Poet kills a frog every morning. He says that his fancy springs\r\nlike a pond singer when he tastes it. I should say that his idea bounds\r\ntoo far in his case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you eat frog?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beseech you not to incline toward it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I do if your thought ran off from me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFailure of my life! Love is the whole business of woman, you know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any shirt to mend?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been fixing the poet\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, express it to me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you ask such a pleasure of any other girl, it would be a fatal\r\nmistake for you. Remember, Oscar, that the Japanese girl is a mightily\r\njealous thing!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sweetheart, I dreamed a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were a dragonfly, while I was a butterfly. It is needless to say\r\nthat we loved. One spring day we floated down along the canyon from a\r\nmountain a thousand miles afar. Our path was suddenly barred by a dense\r\nbush. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t attain to the Garden of Life without adventuring in\r\nit. So, then, you stole in from one place, I from another. Alas! We got\r\nparted forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that a terrible indication?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any spell to turn it good? I am awfully agitated by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, kiss!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me, my dear!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to ascertain your love in it.\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cMORNING GLORY\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n19th\xe2\x80\x94A little \xe2\x80\x9cchui chui\xe2\x80\x9d was building a nest under the roof, by my\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nDear jovial toiler!\r\n\r\nI must help him in some way.\r\n\r\nI unravelled one of my stockings, hoping it might be serviceable in\r\nbettering his home.\r\n\r\nI stood me on a chair, raising up my arms with my gift.\r\n\r\nThe poor sparrow was scared. He cast a gray \xe2\x80\x9chonourableness\xe2\x80\x9d on my hand.\r\n\r\nO naughty \xe2\x80\x9cchui chui!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe winged away, twittering, \xe2\x80\x9cchui, chui, chui!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n20th\xe2\x80\x94The squirrel by my window shows a great fancy for me. He honoured\r\nme three times already this morning. He bore a somewhat scholarly air. A\r\nretired professor, I reckon.\r\n\r\nIs he regular with his diary?\r\n\r\nPossibly he is idle with a pen, like any other professor.\r\n\r\nLet me scribble for him to-day!\r\n\r\nMy one bottle of ink has some time to dry up yet.\r\n\r\nI will name it \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cave Journal.\xe2\x80\x9d I will leave it to the Professor for\r\na souvenir upon my sayonara to this hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n\r\nWhere are my spectacles?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   B\r\n\r\nUpon my soul, I believe that some mischief is raging. I can never trust\r\neven the poet abode. Who stole my two-cent stamp?\r\n\r\nGod bless you, my precious daughter at Sierra Nevada!\r\n\r\nBy and by I will erect my private telegraph between us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   C\r\n\r\nThe idea of an idiotic spider tying his net across my front gate!\r\n\r\nHow ever could he be so ambitious as even to incline to arrest me!\r\n\r\nHe may very likely be a detective. A railroad brigand is hiding in these\r\nHeights, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThe world is running worse every day.\r\n\r\nHow shocking!\r\n\r\nIt was a fundamental error of God, to create that adventuress Eve. The\r\noffspring of a crow can\xe2\x80\x99t be other than a crow.\r\n\r\nOur squirrel history is not blotted by any criminal. I feel a bit\r\nconceited in speaking about it. How can I help it?\r\n\r\nThe trouble with God is that he was awfully vain to express his own\r\nability by so many useless things.\r\n\r\nRifle, for instance.\r\n\r\nMy poor wife!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   D\r\n\r\nTo-day is the anniversary of my beloved. She was shot by one two-legged\r\nbarbarian.\r\n\r\nI appealed to the police. American police are rotten, through and\r\nthrough. The murderer bribed them, I fancy.\r\n\r\nI found my wife, but she was only a skin.\r\n\r\nHow often did I tell her that she was risking too much in sporting\r\naround! But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind me, insisting that sight-seeing was a better\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nI carried her skin into my home.\r\n\r\nI cleansed it, and altered its form a trifle, because it was a lady\xe2\x80\x99s. I\r\nam still keeping it for church-wear.\r\n\r\nI feel dreadful, thinking of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   E\r\n\r\nA butterfly passed by my cavern, a hundred times.\r\n\r\nEach time she threw me a vulgar laugh.\r\n\r\nHer face was thickly powdered in yellow. Does she think herself\r\ncharming? I should say that I would prefer a girl in tights from a\r\nsaloon-stage to her indecency.\r\n\r\nSuch a flirt!\r\n\r\nI suppose that she wanted me to marry her.\r\n\r\nNo!\r\n\r\nAm I not old enough to avoid running into such foolishness?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   F\r\n\r\nRainy day!\r\n\r\nI sat in a memorial corner of my cave, with an unfinished novel of my\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nI do judge she had flashes of genius. She was so deep, like the sky. I\r\nnever suspected that she could gracefully have beaten George Eliot, if\r\nshe had only survived.\r\n\r\nPoor girl!\r\n\r\nOne tenderly loved by God passes away young.\r\n\r\nI have fallen into the habit of crying unmanfully nowadays.\r\n\r\nI cannot help it, can I?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   G\r\n\r\nOne thing I must furnish is a bathroom.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is the first rule of heaven, I am told.\r\n\r\nI went to the lily pond to take a gracious bath.\r\n\r\nO such water gamins! Dirty-handed frogs!\r\n\r\nHow could I dip me in the turbid water?\r\n\r\nThe frogs ought to go to a reformatory school. They have no culture,\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   H\r\n\r\nCamera hunters are thick as fogs.\r\n\r\nTo-day I came near being a victim.\r\n\r\nNo, sir!\r\n\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t permit my picture to be seen with those of cheap matinee idols.\r\nI must keep some dignity.\r\n\r\nAmericans are too commercial altogether. The pictures of our race are in\r\ndemand, I imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nBeautiful moon, last night!\r\n\r\nI filled my stomach with the divine water from a creek.\r\n\r\nMy face waved in the water. I flattered myself that I was a pretty\r\nhandsome gentleman.\r\n\r\nI sang an ancient Chinese song:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cCome \xe2\x80\x99long, to-morrow moon,\r\n                       Carrying a harp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   J\r\n\r\nStop your empty noise, meadow-larks!\r\n\r\nSilence is the first study of this hill and the last, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\r\n\r\nI am absorbed in my grave work, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Secret of the World.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   K\r\n\r\nMy neighbouring Jap girl is rather attractive, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nI heard a few scratches of her native bubbling.\r\n\r\nThe pagan speech is not so bad as I thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   L\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing I cannot endure, it is ignorance.\r\n\r\nWhat is the state of your roses, old boy?\r\n\r\nThe poet Heine is utterly alien to rose culture. Shall I order \xe2\x80\x9cHow to\r\nRaise Roses\xe2\x80\x9d from a London publisher?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   M\r\n\r\nI went up the hill to pray to God. The higher the nearer.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back, my honourable vestibule was blocked, I found, by the\r\ndirt. The poet was ditching close by my residence.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t blame his conduct, however, because no one could see my home.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t hang out a sign like a quack doctor.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that I would strike into his cottage, and snatch the\r\nbest poems from his drawer, and sell them with my name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must secure the international copyright,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare it, my impulse being thwarted.\r\n\r\nI am no wicked reporter, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\n\r\nI hid me in his historical iron pot all day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   N\r\n\r\nHeine was posting around the following card:\r\n\r\n                             _No Shooting._\r\n\r\nI venture to say that he is the only one civilised Two-Legged in the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   O\r\n\r\nWhere is my napkin?\r\n\r\nChinese laundry isn\xe2\x80\x99t punctual in delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   P\r\n\r\nI think I must learn how to swear for a pastime.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Q\r\n\r\nMy fellow brother Mr. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 was shot this morning.\r\n\r\nThe paper says that there is a possibility of war between Russia and\r\nJapan. A preacher prophesies the disappearance of the universe.\r\n\r\nEverything is precarious in the extreme.\r\n\r\nI will not poke around outside during the day. I will loaf in the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norchard under the breezy moonlight.\r\n\r\nPoetical existence is just enough. I will withdraw me to the sanctuary\r\nof the Muses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   R\r\n\r\nHeaven be with my soul! Amen!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   S\r\n\r\nGood-bye, my dear old world!\r\n\r\n\r\n21st\xe2\x80\x94A Chinaman passed with a weighty load of washing on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend, stop a minute! Take a glass with me before you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poet rolled out with a claret bottle.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a Chinee in love? Did you ever see one smile?\r\n\r\nMr. Charley smiled a serene smile of the Flower Kingdom pattern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the Empress Dowager!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Poet said. Both raised their wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe load is too heavy for you. You are killing yourself. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nto see it. My friend, obey me! Let me help you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave till I come\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poet, hurried for his questionable buggy and horse. He cracked his\r\nwhip\xe2\x80\x94he never whips the horse, but he carries it for fashion\xe2\x80\x99s sake, as\r\nhe remarks\xe2\x80\x94when Mr. Charley protested, \xe2\x80\x9cMe oll-righ, you savvy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman was dumbfounded, for the poet was unknown to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Heine pushed him in.\r\n\r\nWhen he leaped up, he noticed his horse in tender tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a goody-goody! His act never parts from poetry, however,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI was simply dying for an opportunity to explode my good heart, when I\r\ninvited one tramp to my Willow Cottage.\r\n\r\nI fed him with one dozen eggs.\r\n\r\nI emptied out all my change for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you feel cold, lying outdoors?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you need an overcoat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Tramp left me with an overcoat in his hand, looking like a\r\nproud Mayor of Tokio, my uncle was coming from Mrs. Heine\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, you do want to be good to a poor man, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You have made\r\nyourself a great philanthropist with your overcoat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presented it to a tramp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning Glory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Uncle! I will buy a swell coat in New York. You have some\r\nmore, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cost me forty yens at \xe2\x80\x99Hama. You really are a foolish girl, Asagao!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Asagao is my humble name in Japanese.)\r\n\r\nThen I kissed his hand most pathetically\xe2\x80\x94in fun for my part, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd\xe2\x80\x94My superstitious Mamma!\r\n\r\nShe mailed me an o mikuji from the holy box of the Akiwa god.\r\n\r\nThe number written on the slip was fifty-one. The divine will read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith in the Well-God will result fortunately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMamma bade me make my prayer long (not mixing it with any laughter\r\nwhatever).\r\n\r\nI wondered whether there was any well around here.\r\n\r\nI explored. I came across one (such a doubtful well) by an apple tree.\r\n\r\nI hastened to my cottage to cut a paper flag.\r\n\r\nThe poet gave me one cup of claret for the Well-God.\r\n\r\nI sat by the well.\r\n\r\nWhat did I pray?\r\n\r\nI pried into the well for the fin of a fish. Well without a funa fish\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t holy to a Jap mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n23rd\xe2\x80\x94Uncle left the Heights for Frisco.\r\n\r\nI have encountered somewhere one picture, \xe2\x80\x9cStolen Kiss,\xe2\x80\x9d symbolising\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\nI dare say the sweetest thing in the world is to steal into a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s room and over-turn his things.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman smell is provocative.\r\n\r\nMy uncle?\r\n\r\nI can only say that he is more desirable than an old woman. Old woman is\r\nsad as a dry persimmon.\r\n\r\nI stole into his room.\r\n\r\nGod will overlook my petty crime\xe2\x80\x94how lovely to be scratched by guilt!\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nconsideration of the fact that a Jap girl never profanes.\r\n\r\nI turned his pillow. Pillow is a fascination for me ever since I have\r\nread of a poet who hid his diary under it.\r\n\r\nLook at the book, \xe2\x80\x9cA Random Note!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was working to beat me with his journal, I derided.\r\n\r\nI sat on his bed, opening it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow original!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nUncle, you are a cynic, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nLet me pick a few pieces from his pen!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately! Japanese are accustomed from babyhood to depend on\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s back. The hereditary fashion of nursing the baby on the back\r\nhas thoroughly taught them dependence. Independence is only a coat of\r\narms to distinguish man from the beasts\xe2\x80\x94that is all. I urge that\r\nEmerson\xe2\x80\x99s essays be adopted in the Nippon schools. His \xe2\x80\x98Self-reliance\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshould be the first of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost unhappily! I have observed the Japanese fad in America for years,\r\nand it has not yet reached its culmination. Each month the books on\r\nJapan are placed before the public. It is verily sad even to cut their\r\nedges. (The practical Americans prove themselves unpractical in leaving\r\nthe leaves of books uncut.) I say that our Japan is entitled to regard\r\nfor worthier things than geisha girls or a fashion in bowing. We should\r\ndecline your love, Americans, if it is rooted merely in your fancy for\r\nour paper lanterns. I have frequently come to conclude that Americans\r\nare eminently the freakish nation. I feel not only occasionally that\r\nthey lack the reasoning power. I do not assume the phenomena of the\r\nyellow journals as my proof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year or two ago, one Japanese theatrical troup roamed. They are not\r\ncatalogued at home as actors. They chose to skip on the stage, simply\r\nbecause a bit more money is in it than in the calling of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98lantern-carrying for politicians.\xe2\x80\x99 Any wild animal can skip. I am now\r\nconfronted with the question whether American generosity is not without\r\nsense. They piled up their money for them. Even the first-class critics\r\nstruggled to find out something from such poor art. I am bound to be\r\nthankful, however, for the Americans saved these poor players from\r\nbankruptcy in Japan. It reminds me of a story. Our Nippon government\r\nmany years ago appointed a certain loafing sailor as an English\r\ninstructor, giving him a monthly pay of three hundred dollars. Sailor\r\nwith an anchor-tatoo on his hand! Three hundred dollars are no small\r\ncoin in Japan. Our sailor professor said, I am told, that he had not\r\nheard of any Milton. Ignorance can easily be a philanthropist, if it can\r\nbe anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJapanese love Nature? They do. But how sad to glance at Japanese\r\ngarden! It is painful to notice the dwarf trees. Japs never permit one\r\nthing to grow naturally. Country of deformity! America, most natural,\r\nmost manly nation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n24th\xe2\x80\x94My uncle didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back yesterday. Mr. Poet condescended to the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nI am alone.\r\n\r\nI spent the entire forenoon with Grandma, peeling potatoes, strewing\r\nsweet pea seeds on the ground.\r\n\r\nI ascended the hill with the root of a white rose\xe2\x80\x94believing in the\r\nNippon idea that blossoms for the dead should be white\xe2\x80\x94and set it by the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nThen I stole into the canyon.\r\n\r\nI amassed the dead leaves of redwood by the brook for a camp-fire.\r\n\r\nThe smoke rose like a soul unto heaven.\r\n\r\nI watched its beautiful confusion.\r\n\r\nWhen I left, a snake obstructed my path, flashing its needle of a\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nSnake, one of my greatest foes! (The others being cheese and\r\nmathematics.)\r\n\r\nI turned pale.\r\n\r\nBut I bravely faced it, hoping that it would speak a word or two, as one\r\ndid to Eve. I placed my eyes on it, though in fear. Perhaps it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as\r\nintelligent as the one in the garden of Eden. Maybe it thought it\r\nnothing but a waste of time to address a Jap poorly stored in English.\r\nIt crept away.\r\n\r\nI ran down the hill.\r\n\r\nA storm of laughter struck me from within when I came to my Willow\r\nCottage. I examined it from the window. Half a dozen young ladies were\r\nbiting pie. (Pie! Rustic pastry I ever so hate!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPicnic!\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured.\r\n\r\nMy blood gushed up. I was on the verge of denouncing their irruption.\r\nThe cottage belongs to any one, I said in my afterthought, as it does to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI slipped away.\r\n\r\nI found myself in the plum orchard with a hoe.\r\n\r\nI began to root the weeds. I waited silently for their departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n25th\xe2\x80\x94The spring hills were coquetting like a tea-house maiden, singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cThe air is lovely like wine;\r\n                      Come, Lord! Come, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curtain for the spring comedy has not yet risen.\r\n\r\nAlready the picnic band invades.\r\n\r\nTo-day I will make myself mistress of a hillside coffee-house.\r\n\r\nThe poet\xe2\x80\x94the eternally sweet poet\xe2\x80\x94hastened to borrow a tent from a\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nHe set it on the greenest spot of grass before my cottage. I must excuse\r\nhis conceit, he entreated, in showing his skill by baking a cake for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept my hundred arigatos!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed demonstratively.\r\n\r\nI pasted a paper\xe2\x80\x94such a bashful brown piece from a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s table\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe sign of\r\n\r\n                            \xe2\x80\x9cBISHOPS\xe2\x80\x99 REST.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poet tacked \xe2\x80\x9cTen Cents for Coffee and Cake\xe2\x80\x9d on the fence by the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nThe cups (what a shame that their arms were all off) were rinsed, when\r\nhe showed me an imperial poundcake, declaring it his own manufacture.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock I was fully prepared for an honorable guest.\r\n\r\nThe coffee on the oil-stove was surging, when two parties went by, not\r\nspending even one look at my sign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimes are awfully hard, I think. People have not luxury enough to spare\r\neven a dime,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured sadly.\r\n\r\nI said that I would have no business, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the next party my\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nI appeared before the tent, when a few girls\xe2\x80\x94who were born for laughing,\r\nbut not for thinking\xe2\x80\x94came close by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you rest and taste the cake that the poet made, ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nice,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, rolling into the tent.\r\n\r\nI served them with coffee and cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this surely the poet\xe2\x80\x99s cake? It looks like baker\xe2\x80\x99s cake,\xe2\x80\x9d one girl\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Poet assured me it was of his own making,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied in cool\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nAfter they left, I scrutinised the cake. Oya! A little bakery mark was\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty liar!\xe2\x80\x9d I grumbled.\r\n\r\nAbrupt clouds clouded the sun. The winds scolded bitterly. I decided\r\nthere was no business remaining.\r\n\r\nI called Mr. Heine and uncle into the Bishops\xe2\x80\x99 Rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cake was fine, Mr. Poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, Miss Morning Glory. I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty good cook, you see. I\r\ncooked once in a Sierra camp for fifty miners. I was paid twenty dollars\r\na week. Alas! It was the biggest money I ever earned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Mr. Heine, the bakery sent a bill for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI placed before him a slip that I had prepared for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis open laughter was as from a simple Faun.\r\n\r\nI noticed, afterward, a black mass heaped in a ditch. The whole\r\nsituation grew plain to me. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bake, but only burn, in the\r\noven, and had despatched his neighbour for the cake.\r\n\r\nDear Poet!\r\n\r\n\r\n26th\xe2\x80\x94We pressed the poet to receive some money as just a sign of our\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Heine despised our thought.\r\n\r\nHonourable gentleman!\r\n\r\nI found a tin box. I put the money in\xe2\x80\x94ask me not how much!\r\n\r\nI dug a hole by the willow tree beside the lily pond, and buried the\r\nmoney box. I tumbled a stone over it to mark it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write him about it from New York. See, Uncle! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it unique?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nUncle wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enthusiastic in approving my idea. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t check me,\r\nhowever, as the money was mine.\r\n\r\nHe said he would order an elegant vase from Tokio.\r\n\r\n\r\n27th\xe2\x80\x94I intended to keep a sweet fashion of old Japan in presenting a\r\npoem at my sayonara.\r\n\r\nWe will take leave to-morrow.\r\n\r\nO gracious graceful poet abode!\r\n\r\nMy farewell poem in seventeen syllable form is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \xe2\x80\x9cSayonara no\r\n                         Ureiya nokore\r\n                         Mizu no neni!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                         \xe2\x80\x9cRemain, oh, remain,\r\n                         My grief of sayonara,\r\n                         There in water sound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Heine kissed me.\r\n\r\nDear old Grandma!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what this is, Miss Morning Glory?\xe2\x80\x9d the poet said, plucking\r\na leaf from a tree by his door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFig-leaf! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MY SAYONARA POEM IN JAPANESE AUTOGRAPH.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my child! It is a fig-leaf. Do you know the fig tree? It is the\r\nshyest tree in the world. Classical tree, indeed! It has no blossom,\r\nbeing so modest of display, but it has the fruits. Remember, my young\r\nlady, its teaching of \xe2\x80\x98Modesty! Modesty!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSayonara, Mr. Poet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI ran into the Willow Cottage to get a cupful of water. I watered my\r\nfriend Miss Poppy with love.\r\n\r\nBye-bye, little girl!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  SAN FRANCISCO, March\r\n1st\r\n\r\nCivilisation again!\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to buy a cake of the best soap.\r\n\r\nBecause my hands had perfected their transformation into worthless\r\nleather while I dwelt on the hill.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of soap did I use, do you suppose?\r\n\r\nLaundry soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd\xe2\x80\x94Delightful Ada!\r\n\r\nWe drove to the Cliff House, Ada to laugh at the stupid song of the\r\nseals, I to say my adieu.\r\n\r\nGood-bye, Pacific Ocean!\r\n\r\nWe cried in hugging.\r\n\r\nWe shall not see each other for some time,\xe2\x80\x94maybe never again!\r\n\r\nAda!\r\n\r\nO Ada San!\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd\xe2\x80\x94This afternoon!\r\n\r\nEastward, ho, ho!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  OVERLAND TRAIN, March\r\n4th\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Butterfly\xe2\x80\x9d lay by me, appealing to be read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, iya, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never open! I erred in buying you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nI dislike that \xe2\x80\x9cMadame.\xe2\x80\x9d It sounds indecent ever since the \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLoti spoiled it with his \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Chrysanth\xc3\xa8me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe honourable author of \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Butterfly\xe2\x80\x9d is Mr. Wrong. (Do you know\r\nthat Japanese have no boundary between L and R?) Undoubtedly, he is\r\nqualified to be a Wrong.\r\n\r\nAuthorship is nothing at all, nowadays, since authors are thick as\r\nChinese laundries.\r\n\r\nWell, still, it can be honourable, if it is honourable.\r\n\r\nJapanese fiction penned by the tojin!\r\n\r\nIt is a completely sad affair. I wonder why the author (God bless him)\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t fit himself for brooming the streets instead of scrawling.\r\n\r\nThe characters in his book\xe2\x80\x94I am grateful I see no lady writer of\r\nJapanese novels yet\xe2\x80\x94remind me of the \xe2\x80\x9cdevils of mixture\xe2\x80\x9d swarming in\r\nYokohama or Kobe, whose Jap mother was a professional \xe2\x80\x9chell.\xe2\x80\x9d It is\r\nlamentable to set the verdict on them that they have inherited the art\r\nof framing lies from their mamma.\r\n\r\nDo I vex you, gentleman, when I say that your Japanese type could only\r\nbe an unprincipled half-caste?\r\n\r\nYour Nippon character eyed in blue, and hairy-skinned always. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nabsurd when it puts a \xe2\x80\x99Merican shoe on one foot and a wooden clog on the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nAnd if you insist on registering it as a Jap, I shall merely laugh\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\nOne heroine I have read of placed a light summer haori over her heavily\r\npadded mid-winter clothes.\r\n\r\nYour Oriental novel, let me be courageous enough to say, is a farce at\r\nits best.\r\n\r\nOh, just wait, my sweet Americans! A genuine one will soon be offered to\r\nyou by Morning Glory.\r\n\r\nI stepped out to the platform, and threw out \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Butterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor \xe2\x80\x9cMadame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI trust in the mountain lions of high Nevada to cherish her lovingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n5th\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMatsuba Sama, the following letter creeps \xe2\x80\x98under your\r\n    honourable table.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHow is yourself?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine that the breeze fills your bower with the odour of\r\n    ume flowers. I am definite in saying that the Japanese ume is of\r\n    different origin from the California plum tree, which has no\r\n    expression in divine fragrance as I am told. I see your indolent\r\n    face in the air, awaiting poetical inspiration on your bamboo\r\n    piazza where the ume petals are beautifully blotched.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThere are several months yet till we shall quarrel face-to-face\r\n    over the superiority of English or Oriental literature.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Pine Leaf, I\xe2\x80\x94or rather we\xe2\x80\x94have said farewell to Frisco.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIt was sad that I never saw any battleship (excepting one\r\n    shamefaced gunboat) in the bay of the Golden Gate. A bay without\r\n    battleship is like a door without a lock.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCan you fancy any Japanese city without soldiers?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican soldier?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say that I have met no soldier in my four months\r\n    at the Pacific.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI presume that the practical Meriken jins can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see\r\n    such a useless ornamentation. Yes! Soldiers are degenerating, in\r\n    my opinion, to the rank of a fireplace on a hot summer day. How\r\n    stimulating, however, was the sound of the fearless hoofs of a\r\n    cavalier! When the sabres of a regiment flashed in the sunlight,\r\n    I could never keep from fluttering my paper handkerchief.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not excite myself in such a joy in Amerikey.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI made the acquaintance of one colonel at Mrs. Willis\xe2\x80\x99. He is a\r\n    jolly business man. Just think of a colonel plus merchant! Is it\r\n    possible? He changes his white shirt every morning, and shines\r\n    his shoes twice a day. I should say that he will carry a sheet\r\n    and opera hat, and leave his gun behind, whenever he is summoned\r\n    to a battle-field. Possibly he has hidden his colonelship in his\r\n    trunk.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI found afterward that every old gentleman is a colonel or\r\n    judge.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEverything in California is made for just a woman.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia gentleman isn\xe2\x80\x99t privileged to raise one question\r\n    against a lady. He is provided with all sorts of exclamations to\r\n    please the woman. If he should ever miss one dinner with his\r\n    wife, he would be divorced in court on the morrow.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cUncle says that the Eastern gents are not so devoted to the\r\n    lady.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIf it be true!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAm I now entering the city of Man?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHow sad!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any experience of writing by the car-window?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI feel a strange delight in scanning my romantically tremulous\r\n    handwriting. A certain famous Jap penman takes wine before he\r\n    begins, for the sake of putting his mind in a fine frenzy, as\r\n    you know. The shaking of the car produces in me the same effect.\r\n    Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this letter great enough to be honoured on your tokonama?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCan you ever imagine how vast Amerikey is?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday our car ran all day long, over the mountains and\r\n    prairies, seeing only a few huts.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cO such a snowstorm in the evening!\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe train rushed like a maddened dragon. It was verily an\r\n    astonishingly ghastly spectacle as any human thought could ever\r\n    picture. I thrilled with a feeling of tragic ecstasy, which is\r\n    the highest emotion.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCan you recollect that you and I once stood under the darkest\r\n    rains without an umbrella, and laughed hysterically?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI love shocking emotion.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cSince I was touched by the continental air, I measure my lungs\r\n    dilating two inches bigger. How sorry I shall be for you when I\r\n    return! You are so tiny! I expect myself to be five inches\r\n    higher within the next few months.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAmerikey is the country where everything grows, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cEven the stars look a deal larger than in Japan.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLooking back at the Rocky Mountains,\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cYours,\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cASAGAO\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n6th\xe2\x80\x94The rocking of the train makes us babies in the cradle.\r\n\r\nThe car is a modern opium resort, where we sleep and sleep.\r\n\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if we all turned into nodding Rip Van Winkles.\r\n\r\nTo-day I had a sleeping contest with uncle.\r\n\r\nI was defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  CHICAGO, 7th\r\n\r\nChicago water is a perfect horror.\r\n\r\nGomenyo! That\xe2\x80\x99s no way to begin, is it?\r\n\r\nI never waver in saying that California girls borrow their fairness from\r\ntheir water.\r\n\r\nThere is no question in my mind why the Chicago women\xe2\x80\x94certain hundreds I\r\nsaw, if you please\xe2\x80\x94are barren in their complexion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Uncle, how many days have we to tarry here?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, within an hour\r\nafter we had set foot in this city.\r\n\r\nI grieve over my contact with such a city. It is no place for a lady.\r\n(Is here any lady?) It is just the place for a man.\r\n\r\nNo show marked \xe2\x80\x9cOnly for a Man\xe2\x80\x9d is respectable, I dare say.\r\n\r\nAre Chicago men \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey are not sensitive about their hats in the hotel elevator. The\r\nlaundry work isn\xe2\x80\x99t superb, I judge, as not every one\xe2\x80\x99s shirt is snowy as\r\na San Franciscan\xe2\x80\x99s. I cannot blame their black finger-nails, as they\r\nlive in smoke.\r\n\r\nEven the Frisco smoke hindered my breath at my opening moment in\r\nAmerikey. I should have died, if it had been Chicago.\r\n\r\nBodily cleanliness is the first chapter in the whitening of the soul.\r\nHow many mortals are there here with a clear soul?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChicago is Mr. Nobody without the smoke, like Japan without a fan. The\r\nprosperity of a modern city is measured by the bulk of its smoke,\r\nMorning Glory. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of their using a cheap coal. Health\r\nhas to be guarded,\xe2\x80\x9d my uncle said.\r\n\r\nA driver carried us from the station as if we were pigs.\r\n\r\nMind you, this is Chicago illustrious for its hams.\r\n\r\nI barred my ears with my hands in the carriage. The thunderous noise\r\nmenaced me so.\r\n\r\nDo roses blossom well in the turbulent air?\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Chicago has no poet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCook County fosters three thousand poets, one paper says, my young\r\nwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle said in laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I had established myself in the hotel, I inscribed\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nlongest apologetical ojigi to Mr. Shelley\xe2\x80\x94as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cHell is a city much like Chicago,\r\n                    A populous and a smoky city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n8th\xe2\x80\x94How sad I felt, not to be greeted by even one star from my hotel\r\nwindow last night!\r\n\r\nI was disgusted with the poor taste of the coffee. Such a first-class\r\nhotel! Coffee and maxim, I have said, should be of the very best.\r\nCommonplace words with the golden heading of Maxim would be as cheap as\r\na negress with white powder. I would choose even a bread pudding rather\r\nthan a suspicious cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nUncle failed to secure a box of cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe most delicate shape for smoking is the slender stalk of a cigarette.\r\nThe cigar ever so much impresses me as barbarous. Chicagoans might say\r\nit was the only manly smoke.\r\n\r\nTruly!\r\n\r\nChicago is the City of Man (whatever that means).\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m glad that the young gentlemen with genteel canes under their arms\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t open any cigar-stand conference here. Such an abomination in\r\nFrisco!\r\n\r\nNo drones, whatever.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was going out sight-seeing with me in a silk hat.\r\n\r\nI objected to it.\r\n\r\nPlug hat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit informal Chicago.\r\n\r\nHe changed his frock-coat for a sack-coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Uncle, you look more like a Chicago gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a plain sack-coat city.\r\n\r\nHe was fussing with a handkerchief. I said, laughing: \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\r\nUncle! I am sure the men don\xe2\x80\x99t carry it here, since the women never\r\ncarry a purse in their hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it awful that one (even a stranger) ought to know everything in\r\nChicago? A slight question to the street people would be condemned as a\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nEven the policeman shows no chivalry.\r\n\r\nI was sorry that the colour of his suit was bitterly faded.\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Chicago rich enough to furnish a new one?\r\n\r\nI suppose many dogs must be hanging around here, because the policeman\r\narms himself with a piece of wood for chasing them off.\r\n\r\nI should like to know if there is any blacker house than the City Hall.\r\n\r\nIt will be a matter of a short time before the Chicago River turns to\r\nink.\r\n\r\nThen we went to observe the Lake of Michigan from Lincoln Park.\r\n\r\nI scoffed at my absurdity in being ready with the first line for my poem\r\non the lake. If you knew that \xe2\x80\x9cO minstrel of Heaven and Truth!\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nbeginning, you would laugh surely. The lake wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a huge singer like\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Genjiro Yeto\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cUNCLE. PLEASE COUNT HOW MANY STORIES IN THAT BUILDING.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, please, count how many stories in that building!\xe2\x80\x9d I begged.\r\n\r\nChicago structures \xe2\x80\x9ccrush my little liver\xe2\x80\x9d completely. Did I ever dream\r\nthat I would eye such pillars of the sky in my life?\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to my hotel, I declared that I would not open my trunk,\r\nbecause my everyday dress was good enough for Chicago.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that the gentlemen are so homely.\r\n\r\n\r\n9th\xe2\x80\x94How dear is the green crispy paper money.\r\n\r\nWhat a historical look!\r\n\r\nIt made me feel as if I were at home.\r\n\r\nI hated ever so much the gold coin in California. Its threateningly\r\nmercantile aspect made me shudder as at a speculator of Kakigara Cho of\r\nTokio.\r\n\r\nIf I like Chicago it must be on account of its soiled paper money.\r\n\r\nI will exchange all my gold to it.\r\n\r\nI went to one store for a short skirt like that Chicago woman wears.\r\n\r\nIt may be a change, though shortness in hair and dress is my aversion.\r\nIt may be advantageous in showing one\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, though eternal exhibition\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t tasty.\r\n\r\nIt would be an accurate account of my reason for buying to say that I\r\nsingularly wished to use up a few jumbles of money.\r\n\r\nI dulled myself reading the advertising bills through my hotel window.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no block free from them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Vertisement!\r\n\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it horrid?\r\n\r\nI laughed, wondering why those enterprising Meriken jins don\xe2\x80\x99t employ\r\nthe extensive backs of prizefighters in the ring.\r\n\r\nUncle and I went to see the Injuns dance.\r\n\r\nHow fantastically they sang!\r\n\r\nThere was a Japanese tea-house.\r\n\r\nIt is no \xe2\x80\x9ctea-house\xe2\x80\x9d at all. It was the saddest thing I ever saw.\r\n\r\nI thought that Chicagoans were not fastidious with anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny old thing will do!\xe2\x80\x9d they might say jollily.\r\n\r\nOpen, hard-working Chicago!\r\n\r\nHas she much education?\r\n\r\n\r\n10th\xe2\x80\x94My uncle wanted me to join him in visiting a stockyard to see the\r\ndoomed pigs groaning, \xe2\x80\x9cFu, fu, fu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI declined.\r\n\r\nUncle started off alone.\r\n\r\nThere was some time before I heard someone fisting on my door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Japanese gentleman wishes to see your husband, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d a hotel\r\nattendant addressed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! My husband?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nSatemo!\r\n\r\nHow could any porter be such an ignoramus as not to distinguish between\r\nMrs. and Miss!\r\n\r\nPossibly he esteemed me \xe2\x80\x9cmodern\xe2\x80\x9d enough to marry an old man for money\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nOya, he was Mr. Consul of Chicago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk in, sir! Uchino hito will return within an hour or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I explained about \xe2\x80\x9cmy husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe both laughed.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more pleasing when in an alien country than a chit-chat\r\nin our native \xe2\x80\x9cbecha becha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJapanese speech!\r\n\r\nSuch a beautifully indefinite, poetically untidy language!\r\n\r\nI love it.\r\n\r\n\r\n11th\xe2\x80\x94It would be too much of a risk of one\xe2\x80\x99s life to stay in Chicago.\r\n\r\nGood-bye!\r\n\r\nFlowerless, birdless city, sayonara!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  BUFFALO, 12th\r\n\r\nNiagara Falls was a disappointment.\r\n\r\nUncle says I have still to learn how to be appreciative of things.\r\n\r\nA red brick chimney by the Fall spoils the whole affair, I do think.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was cross, saying that he had eaten the toughest beef of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHe seized two Canadian dimes and a bogus half-dollar in an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Uncle! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this Buffalo town awful?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  NEW YORK, 13th\r\n\r\nMiss Morning Glory has stepped into Greater New York, at last.\r\n\r\nThirteenth of March, 1900.\r\n\r\nTo-day will be the special day of my family history.\r\n\r\nMy entrance was delightful to the full.\r\n\r\nThe train stole gracefully into the city at early morn. The sky was\r\ndistinct like the lake of Biwa. The respectable face of the city\r\naccepted us charmingly.\r\n\r\nI bounced my little body in my happy thought of another chapter of life.\r\n\r\nI felt like Dante crawled out of darkest Hell, after the torture of the\r\nterrible show. (O Chicago!)\r\n\r\nOur kind Japanese consul of New York was looking after our arrival with\r\na carriage.\r\n\r\nI saw a horse-car trotting.\r\n\r\nIt encouraged me to think that even an ignorant Jap girl might find her\r\nown living here, since such an old-fashioned thing exists perfectly.\r\n\r\nI secretly fixed in my mind that I will adventure my independent life\r\nwhen the crisis demands.\r\n\r\nOur carriage rolled up Fifth Avenue to Central Park.\r\n\r\nHow often had I imagined laying me in this celebrated ground!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, let me off to smell the smell of the New York breeze!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nWhen I was stationed on the third floor of an edifice on Riverside\r\nDrive\xe2\x80\x94what a brisk name in the world!\xe2\x80\x94which was Mr. Consul\xe2\x80\x99s home, my\r\nbubbling fancies hastened down with the waters of the Hudson River under\r\nmy window.\r\n\r\nHudson River?\r\n\r\nIt is my dear old acquaintance, introduced by the ever so pleasing Mr.\r\nIrving.\r\n\r\nSee its classical profundity before my face!\r\n\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSleepy Hollow,\xe2\x80\x9d I wonder!\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the river reminded me of the Sumida Gawa of Tokio,\r\nmirroring the clouds of affectionate cherry blossoms which border its\r\nbank. It would be a remarkable idea, I thought, to petition the Mayor of\r\nNew York for the Japanese cherry-trees to parade on this side of the\r\nHudson. When they are in flower, I will open a tea-house under them, of\r\ncourse. My attire as a mistress should be a little red crape apron to\r\nbegin with. My head will be wound with a Japanese towel to endow my\r\nOriental eyes with certain better results. I will raise my voice,\r\ncalling, \xe2\x80\x9cHonourable rest! Honourable tea plucked by the choicest\r\nmusumes!\xe2\x80\x9d What a novel!\r\n\r\nRomance!\r\n\r\nHow can I live without it!\r\n\r\nIn that case I must entreat the removal of the characters on the other\r\nside, which are:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots For Sale!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any such unaristocratic sign by the Sumida Gawa.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th\xe2\x80\x94O snow, yukiya fure, fure!\r\n\r\nThe season of the city is still within the fence of winter. I was\r\ngrateful to my fate that conveyed me here to overtake my loving snow.\r\n\r\nI settled me by my window in absorption with the snow view of Hudson\r\nGawa.\r\n\r\nHow busily the snowflakes fall!\r\n\r\nTheir cautiously silent hurry made me recollect the drama of the\r\nChina-Japan war. How stealthily the soldiers marched at midnight! Can I\r\never forget how I tugged my shoji, crying \xe2\x80\x9cVictory, Dai Nippon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI raised the window, stretching out my arm. I collected the snow-petals\r\nin the hollow of my palm. I tasted them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, New York snow is as deliciously savoured as at home,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nCentral Park must have been artistically attired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOji San, let us go to the park for snow-viewing! I advise you to till a\r\nbit more poetry in yourself, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I announced.\r\n\r\nI began to change my dress before his decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n15th\xe2\x80\x94We went to the famous Brooklyn Bridge.\r\n\r\nVerily, New York gentlemen are interested with their papers in the car.\r\nNewspapers, O newspapers! There\xe2\x80\x99s no slip of a doubt that they would die\r\nwithout the sight of their newspapers. The unheroic part about them is\r\nthat they forget neatly to offer their seats to a lady. Woman loves an\r\nabsent-minded man once in a while, but never on the car, I do say.\r\n\r\nI suppose every woman of this city has to be rich.\r\n\r\nMust I equip a carriage?\r\n\r\nI do not see why I could not win the first prize with my Louisiana\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nHow I wish to fabric an every-inch-a-Japanese mansion on Fifth Avenue,\r\nand welcome a thousand tojins to hear my Jap song on Sunday!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this bridge built for Americans or Europeans, Uncle? People crossing\r\nhere use no English,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiberty Statue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI will let the Beauty statue hail from the Bay of Yedo, when I am\r\nwealthy enough to afford it.\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t Nippon signify beauty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dear is that sign, \xe2\x80\x98Beware of Pick-pockets!\xe2\x80\x99 It makes me just feel\r\nas if I were at Shinbashi station in Tokio, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it you, Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHumbly humble \xe2\x80\x99rikisha men!\r\n\r\nIf I were besieged by them imploring me to take a little honourable\r\nride, the scene would be complete.\r\n\r\nI miss such a merry car in Amerikey.\r\n\r\nWe walked down Broadway. We came to a graveyard.\r\n\r\nTombstones in the midst of commerce!\r\n\r\nO romantic New York!\r\n\r\nI wondered how Wall Street gentlemen would be struck glancing at them.\r\n\r\nWhat a soft silence hovered!\r\n\r\nThe old Gothic Church was my own ideal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, let us fall in and rest!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nThe morning service was proceeding.\r\n\r\nAlas and alas!\r\n\r\nNot one soul was there.\r\n\r\nIs this a religious city?\r\n\r\nThe inside was compact of heavenly purple air. Mr. Bishop\xe2\x80\x94whatever he\r\nmay be\xe2\x80\x94gestured like another being from a loftier realm. A beautiful boy\r\n(there\xe2\x80\x99s no greater fascination than a boy with a prayer-book) supported\r\nthe service. Intangibleness of speech is itself a divine charm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you mind asking Mr. Bishop whether he wants a sweeping girl? I\r\nwish I were given just a chance to clean such a holy church, uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I looked up to Mr. Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n16th\xe2\x80\x94It seems to me a recent style that New York ladies discard their\r\nbabies to leave them in the hands of European immigrants (very likely\r\nthey want them to learn an ungrammatical hodge-podge, as respectableness\r\nis old-fashioned) and accompany a dog with mighty affection.\r\n\r\nO my dear \xe2\x80\x9cchin\xe2\x80\x9d that I left at home!\r\n\r\nShall I call it to Amerikey?\r\n\r\nLittle loyal thing, pathetic, clinging!\r\n\r\nI am sure it would beat any other in a dog contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n17th\xe2\x80\x94I never saw such hungry eyes in my life as those of an\r\norgan-grinder, set upon the windows for a dropping penny.\r\n\r\nTo an artist they would hint of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s bloodshot eyes numbed by\r\nuseless gazing toward the light of the world.\r\n\r\nPoor Italians!\r\n\r\nThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know one thing but turning the handle.\r\n\r\nThe last two days they placed their organ\xe2\x80\x94read their sign, \xe2\x80\x9cGaribaldi &amp;\r\nCo.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94under my apartment at the same hour for my bit money.\r\n\r\nI thought one of them might be a grandson of the renowned Italian\r\npatriot. How interesting it would be to be told of his shipwreck in\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nNow three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s one more hour before their frolic music will gush.\r\n\r\nI must wrap some money in paper for them.\r\n\r\nGod bless them\xe2\x80\x94simple creatures who work hard!\r\n\r\n\r\n18th\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Consul\xe2\x80\x94an old man who sips the grayness of celibacy\xe2\x80\x94never\r\nstrays out from his official duty. He calls society and novels two\r\nrecent pieces of foolery.\r\n\r\nThe family of Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s intimate is off in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of a nice time for me is verily illegible. Tsumaranai!\r\n\r\nLast night I sketched an adventure of enlisting in the band of\r\ndomestics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital idea to examine a New York household!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when I left my\r\nbreakfast table.\r\n\r\nI humbled myself to a newspaper office with the following shamefaced\r\nadvertisement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJap girl, nineteen, good-looking, longs for a place in a family of the\r\nfirst rank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI used every kind of oratory to bring my uncle to agree to my two weeks\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n19th\xe2\x80\x94Two letters were waiting me at the office.\r\n\r\nOne from No. 296 of a certain part.\r\n\r\n296?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it sounds like \xe2\x80\x9cnikumu\xe2\x80\x9d in Japanese, meaning hatred.\r\n\r\nAnd the other was from Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nParlour maid.\r\n\r\nTwelve dollars for a month.\r\n\r\nI shall accept it, since it is the proper quarter for seeing the\r\nhigh-toned New Yorker.\r\n\r\nI feel already a servant feeling.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t discipline myself before in dusting.\r\n\r\nI will style me an honest worker for awhile. \xe2\x80\x9cToiling for my daily\r\nbread,\xe2\x80\x9d does ring an American sound, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDomestic girl has no right, I think, to sit with Messrs.
