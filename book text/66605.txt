Allah! Bishmillah. El Traprock, Dhub ak Moplah!... Wullahy!\r\nWullahy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLong, long after their echoes have died away the cries of my desert men\r\nring on my ears. Still do I see myself as, in a cloud of dust, at the\r\nhead of my band of picked nomads, my burnous floating above me so that\r\nI looked like a covered wagon, with the drumming thunder of a hundred\r\nhoofs and the wild yells of my followers, I swept like a cyclone to the\r\nrescue of one of the fairest creatures of my favorite sex.\r\n\r\nO Sarah! my desert mate, whom I have hymned in terms of pomegranates,\r\npeacock\xe2\x80\x99s-eyes and alabaster columns, lovely lady for whom I trained\r\nmy tongue to the notes of the nightingale and my fingers to the\r\nintricacies of the lute, elusive creature, startled doe that ever fled\r\nbefore my bent bow and keen-edged arrows only to be struck down at\r\nlast by agonizing love, light of my spirit, breath of my soul, warmth\r\nof my body, why, O all-of-these-and-much-more, did\xe2\x80\x99st thou flee from El\r\nSheik Traprock, Dhub of the Moplah Tribe?... Wullahy!\r\n\r\nAlas! She may not answer, my fair bride of the silences, for she has\r\nbeen plucked from me, she has passed beyond my ken. Let me then speak\r\nfor her, my sweet bird, my tower of gold-and-ivory, my tall building\r\nagleam with rubies, my ... but first let me descend from the heaven of\r\nher memory and cease from singing of the musical Moplahs.\r\n\r\nIn other words let me get back to earth and, in regular language, try\r\nto describe her as I first saw her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on the pier-head at Cannes: the time, sunset. She stood,\r\noutlined against the flaming sky, a tall, angular figure. In the fading\r\nlight I took no note of details but there was that in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsilhouette which gripped me. My heart stopped ... missed a beat ... and\r\nhurried on.\r\n\r\nStrange and mysterious, the influence of human personalities! Her mere\r\npresence was a challenge at which I bristled. Through my nerve-centers\r\nflashed deep messages of interest, attraction ... animosity. Here,\r\nplainly, was no easy quarry.\r\n\r\nAs tense and alert as a setter on-the-point I stood watching the lean\r\nfigure. At the back of my head I felt a light tickling sensation as if\r\na hand had passed upward over my hair; my nostrils, I dare say, dilated.\r\n\r\nHer back was toward me and she was gazing at the luminous waters of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBaie des Anges.\xe2\x80\x9d Caught in her close-cropped, reddish-brown hair\r\nthe last sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays shone in a golden aureole so that in this respect\r\nshe might have been one of the angels for whom the bay is named. But\r\nthe angelic suggestion ended there. In all else she was warm, vital,\r\nhuman, a vibrant personality with a hint of almost masculine strength\r\nbeneath the folds of her tan silk jacket and short walking skirt. One\r\narm was akimbo and through the triangle thus formed I could see, by odd\r\ncoincidence, the distant shape of my yawl, the Kawa, from which I had\r\njust landed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY SARAH WIMPOLE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mere presence was a challenge at which I bristled. Here was no\r\neasy quarry.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady Sarah Wimpole]\r\n\r\nMy arrival in Cannes had been meaningless, the chance debarkation of a\r\nwanderer in search of rest after arduous voyaging in the far North, the\r\naimless pursuit of warmth, comfort and sunshine. I had intended,\r\nas far as my formless plans had any intention, stopping over the night\r\nat Cannes, then pushing on to the various Mediterranean ports, through\r\nSuez to the great East. My vague objective was the Nicobars, off\r\nSumatra, where I had promised to call on a devoted old Andamanian when\r\nthe opportunity offered.\r\n\r\nNow, in an instant all that was changed. Vanished my Andamanian friend,\r\nmy vague intentions. Here, within a few feet of me, in the person\r\nof this unknown woman was adventure, mystery, romance, an immediate\r\nobjective, a citadel to be stormed, a problem to be solved, an\r\nadversary to be overcome, a mate to be ... who knows what lies in wait\r\nfor him around the corner? I only know that in a twinkling life had\r\nbecome purposeful, fascinating, electric.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to feel something of this riotous zip which I was projecting\r\ntoward her for she turned suddenly and with a quick, awkward gesture,\r\npulled on a soft straw hat and began walking in my direction. I\r\nimmediately withdrew among a maze of packing-cases, orange boxes and\r\nother freight with which the pier was cumbered. Instinct told me it\r\nwas not the time for our meeting. I had come ashore only for a few\r\nnecessary supplies and I was very much in fatigue uniform. Also I was\r\nbare-footed in which condition a man can never look his best.\r\n\r\nA moment later she strode unsuspectingly past the pile of orange\r\nboxes which screened me. I caught the impression of a distinctly\r\npatrician type with rigidly drawn features in which an aquiline nose\r\npredominated. I had only a glimpse but, as in the wink of a camera\r\nshutter, a clear image of that austere profile was imprinted upon the\r\nsensitive plate of my soul. Developing and printing were to come later.\r\nOne thing was certain; she was a personage, not a mere person.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the pier she vanished. Vaulting from my fruit crate I\r\nmade toward the string-piece where my dingy was gently bumping. I must\r\nmake ship and haul my evening clothes from stowage. Once more I was on\r\nthe trail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFate does not cheat those who trust her. Without arrangement on my part\r\nI saw my lady again within three days. It was bound to happen.\r\n\r\nThough changed entirely as to costume, I knew her instantly. She was at\r\nthe roulette table in the glittering salle-de-jeu at Monte Carlo. From\r\nafar I saw the tip of a blue ostrich plume, the nodding feathers of\r\nwhich seemed to brush against my consciousness. They could belong to\r\nnone other.\r\n\r\nAgain the imperious call and challenge flashed between us as I took a\r\nseat opposite hers where I could study her features while I tossed my\r\nchips on the table. She looked up at once and I held her with my gaze.\r\nFor the first time our glances met. I was oblivious of my surroundings.\r\nThe brilliant room, the gay crowd, the alert croupier, all sank into\r\nnothingness as I focussed my eyes on hers, resolved that in this first\r\ninterchange I should not yield. Her eyes, amazingly blue, looked into\r\nmine for a long instant, then dropped to the Cross of St. Botolphe\r\nwhich glittered on my shirt-bosom. I wore no other jewels save the\r\nagate-and-iron signet ring which his Britannic majesty--but that is\r\nneither here nor there. A faint smile played at the corners of my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s lips. It was enough. She had taken note of my presence.\r\n\r\nShe was plainly a great lady of the type which England alone can\r\nproduce, one of those rangy, imperial, dominating creatures in whom\r\nseem to be compacted innumerable generations of conquering invaders,\r\nDerby-winners, stalwart cricketers and astute statesmen. The prevailing\r\ncolor of her person was red, or, to be more accurate, sandy, the\r\nshort hair being without any tinge of the pink or henna which reeks of\r\nthe coiffeurs\xe2\x80\x99 art. Her complexion was of a salmon or apricot shade,\r\nmade almost golden by the overtone of pale, downy fuzz which so often\r\naccompanies it. Crowning the crisply curled locks was a regal tiara\r\nof large emeralds into which the blue ostrich feather was stuck at\r\na jaunty angle. Never before had I seen a tiara on bobbed hair and\r\nthe effect coupled with the red and green color scheme was extremely\r\ndiverting. One felt at once that here was a woman who would dare\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nBeing black myself the aureate color of her skin struck on my heart\r\nlike a gong. Her brows and lashes were so pale as to be almost\r\nalbinesque. Above and below a generous, full-lipped mouth her dominant\r\nnose contended for supremacy with an obstinate chin. Tanned cheeks\r\nspoke plainly of life in the open as did her strong but well-kept hands\r\nupon which shone several important emeralds. But what stirred me most\r\nwere her arms.\r\n\r\nCostume makes little or no impression on me. The general effect of what\r\nshe wore was hard and steely, but gorgeous. The color was mainly white\r\nwith a great slash of sky-blue introduced somewhere. I had the feeling\r\nof being in the presence of a lady-mayor or an important ambassadress.\r\nIn any case, her arms were exposed beyond the elbow and to my delight\r\nthey were generously freckled, not with coarse, country-style,\r\nginger-bread mottlings, but with fine, detached discs no bigger than\r\npin heads and pure gold in color. Over these pale paillettes grew the\r\nsilky fur of which I have spoken. For some reason freckles always\r\nexcite me, probably because I can never hope to have any except\r\nvicariously.\r\n\r\nShe was playing for high stakes, using only hundred-franc chips and\r\nwinning with a consistency that attracted the inevitable cortege about\r\nher chair, the jackals who try to follow a winner or steal a system by\r\npeering over one\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nI could but admire the coolness with which she turned and pushed away\r\nthe face of an ornamental Russian woman, the Princess Sonia Subikoff,\r\nnotorious adventuress and parasite, whose covetous features kept\r\nthrusting themselves under the player\xe2\x80\x99s elbow. Done by one less sure of\r\nherself the action would have provoked a terrific scene. As it was, the\r\noutraged Princess, _soi-disant_, struck savagely at the blonde back of\r\nthe English woman. The blow resounded as if she had hit a packing-case,\r\nproducing no more effect than a shrug and a cheerful grin as _la_\r\nSubikoff made off, nursing a lame hand and hissing spiteful comment\r\non the _animal anglaise_. Coolly, superbly, the Anglo-Saxon continued\r\nher play, placing her chips with a nonchalant sweep of her great\r\narms. In every movement was the same underlying hint of powerful bony\r\nsub-structure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Elle est dure_,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice at my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Qui \xc3\xa7a?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La belle laide, en face._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned with an instinctive hostility toward the speaker, his voice,\r\nmanner ... everything. To discuss a woman, openly, in a public\r\nplace.... _La belle laide!_ ... and yet, was she not just that? There\r\nis a merciless precision in the Latin tongue.\r\n\r\nMy neighbors were a type I detest,--Peruvians, I judged by the\r\nbarbarous Spanish clang of their French; sleek, oily, anointed\r\nwith perfume from their lacquered hair to their equally shining\r\nboots, tailored, corsetted, manicured and with that fawning look so\r\nunpleasantly suggestive of the oriental. One was playing for small\r\nstakes while his companion looked on, but I noticed that both were\r\nnarrowly watching the English woman and exchanging whispered comments.\r\n\r\nSomething was in the wind and my submerged sense of suspicion began to\r\nstir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Flute!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the South-Americans, which is a strong\r\nimprecation in French, \xe2\x80\x9cShe wins like a fiend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Zut_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other as his last chip passed under the rake.\r\n\r\nI turned to my own play, a system which I picked up in Buenos Ayres,\r\na sure winner of small amounts. After two hours I was four and a half\r\nfrancs ahead and the pastime was beginning to bore me. Rising, I saw\r\nthat the Peruvians had separated, one having crossed to the other\r\nside of the table directly back of the English woman while the other\r\nloitered near the croupier\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\r\n\r\nIn a flash I divined their plan just in time to act. As the man near\r\nthe croupier engaged him in conversation I saw the other\xe2\x80\x99s hand shoot\r\nout and seize a large pile of bank-notes weighted down with a stack of\r\ngolden louis. I could not possibly reach the fellow or the louis, but I\r\ncould and did reach the door.\r\n\r\nAs our paths converged I saw that in his left hand he held an\r\nautomatic. Acting entirely on instinct I threw in his face a handful\r\nof small change, keys, pen-knife, etc., from my trouser pocket. At\r\nthe same instant I dove. His bullet roared, harmless, over my head and\r\ntogether we crashed to the marble floor. The thief had never seen a\r\nfoot-ball game and expected something entirely different.\r\n\r\nAs we struggled he attempted to turn the weapon on me but my grip was\r\nlike steel. The room was in an uproar. Hither and yon we threshed about\r\nover the polished pavement. In one of our gyrations my foot caught\r\nunder the teak-wood base of a huge Japanese jar. Fascinated I watched\r\nit tremble, totter ... and fall into a thousand fragments about us.\r\nThen the confusion was punctuated by a sharp report and my adversary\r\nlay suddenly still. He had shot himself during the struggle, whether by\r\naccident or design I can not say.\r\n\r\nRising I looked about and tendered a handful of golden coins and\r\n_billets-de-banque_ to the tall, masterful woman who stood near me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTop-hole,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quite simply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe handed me her card, which I accepted, bowing. There were some\r\ntedious formalities necessary at the local _poste de police_ and it was\r\nafter midnight when I reached my room and took the card from my pocket.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Sarah Wimpole,\xe2\x80\x9d I read beneath a simple crest, a swan volant\r\nholding a snake in its beak and the device \xe2\x80\x9c_Nunc pro tunc._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur paths had crossed. Matters were coming on apace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Our First Interview_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Traprock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held the card which had preceded me. Saluting in the continental\r\nmanner, I bent over her extended hand, noting the strong, square nails\r\nwith their perfect crescent moons at the base.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Wimpole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe motioned me to a complicated wicker chair of Malaysian make which\r\nbrought back vividly my years in Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were splendid the other night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her voice surprised me.\r\nIt was harsh, like the note of a grackle or the cry of a sea-bird, full\r\nof strange breaks, guttural depths and moving dissonances.\r\n\r\nAs we talked I took in the details of our surroundings. We were\r\nseated in the morning-room of the Villa Bianca, an exquisitely\r\nappointed mansion of lemon-yellow stucco embowered in a riot of roses,\r\nbougainvill\xc3\xa9a and flowering bugloss-vines. From beyond the walls of the\r\nformal entrance garden the noises of the town reached us faintly. The\r\nMonocan populace were celebrating the f\xc3\xaate of St. Yf whose favor is\r\nsupposed to bring good luck at the gaming tables.\r\n\r\nGlancing at my hostess I re-experienced the conviction that she was\r\na surprising woman. Odd indeed was the contrast she made with her\r\nsurroundings. The room was of an indescribable daintiness. Overhead\r\narched a pale blue plaster dome upon which painted birds flitted among\r\nfleecy clouds or perched upon blossoming branches. The side-walls,\r\nexcept for door and window openings, were covered with coral pink\r\nstudded regularly with small crystal buttons, the spacing being\r\naccentuated by a connecting diaper-design of silver thread.\r\n\r\nFrom the cornice, at the beginning of the dome, hung a deep valance\r\nof white lace which was repeated in the long window curtains and\r\ninnumerable cushions on chairs, _chaise-longue_ and foot-stools.\r\nThe whole room, in fact, seethed with a sort of suds of lace and\r\n_chiffonerie_ like an old-fashioned valentine in the midst of which\r\nLady Sarah sat enthroned in a curious chair contrived to represent a\r\nsea-shell.\r\n\r\nHer costume, as nearly as I could make it out, was a voluminous silk\r\nprowler or slip-cover of silk matching the walls, and like them,\r\nedged with lace. An intricate mob-cap covered all but a severe bang of\r\nred-brown hair which shrieked at its dainty surroundings as loudly as\r\nthe green parrot who, raucous and unconfined, swung acrobatically about\r\nhis perch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, Selim,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded the bird\xe2\x80\x99s mistress; then, having noted my\r\nlooks of appraisal, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this place hideous? I hate a room that foams\r\nat the mouth. My husband takes it for the season. Poor creature, his\r\ntaste is ghastly; he was born in Nottingham. This house was built by\r\nthe government for one of the old king\xe2\x80\x99s mistresses. It gives Wimpole a\r\nthrill merely to rent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sank back languidly into the recesses of her shell, suppressing a\r\nyawn and I could see the faint lines running from the corners of her\r\neyes to the lobes of her ears, lines of disillusionment, of hunger\r\ndenied, of ...\r\n\r\nDuring the interval since our meeting at the Casino I had learned\r\nsomething of her tragic story. Born amid the highest and most\r\nrefined nobility, the daughter of Sir Rupert Alleyne and Mary, Lady\r\nBeaverboard, she had seen her ancestral fortune lost by her father in\r\nspeculative adventures induced by the old taint of the Alleyne madness.\r\nIn his fifty-third year Sir Rupert inherited by the laws of succession\r\nthe estates and titles of the Beaverboard interests, becoming\r\nsubsequently Duke of Axminster. These honors marked the beginning of\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nThe final crash came with Sir Rupert\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to corner the Italian\r\nantique market together with all the important trans-atlantic steamship\r\nlines, his idea being to completely control the American demand\r\nfor ancestral portraits and _objets d\xe2\x80\x99art_. The stately halls of\r\nAlleynecourt were thronged with continental adventurers freighted down\r\nwith spurious Botticelli, Allegretti and other masters.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke, raving, was carted away to Old Drury, his daughter\r\nsought refuge with her uncle, Egbert Alleyne, whose scientific works on\r\ngraptolites and stromatoporoids kept him impoverished and ill-at-ease\r\nin a tiny cottage in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nHere Horace Wimpole found her. He was at that time senior partner in\r\nthe firm of Wimpole &amp; Tripp, laces, of Nottingham, with a peerage in\r\nview and an o\xe2\x80\x99er-vaulting snobbery which he saw prospects of gratifying\r\nby an alliance with the penurious but well-connected Sarah Alleyne. On\r\nher side it was a bitter bargain,--her youth, her rugged beauty, her\r\nhopes of romance in exchange for wealth and comfort for herself and\r\nher crazed sire. She accepted.\r\n\r\nA week after the Westminster Gazette announced the bestowal of a title\r\nupon Horace, Lord Wimpole, the ennobled merchant led his aristocratic\r\nbride from the church portico. Blithely rang the bells of St. George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand lustily rose the cheers of the bluff English onlookers whose\r\nworship of nobility and all the panoply thereof is the enduring wonder\r\nof the world. Wimpole promptly did his duty by his father-in-law and\r\nhad the ancient zany removed from Old Drury to a private padded-cell\r\nin a fashionable asylum. The old man\xe2\x80\x99s last whimsy was that he was\r\nAdmiral Napier and he was given the run of a small garden where, in\r\nfull uniform and spy-glass in hand, he made observations and issued\r\nauthoritative commands.\r\n\r\nLady Wimpole was now free, except for the encumbrance of her low-bred\r\nhusband who had virtually retired, master of a colossal fortune by\r\nmeans of which he proposed to live up to his new estate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD HORACE WIMPOLE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a business man he was a success, for he ran true to type, but as an\r\naristocrat he was a hopeless false-alarm.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Horace Wimpole]\r\n\r\nIt was here he made his fatal error. As a business man he was a\r\nsuccess, for he ran true to type, but as an aristocrat he was a\r\nhopeless false-alarm. Contrary to previous statements, in matters of\r\nbreeding kind hearts can not compare with coronets, particularly\r\nwhen the latter have been in the family for ten generations.\r\n\r\nFinding himself a failure in the fields of sport, riding to or from\r\nthe hounds, cricket and the active exercises, intellectually unable\r\nto compete in cultural pursuits such as the writing of memoirs or the\r\ncollecting of sea shells and butterflies, Wimpole was thrown back on\r\nthe last recourse of affluent ignorance, travel and dissipation.\r\n\r\nIn the latter field he showed a natural aptitude which, had it been\r\ncaught and cultivated in some previous generation, might have made him\r\na rather attractive rake. But it came too late; he was merely beastly.\r\nLady Wimpole was quite frank about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband,--is he with you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nShe raised her beautiful pinkish eye-lids toward the ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cStill\r\nasleep ... he was unusually crocked last night. You know he has taken\r\nup the vices. He tries to be brutal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he beat you?\xe2\x80\x9d I put the question frankly because I knew it was\r\nthe traditional thing and I felt that she would appreciate a direct\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would like to but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dare. He does\r\nhis worst however. He bites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped back the soft sleeve of her gown and extended an arm. I\r\nshrank back in horror. The dog! A semi-circle of teeth-marks marred the\r\nsalmon-silkiness of the loveliest fore-arm in the world.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily I paled and yet felt curiously relieved. This proof of\r\ndastardly conduct on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s part seemed to make easier the thing\r\nI knew I should eventually have to do, namely, take this gorgeous\r\ncreature from him.\r\n\r\nTurning toward the parrot to hide my emotion I said \xe2\x80\x9cMadame,--I am\r\nsorry to bring you bad news ... but we are both summoned to appear\r\nbefore the local police magistrate the day after tomorrow. The\r\ncharge is murder. You are a material witness. The affair is entirely\r\ntechnical, but there are unseen influences at work. The young man,--the\r\nscoundrel who attempted to steal your gold, was well-connected, of an\r\nold Peruvian family. They have cabled representations to the Monacan\r\ngovernment. The whole affair has the look of a nasty, political\r\nembroglio. It may last some time. I was once called as a witness to a\r\ntrolley accident in Jerusalem and six months afterward....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will hear all that later. Today is Tuesday. Call for me Thursday\r\nmorning--what is the hour? eleven? Good--be here at ten-thirty: I will\r\nnot fail you. Adios.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain saluting her _\xc3\xa0 la fran\xc3\xa7aise_, I departed.\r\n\r\nFor two days I carried her image in my heart. I know not how it is with\r\nothers but when I have once decided to love a certain person I find\r\nit a simple matter to do so. At the first glimpse of Lady Wimpole my\r\nheart, had, so to speak, assumed a crouching posture. It only remained\r\nfor me to tell my emotions what to do, just as I might direct my great\r\npolice dog, Graustein, to stop a suspicious character. By now I was\r\nthoroughly aroused. The memory of those atrocious teeth-marks and that\r\nblemished fore-arm were fresh fuel.\r\n\r\nAt exactly ten-thirty on the appointed Thursday I approached the villa.\r\nIt was close shuttered and wore a vacant, deserted look at which my\r\nheart sank. The gate was locked and the bell jangled noisily among\r\ndeserted rose bushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurses!\xe2\x80\x9d I ground out between clenched teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was toying with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA step on the gravel interrupted my bitter reflections. It was the old\r\ngardener.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Madame est partie_,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, \xe2\x80\x9c_et Monsieur aussi ... sur le\r\nyacht ... ce matin._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA glance toward the bay confirmed his statement; the slim white shape\r\nof Wimpole\xe2\x80\x99s yacht, the Undine, was no longer in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did they leave no message?\xe2\x80\x9d I demanded.\r\n\r\nHe turned aside smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Un mot? Sais pas ... c\xe2\x80\x99est-\xc3\xa0-dire ... peut-\xc3\xaatre ..._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw what he was driving at. Damn the baksheesh hunting tribes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, thrusting a crisp bank-note through the bars. Seizing\r\nit he fumbled in his blouse and produced a large envelope which I\r\nclutched eagerly, tearing it open as the bearer disappeared into\r\nthe depths of the garden. Beneath the now familiar crest, in a bold\r\nmasculine handwriting, I read the simple words, \xe2\x80\x9cMeet me in the desert,\r\nS. W.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis thwarting of my desire, this baffling of my purpose--was the\r\none thing needed to set my blood on fire. On the instant I turned\r\nand ran down the hill toward the water-side, all thought of Monacan\r\ncourts-of-law completely forgotten. At the precise moment when the\r\nstately judge-advocate in his purple and green _laetitia_ or official\r\nrobe opened the Monacan Court, the little Kawa was slipping over the\r\nSouthern horizon toward the African mountain wall beyond which lie the\r\nlimitless sands of the Sahara.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet me in the desert,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said. No desert on earth could be big\r\nenough to hide her. My emotions were up, and in full cry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Into the Great Unknown_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica! Far away I sighted the purple shadow of the land of mystery,\r\nthe low-lying coast-line and interior wall of mountains behind which\r\nlay the vastness of Sahara.\r\n\r\nWe struck the coast at Djidjelli, further East than we had anticipated.\r\nCaptain Triplett, my navigator, said that compasses always acted\r\nqueerly in these waters which he ascribed to the influence of occult\r\ndesert powers, outraged divinities and the like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s them genuses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey raise hell with yer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBe that as it may we had to veer sharply in order to make Algiers on\r\nthe third day after clearing from and out of Monte Carlo. The harbor\r\nshowed no trace of the Undine and according to the port-authorities she\r\nhad not touched there, nor was there any record of the Wimpole party at\r\nthe leading hotels or travel bureaus. They were gone, swallowed up in\r\nthe immense folds of the silent, brooding Southland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet me in the desert!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s parting cry rang in my ears. In\r\nit I detected the first note of appeal suggesting her growing need\r\nof me, a need of which she was perhaps still unconscious, but which\r\nmight grow to who knows what. Why was I so certain she referred to\r\nSahara, the Great Desert? I can not say, but it seemed inevitable that\r\nshe would choose the largest; it was in keeping with the majestic,\r\nmonumental nature of the woman. Whatever the reason I was positive that\r\nsomewhere in those uncharted wastes I should find her. Facing them, as\r\nI stood on the quarter-deck with Whinney, my acting-first-officer, I\r\npressed Lady Wimpole\xe2\x80\x99s letter in my breast pocket and whispered softly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come, my lady of the desert, I come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Whinney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d I answered shortly and went below.\r\n\r\nAnother certainty, arrived at during my trans-Mediterranean trip,\r\nloomed large in my plans. Re-visiting the desert after an absence of\r\nten years I decided that I should assume my title of Sheik of the\r\nMoplah Bedouins which had been conferred upon me in recognition of\r\nhaving saved a native caravan from certain death due to the sudden\r\nfailure of the wells at the Oasis of Sus.\r\n\r\nSince that memorable time the Sheik, as an institution, has acquired a\r\ntremendous sentimental and romantic value which fell in admirably with\r\nmy quest of the remarkable English woman who had yanked me so forcibly\r\nfrom the spiritual doldrums.\r\n\r\nTunis, Algiers, Fez and Agadir, all the important North African\r\ntowns--now do a thriving business in Sheik-outfitting, the bazaars\r\nringing with the cries of costumers, burnous-boys, veiled Circassian\r\nbeauties with their trays of turbans, dealers in arms and accoutrement,\r\nsaddle-sellers and camel merchants. But I needed none of this shoddy\r\nmaterial designed entirely for the tourist trade. What I wanted was the\r\nreal thing.\r\n\r\nTwo days after my arrival in Algiers I stumbled on Ab-Domen Allah, the\r\nfaithful dragoman who had dragged me through Turkey and Arabia in 1902.\r\nIt was sheer Traprock luck, for he was the very man I wanted, capable,\r\nresourceful and devoted.\r\n\r\nOver a glass of coffee on the terrace of the Di Baccho I explained my\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Si, si_,\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed, patting his huge bulk delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand. I will attend to everything. See, we had best do thus and\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDipping his fore-finger in the coffee he drew an excellent likeness of\r\nAfrica on the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will enter here at Rascora on the very western edge of the desert.\r\nYou can go round by water: I will meet you there with the camels. Thus\r\nwe will go through the desert the long way. You will miss nothing. You\r\nare looking for something, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated, but he burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman! Aha, my friend. You have not changed since I met you in\r\nSkutari! You devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrawing back from the table in order to give himself room to shake he\r\ntrembled like a mountain of jelly until a glance at his wrist-watch\r\ntold him it was the evening hour for worship. He could not kneel but\r\nturned his chair toward Mecca and performed the orthodox calisthenics\r\nin a sketchy but satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nPersonally I was more than willing to let him have his laugh in\r\nexchange for having secured his services. Matters of detail could now\r\nbe dismissed. At dawn the next day I weighed anchor for Tangier and\r\npoints west, slipping rapidly down the Moroccan coast with short stops\r\nat Mogador, Rio de Oro and, finally, Rascora.\r\n\r\nRapid though the trip was it took the better part of a fortnight\r\nallowing Ab-Domen no more than time to assemble our caravan. During\r\nthe interval I took up the re-study of the desert languages, Berber,\r\nArabic, Bedouin and the main Sudanese dialects all of which I had\r\nfairly well mastered before we rounded the gleaming cliffs of Cape\r\nBlanco. I also gave considerable time to exercising myself in the\r\nflorid style of speech without which no Sheik is really a Sheik. During\r\nthese periods of study I would stand near the capstan and apostrophize\r\nmy lost lady in the most poetic terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO thou! beautiful as the dawn and rounded as the bursting lotus-bud\r\nwhose voice is as the cooing of a dove calling gently to its mate, lo,\r\nfrom afar I come to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese proceedings astonished the crew. In fact I overheard Captain\r\nTriplett say to Whinney, \xe2\x80\x9cThe old man is cuckoo,\xe2\x80\x9d to which the flippant\r\nfirst-officer replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYou gushed a geyser.\xe2\x80\x9d I had to reprimand them\r\nboth severely.\r\n\r\nAnother exercise to which I devoted considerable time was the\r\npractising of that stern, aloof mien which is the proper Sheik-ish\r\nattitude. This was very hard for me for my nature is genial. However\r\nno one ever heard of anyone clapping one of these portentous Arabs\r\non the shoulder with a \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Sheik; how\xe2\x80\x99s tricks.\xe2\x80\x9d That sort of\r\nthing would mean death according to modern literary standards and I\r\nendeavored to convey this idea to my companions whenever they were\r\nfamiliar which was always. I almost precipitated a row when I said\r\none day to Whinney, \xe2\x80\x9cPeace, thou ill-begotten son of a base-born\r\nmule-driver.\xe2\x80\x9d... He seized a belaying pin with the light of mayhem in\r\nhis eyes and I had great difficulty in explaining the purely figurative\r\nmeaning of my words.\r\n\r\nIn private, however, I continued the practise of speeches redolent of\r\nthe great eastern orators who are pastmasters of the art of saying it\r\nwith flowers, while I also steeled my heart to a cruelty toward all\r\nwoman-kind which is an absolute prerequisite of successful Sheik-ery.\r\nOften, in the privacy of my cabin, I would seize my rolled-up steamer\r\nrug by the throat and cry harshly \xe2\x80\x9cSo, I have you at last, have I?\r\nRemember, woman, you are mine! ... all mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined these studies filled in the time admirably and made\r\nme mad with longing for the actual desert voyage to begin.\r\n\r\nTwo days after dropping anchor Ab-Domen appeared on the outskirts\r\nof Rascora winding his way down from the Atlean foot-hills, bells\r\ntinkling, flutes playing and camels smelling. He had assembled a\r\ncomplete outfit equipped with everything for an indefinite stay in the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nI had decided on camels as our motive power for I loathe such modern\r\ncontraptions as motorboats in Venice and motor-trucks in the desert. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite fancy myself as a Sheik arriving on a truck and crying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLo! it is I, the son of the Eagle.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides I would probably get my\r\nburnous caught in the fly-wheel which would be a pity as it was really\r\nmagnificent, a true Moplah Sheik costume, pure white with a number of\r\ntricky gold ornaments.\r\n\r\nAb-Domen had done a gorgeous job in selecting my camels. During his\r\nshopping he had been accompanied by my friend Herman Swank, for many\r\nyears my super-cargo. We stood together as the herd wound its way into\r\nthe village under its own power and Swank gave me some interesting\r\ninformation on their fine points.\r\n\r\nQualifications to be considered in buying a camel are water-and-weight\r\ncapacity, hair-crop and stupidity. The first consideration is how many\r\nmiles per gallon can the beast do. Curiously, just as with automobiles,\r\ndealers invariably lie about this point.\r\n\r\nWeight-capacity is tested by loading the camel until he can\xe2\x80\x99t get up\r\nand then removing small amounts until he _just_ can, thus giving the\r\ntraffic all that it can possibly bear.\r\n\r\nThe hair-crop of the camel is one of the staple harvests of the desert\r\narea and is of tremendous value for the local manufacture of ropes,\r\nshawls, blankets, etc., and for the export trade in camels-hair\r\nbrushes, used the world over by water-color artists. Water colors are,\r\nof course, out of the question in the Sahara where there is very little\r\ncolor and almost no water.\r\n\r\nStupidity, the last named attribute, is an essential in a good camel.\r\nFortunately most of them possess it to an amazing degree. Without it\r\nno animal would think of entering the desert let alone carrying the\r\ncrushing burdens which are imposed upon them. Ab-Domen had combed the\r\ncountry for stupid camels, among which the bactrian booby-prize went\r\nto DeLong, my own mount. Whinney bestrode Rufus, a reddish beast while\r\nSwank called his Clotilde in memory of a young woman he had known in\r\nthe Latin Quarter. They were all single humped Arabians which are\r\nsuperior to the Asiatic variety, just why I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. After having\r\nridden them a week it seemed impossible that they could be superior to\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nWe left Triplett at Rascora whence he was to take the Kawa round to\r\nCairo. I allowed six months for our trans-African trek. Two days after\r\nhis departure we faced the East in the conventional caravan formation,\r\nled by an ass, the emblem of good luck. Our number had been increased\r\nby approximately sixty nomads of my own tribe, the Moplahs, a number of\r\nminor-Sheiks and a rabble of desert folk, Walatu-s, Gogo-s and Humda-s.\r\nTo these must be added the _doolahs_ or black camel-boys who closed the\r\nfile while Ab-Domen, on a powerful camel, held a roving commission,\r\ndarting hither and yon, or to and fro as needed.\r\n\r\nOur first objective was the Oasis of Arag-Wan. For several days we\r\npassed through tiny desert villages, Uskeft, Shinghit, Tejigia and\r\nothers. There was no trace of the Wimpoles, but in this I was not\r\ndisappointed. It would have been humiliating to find her too quickly,\r\nto stumble upon my lady on the first day out, to say \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _there_\r\nyou are!\xe2\x80\x9d and to have the whole episode over. I felt sure that our\r\nmeeting would be more dramatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AB-DOMEN ALLAH\r\n\r\nDr. Traprock\xe2\x80\x99s faithful Dragoman who, as the author says, \xe2\x80\x9cliterally\r\ndragged\xe2\x80\x9d him through the desert.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ab-Domen Allah]\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day we faced the empty desert. Never had I felt more\r\ncompletely a Sheik. My friends Swank and Whinney had caught my\r\nenthusiasm as well as my mode of dress and address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail, El-Swanko!\xe2\x80\x9d I would say; \xe2\x80\x9cSon of the well-known morn and\r\nillustrious evening-star, may thy blessings be as the hairs on thy\r\ncamel\xe2\x80\x99s head and thy bed as soft as his padded hoof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack at you, Dhubel-dhub, Sheik of the Moplah Chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend\r\nwould cry, being a bit unpracticed in the fine points of sheik-talk.\r\nBut he came on rapidly and was soon able to converse fluently in the\r\nornate hyperbole of the country.\r\n\r\nThe desert and the ocean have been frequently compared but happenings\r\nof the next few days were to bring this comparison home in no uncertain\r\nterms. Swank and Whinney suffered acutely from their first experience\r\non camel-back and even I felt somewhat uneasy until I became accustomed\r\nto DeLong\xe2\x80\x99s pitch and roll. The \xe2\x80\x9cship-of-the-desert\xe2\x80\x9d is no idle\r\npoeticism.\r\n\r\nBeyond Tejigia we were completely out of sight of water. No trace of\r\npassing craft broke the horizon about us. Like an admiral at the head\r\nof his fleet I scanned the sky anxiously. Three days passed. On the\r\nfourth a violent head wind forced us to tack in order to keep the sand\r\nout of our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I rose to face a titanic struggle between earth and\r\nsky. The desert was rising. After a three-mile advance I gave the order\r\nto heave-to. The camels were anchored fore-and-aft, to long tent-pegs.\r\nThe sand became increasingly fluid. Low ripples running over its face\r\nrapidly rose to waves which dashed their stinging spray over us with\r\nthe rasping hiss of a devil\xe2\x80\x99s hot breath. In the lulls I could hear the\r\nwails of the _doolahs_ and the bubbling roar of the camels.\r\n\r\nAb-Domen fought with the resource and bravery of a great commander. We\r\nwere now all crouching low against the blast.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw Ab-Domen point excitedly toward the East. A gigantic\r\ntidal-wave of sand was bearing down upon us through the murk. Of what\r\nfollowed I can only give a dim impression. I heard the parting of\r\nseveral anchor ropes and the screams of the anguished beasts as they\r\nand their riders were swept into oblivion. Then, as if to administer\r\nthe _coup-de-grace_, two enormous sand-spouts loomed up from the\r\nsouth, hideous spinning wraiths, whirling dervishes of the desert,\r\npersonifying all the diabolic malevolence of this ghastly land. One\r\nmissed us, passing within a few yards of DeLong and myself; the other\r\nmoved directly across the compact mass of _doolahs_ who lay screaming\r\nin its path. I had a glimpse of a score of black bodies sucked upward\r\ninto the swirling column, spinning helplessly in the vortex with arms\r\nand legs out-thrust, grasping or kicking at the empty air. Then all was\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive hours later I dug myself out of suffocation and sand. The storm\r\nhad passed. Twelve _doolahs_ and two camels were missing. The rest\r\nwere badly disorganized. But the desert lay, calm and peaceful about\r\nus. We had weathered the storm and, to my infinite joy, there, in the\r\ndistance, the white walls and bending palms of an oasis gleamed in the\r\nevening sunlight--the wells of Arag-Wan. We had won through!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_The Wandering Wimpoles_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nStill no trace of the Wimpoles. I was up early and out betimes. We had\r\npitched our tents and rested our caravan in the shadow of the palms of\r\nArag-Wan. Here our water-skins, canteens, camels and other containers\r\nwere filled to overflowing. A trace of French thrift surprised me. The\r\nwells had been fenced off and equipped with a red Bowser-pump guarded\r\nby a half-cast Berber in brown cloak and battered visor-cap bearing the\r\nlegend \xe2\x80\x9c_Colonies d\xe2\x80\x99Afrique_.\xe2\x80\x9d There was free-air but not free-water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Combien de gallons?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old chap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill \xe2\x80\x99em up,\xe2\x80\x9d I ordered, knowing that the next station was hundreds of\r\nmiles to the eastward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE OASIS OF ARAG-WAN\r\n\r\nHerman Swank, Traprock\xe2\x80\x99s intrepid follower, superintending the\r\nimportant process of filling the camels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At the Oasis of Arag-Wan]\r\n\r\nDuring the filling process I wandered out into the desert. The air was\r\ncool and delicious. A soft breeze whispered through the palm trees in\r\nthe branches of which chattered a lavender _tabit_ or doctor-bird.\r\nBeyond the edge of oasis the low-growing palmettos, oleanders and\r\ngun-sandarachs dwindled to stunted prickly pears and leprous leaved\r\nsquill-vines among which I noted the fresh tracks of several audad and\r\na jerboa.\r\n\r\nIntensely interested as I am in the secrets of nature\xe2\x80\x99s book I became\r\ncompletely absorbed in the perusal of this fascinating page, or perhaps\r\nI should say foot-note. Bending over the imprinted tracks in silent\r\nstudy I became aware of a soft tread on the sand back of me. I turned\r\nmy head silently but though I made the motion with the greatest caution\r\nit was enough to stampede a flock of seven magnificent whiffle-hens,\r\nbirds of the utmost rarity, a cross between the ostrich and the bustard.\r\n\r\nThey were off at once, loping across the desert with that supremely\r\neasy and deceptive swing of their slightly bowed legs, traveling at a\r\ngait which breaks the heart of the swiftest horse, their snowy plumes\r\ngleaming in the sunshine. But what brought me up all standing was\r\nthe fact that the leader of the flock sported in the center of his\r\ntail-feathers a gorgeous ostrich plume which very evidently did not\r\nbelong there. For it was bright blue!\r\n\r\nOn the instant I recognized it as the ornament worn by Lady Wimpole at\r\nthe Casino in Monte Carlo!\r\n\r\nA second later I was rushing pell-mell back to camp to rouse Ab-Domen\r\nand make preparations for pursuing the rapidly vanishing whiffle-hens.\r\n\r\nFortunately my faithful dragoman had had the foresight to include in\r\nthe caravan a number of fleet Arabian steeds for just this sort of\r\nsudden foray or side-excursion. I selected Whinney as my companion and\r\nwe were soon mounted in the deep, Moroccan saddles, bits and bridles\r\njingling with bells, burnouses flapping and long guns projecting\r\nat dangerous angles. The animals were frantic to be off, rearing,\r\nsnorting, glaring with blood-shot eyes and blowing foam over the grooms\r\nwho clung on madly like hounds at a fox\xe2\x80\x99s throat until I gave the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Marasa!_\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cCast off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOff we flew like arrows. It would have been more impressive had we both\r\ngone in the same direction. As it was the effect was somewhat scattered\r\nand it was ten minutes before Whinney and I re-convened two miles from\r\nthe encampment and were able to lay a course in the supposed direction\r\nof the birds. Our brutes had now calmed down but were still mettlesome\r\nand we seemed to fly over the sandy floor, eagerly scanning the\r\nhorizon. Fortune favored us. The flock had stopped to feed among some\r\nlow-growing ground-aloes and we came on them suddenly in a fold of the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nReining up I motioned Whinney to move with caution. We must rouse but\r\nnot frighten them if we hoped to keep within range. Cupping my hands I\r\ngave a close approximation of the cry of the African whimbrell, a small\r\nbut savage bird which is the bane of the whiffle-hen whom it pesters by\r\nsudden, unexpected attacks. The flock moved on at once looking about\r\nand paying no attention to us as long as we remained at a distance.\r\n\r\nThus we proceeded for the better part of the morning. The sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheat was becoming dangerous. According to all laws of desert travel\r\nwe should have been safely sheltered in our tents but I kept on\r\nobstinately. My theory was this; whiffle-hens, owing to the value of\r\ntheir plumage, are often caught, corralled and domesticated as is the\r\nostrich. That this was the case with the birds we were following was\r\nevident from the presence among them of Lady Wimpole\xe2\x80\x99s blue feather.\r\nThey might well have been part of her caravan, have broken bounds and\r\nlaunched out for themselves. On then, ever on! Fortune favors the\r\nobstinate!\r\n\r\nAs if to corroborate my thought, things began to happen. The\r\nwhiffle-hens suddenly stopped in their tracks and stood peering\r\nforward. By moving to one side I noticed what their mass had concealed,\r\nnamely a few palm trees and tents at no great distance, the occupants\r\nof which had apparently seen the birds approaching. To one side was a\r\ntemporary corral, its gate invitingly open.\r\n\r\nSensing the psychological moment I gave the word to Whinney and with a\r\nloud cry we sped forward. The whiffle-hens caught by this unexpected\r\nonslaught dashed onward, instinctively rushing into their old quarters\r\noutside of which we drew rein, to be praised, congratulated and\r\nwondered at by the desert patriarch who had given up his precious\r\ncreatures as lost. Bending low he ground his face in the earth, raising\r\nhis head only to blow out small clouds of sand--for he was of that odd\r\nsect, the _Ismilli_ or sand-blowers--mixed with a volley of laudatory\r\nexpletives.\r\n\r\nIt was unmistakably the Wimpoles\xe2\x80\x99 caravan. Hampers, hold-alls,\r\nEnglish-tents and impedimenta were everywhere in evidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they, the Lords of your destiny?\xe2\x80\x9d I questioned.\r\n\r\nThe old hen-shepherd blew out a final cloudlet of sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder is their dwelling: the silken tent neath the third palm. They\r\nare but just now risen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDismounting and throwing my reins to the native I strode off in the\r\ndirection indicated. As I drew near the tent I paused.\r\n\r\nVoices were raised in altercation. Far be it from me to be\r\neaves-dropper to a private family-quarrel, which, alas, I feared was an\r\nall too frequent occurrence in the lives of this mismated pair. Ready\r\nto withdraw I hesitated when a particularly sharp interchange forced\r\na decision. A burst of laughter was followed by a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice crying\r\nhoarsely--\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your throat!\xe2\x80\x9d Then a shriek rang out. It\r\nwas high time to interfere. A fight may be private but a murder is not.\r\nDrawing aside the curtain I leapt into the tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cStay thy hand: infidel son of a swineherd\xe2\x80\x99s sister;\r\nor by the beard of the Prophet thou perish\xe2\x80\x99st.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speech was entirely impromptu and I thought it sounded well, but\r\nsomehow it fell flat.\r\n\r\nLord Wimpole was alone. He was shaving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was speakin\xe2\x80\x99 to that dam\xe2\x80\x99 parrot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said brandishing his razor\r\ntoward Selim who was twisting about and making a noise like sick\r\nautomobile-gears. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow low the fellow was! ... and how contemptible he looked, his face\r\nhalf shaved, half lumpy with lather. One of life\xe2\x80\x99s bitter jokes is that\r\npractically every man must shave. As I thus philosophized the curtains\r\nof an adjoining apartment opened and She appeared.\r\n\r\nHeavens! how beautiful she looked. She _en dishabille_, clutching about\r\nher golden body the folds of a dazzling silk kimono, purple shot with\r\ngreen. Her hair was down: being bobbed it was, of course, always down,\r\nand her blue eyes were filmy with sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor....\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\nI checked her with an imperious gesture in which was expressed the\r\nboundless freedom of the fiery Arab race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEl Sheik Abdullah-el-Dhub ak Moplah,\xe2\x80\x9d I announced.\r\n\r\nLord Wimpole was plainly impressed. Hastily finishing his left cheek he\r\nextended his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Oly mackerel ... a real Sheik. Put\xe2\x80\x99er there. I\xe2\x80\x99m a lord meself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIgnoring his effusion I spoke solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeagues have I ridden, I and my faithful follower, tracing the flight\r\nof birds, yea, even of the swift-skimming whiffle-hens, which ever drew\r\nnearer to their home even as my falcon-heart drew nearer to its nest,\r\nthe tent of the most beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI glanced at Lady Sarah who never batted an eye though one lovely lid\r\ndrooped ever so slightly. Continuing I said, in part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, the journey done, I am a-weary and would fain repose myself\r\nin the light of the gazelle\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. My charger rests neath the nodding\r\nfig-tree and my soul is parched and a-thirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a craftily contrived bit. Wimpole gaped through most of it but\r\ngot the final word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirst\xe2\x80\x9d ... he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cGad, I should say so. Me too. Jolly good idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment later, her ladyship having retired, Wimpole, Whinney and\r\nI raised tall beakers of superb Scotch to my heartfelt toast, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nloveliest lady in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWould she hear me? I wondered. A husky voice from behind the curtain\r\nanswered my hope:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLads, pass one in to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_Love and Lions_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon, it appeared, was to be given over to a lion hunt in\r\nspite of the objections of Effendi-Bazam, the _Karawan-bashi_ or leader\r\nof the Wimpole party which, by the way, was as ill-organized and\r\namateur an outfit as I have ever seen. We were now not far from the\r\nsouthern edge of the Ahaggar Plateau which thrusts its spurs into the\r\ndesert like the stony fingers of a giant hand clutching at the sands.\r\nThe ravines between the fingers were an ideal lurking place for desert\r\nlions, mangy, ill-favored beasts but far more sporty than their South\r\nAfrican brothers.\r\n\r\nEffendi-Bazam was an undersized ottoman, hardly higher than a\r\nfoot-stool. He was thoroughly desert-broken but as timorous as a hare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat danger!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, pointing northward when the hunting\r\nexpedition was proposed. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanger from what ... the lions?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DESERT DIANA\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe afternoon, it appeared, was to be given over to lion-hunting.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Desert Diana]\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and I saw a convulsive swallow traverse the length of\r\nhis triplicate chins. Then he motioned me aside, out of ear-shot of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot lions,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut worse ... a madder, wilder beast. O,\r\nlisten, I pray, important Sheik el-Dhub, listen and heed. We are in the\r\nland of Azad,--Azad the Terrible. In yonder defiles he lurks and who so\r\nventures therein is defiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should mention in passing that there was no suspicion of a pun in\r\nEffendi\xe2\x80\x99s original statement which was delivered in the Astrachan\r\ndialect: the horrid thing is unavoidable in an honest translation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAzad!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,--\xe2\x80\x9cyou have heard of him? Murder, blood, rapine\r\n... they are but beads on his rosary. O, magnificent Moplah, I fear for\r\nour lives ... for our lady. _Ai! Ai!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lay grovelling at my feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Effendi,\xe2\x80\x9d I ordered. \xe2\x80\x9cDue caution will be exercised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout understanding my words he departed, comforted.\r\n\r\nAzad! small wonder that at the mention of his name my face had assumed\r\nits sternest, cruellest expression, for it is a name which is almost\r\nunspeakable in the mouth of any self-respecting desert denizen. In\r\nevery story of the desert which I have studied there is one Sheik who\r\nis described as the cruellest man in the world. To put the matter\r\narithmetically, these men added together equal one-half of Azad. That\r\nis how wicked he was.\r\n\r\nHe was said to be the son of a Spanish murderer who, having escaped\r\nfrom the _bastilliano_ at Cadiz, lived for a time with a gypsy woman of\r\nunknown origin. Azad was the result. From his earliest years he was an\r\noutlaw and defy-er of authority. Swaggering, brawling, killing, making\r\nlove, he roamed from one Mediterranean port to another, gathering\r\nabout him a following of riff-raff and ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-wells. Then came his\r\nnotorious abduction of Miss Sedley from the mission station at Fez.\r\nThis outrage assumed international proportions. Our government, after a\r\nsharp interchange of notes with France, proposed a punitive expedition.\r\nTwo months later President Felix Faure was assassinated. Then rumors\r\nbegan to leak out that Miss Sedley did not wish to be rescued and the\r\naffair was dropped.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the name of Azad became a synonym for unbridled\r\nlicense. Many a time I have heard the fishermen along the Moroccan\r\ncoast say, as the thunder rolled among the coast-ranges. \xe2\x80\x9cAha; there is\r\nold Azad, laughing at the law!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf we were near Azad we were near violence, that was certain, but you\r\nmay be sure I said nothing of this to the others since there was naught\r\nto be gained by alarming them. I had another and better plan. I must\r\ndivert them from their proposed expedition into the hills.\r\n\r\nAbout four in the afternoon when the sun was beginning to lose its\r\nviolence the horses were saddled and the gun-bearers gathered under the\r\npalm trees, Effendi meanwhile becoming more and more anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilady,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, addressing Lady Sarah who had just come out of her\r\ndressing tent, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever hunted desert lions before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we\xe2\x80\x99d no luck. Not so much as a\r\nwhisker did we see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Lord Wimpole. \xe2\x80\x9cEffendi stuck about\r\nthe edges of the hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious ...\xe2\x80\x9d I mused, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you saw no lions ... for there are plenty\r\nof them there ... and yet....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWot are you drivin\xe2\x80\x99 at?\xe2\x80\x9d blustered Wimpole. \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we of seen \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nif they\xe2\x80\x99d been there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was just what I wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot necessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d then, as if the thought had just occurred to me. \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\njove; this is an ideal place for netting lions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth Lord and Lady Wimpole were instantly intrigued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ho?\xe2\x80\x9d they cried simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the idea,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained. \xe2\x80\x9cOver there is typical lion country,\r\nnothing there but sand and lions. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t see them; nature\r\ntakes care of that, you know, protective coloration. Tawny, yellowish\r\nbeasts--they\xe2\x80\x99re invisible at ten feet. But they can be caught. How many\r\ncamels have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-two\xe2\x80\x9d supplied Effendi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Take all the nets that go over their loads and fasten them\r\ntogether. Quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as the Sheik says,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Wimpole.\r\n\r\nAn hour later we were ready, the camel nets in a huge ball being rolled\r\neasily over the desert. About three miles distant I had noted a rocky\r\nflume which narrowed at its lower end. It was ideal for my purpose.\r\nSpreading the nets below I ran a strong camels-hair rope through the\r\nouter edges making a gathering string which was then carried up and\r\nover the projecting rock. At my direction a score or more of _doolahs_\r\nbegan prodding the high bank of sand that rose between the rock-walls\r\nof the gorge. First in a slow trickle, then in a steady stream the sand\r\nslid down into the nets. Occasionally a large mass would fall in which\r\nI thought I detected a flurried motion but, from our distance, I could\r\nnot be sure. When the sand had piled itself to a height of about twelve\r\nfeet, the base of the symmetrical cone reaching to the edge of the nets\r\nI gave a word of command, \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d and the _doolah_-boys began pulling\r\nhastily at the gathering-rope. The edge of the nets rose neatly,\r\nclosing-in around the top of the cone. Phase one of my operation was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nNext came the final and exciting step of freeing the nets of sand. This\r\nwas accomplished by yawing the gathering-rope violently from side to\r\nside until the net was sufficiently loosened to allow its being dragged\r\nacross the desert floor. Twice, thrice the sturdy _doolahs_ hurled\r\ntheir bulks on the rope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe starts ... she moves!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Whinney.\r\n\r\nOnce in motion, the sand spun rapidly through the meshes until it was\r\nreduced to a small mass in the center of which I could detect two\r\nvague, but furiously revolving forms ... lions!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpearmen, ready!\xe2\x80\x9d I commanded, for it does not do to be unprepared.\r\n\r\nLord Wimpole, express-rifle in hand, was apoplectic with excitement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo we shoot \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... no!\xe2\x80\x9d I motioned him back. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will kill each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSure enough, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 fearful clawing and growling the\r\nfierce struggle amid the strong meshes quieted down. Two precautionary\r\nshots into the net, and the battle was over. At our feet lay the\r\nmangled remains of two tawny lions, exactly matching the shade of the\r\nsurrounding sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor milady\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d I said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my own country we do it\r\nwith a sieve; it is much simpler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Straordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Wimpole giving me a meaning look from her\r\nbrilliant eyes, and we made our way back toward the camp voting the\r\naffair a complete success.\r\n\r\nWe dined in state in the Wimpoles\xe2\x80\x99 dining-tent. It was a lucullan\r\nrepast of European delicacies varied with African dishes superbly\r\ncooked by a French chef; hors d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvres, a delicious thin soup, audad\r\nsteak and Egyptian quail succeeded each other, each course being marked\r\nby its appropriate wine from sherry through the whites and reds to\r\ncognac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any champagne\xe2\x80\x9d; apologized Lord Wimpole through a\r\nmouthful of quail, \xe2\x80\x9ctried to but it blew up. No ice in the dam\xe2\x80\x99 desert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Sarah looked on coldly as her husband passed through the familiar\r\nphrases of garrulity, incoherence and speechlessness. She rose\r\ndisdainfully just as his lordship slipped heavily from his camp chair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak to your ladyship a moment ... alone.\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEffendi, remove his lordship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed her out under the cool stars, whispering to Whinney as I\r\npassed, \xe2\x80\x9cGet the horses ready, we must away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the oasis Lady Sarah paused and faced me. We were\r\nalone--at last! Overhead a million eyes looked down from the twinkling\r\ngallery of heaven; far to the west a gibbous moon shone palely; night\r\nenveloped us--in fact it was going on midnight. Clearing my throat I\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO woman, strange and mysterious, lamp of my life, it is not for me to\r\nrend the veil of thy secrecy, but my soul is eager in its questioning\r\nand my heart cries for an answer. Tell me, if thou so will\xe2\x80\x99st, why\r\ndid\xe2\x80\x99st thou fly from thy nest when thou had\xe2\x80\x99st made tryst with me at\r\nthe police-station?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo my delight she caught the elevation of my style at once and replied\r\nunhesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, O desert-man, Sheik Adullah-el-Dhub, and let thy heart attend,\r\nfor oft has my own voice upbraided me that I did thus walk out on thee.\r\nKnow then that it was not my will but that of the Sheik Wimpole, my\r\nover-lord, that hurried me hither-ward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough I winced at the reference to her over-lord I could but admire\r\nher fluent mastery of the nomadic tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwho plucked me from thy side, fearing the\r\nlong delays of the law. But thou gottest my message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, Princess--\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, at which she smiled, pleased evidently,\r\nat the promotion,--\xe2\x80\x9cYea, even so,--and thy signal plume likewise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas well contrived the matter of the whiffle-hens. Trust thy woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas simple,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were in the keeping of Kashgi, the\r\nsand-blower, an ancient stupid. Under guise of petting the bell hen\r\nI affixed my feather. Something told me they would find you, O Great\r\nSouth-wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer words moved me deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight as the thrown lance or the sped arrow,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, feeling that\r\nthe moment for tender mastery had come, \xe2\x80\x9cso came thy harbinger to me, O\r\nwoman of bronze and gold. Allah be praised, whose hand hath guided me\r\nsince that first fair evening when at the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s edge I marvelled at\r\nthy sky-line!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down at me, for she was slightly taller than I--tenderly,\r\nher rugged contours softened and beautified in the silver light. It was\r\nlike moonlight on a cliff. My heart pounded furiously--her presence,\r\nthe silence of the desert ... the cognac.... I was fired by emotion.\r\nDrawing myself up to her full height I stretched out my arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Woman----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the instant I paused, thunderstruck. Far away on the northern\r\nhorizon a light gleamed for a moment and was gone. Was it fact or fancy\r\nthat made me think I saw a vague shape in the shadows before me.\r\nInstantly the thought of Azad flashed through my mind and brought me to\r\nmy senses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALONE AT LAST\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was fired by emotion. Drawing myself up to her full height I\r\nstretched out my arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, woman....\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alone at Last]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d I said hurriedly--\xe2\x80\x9cI must defer what I was going to\r\nsay until another time. I was forgetting what made me ask for this\r\ninterview--the night--your beauty--but the point is this. You, we, all\r\nof us are in imminent danger. On the hills yonder lies the camp of Azad\r\nthe Terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see her pale in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven now his spies are probably prowling about, watching your camp,\r\ncounting your men, your camels, your--women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you suggest?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked tremulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlight--\xe2\x80\x9d I replied boldly.\r\n\r\nHer glance expressed both surprise and disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated harshly, \xe2\x80\x9cflight! I have never been afraid to be\r\ncautious. Listen, Lady Sarah. Your caravan is ill-equipped. Effendi\r\nis strong on commissary but weak on munitions. There is but one thing\r\nto be done. We must consolidate. Azad will not attack tonight; he\r\nknows I am here. At dawn strike camp and remove to the Southward.\r\nIn the meantime I will speed to my own men and summon them to your\r\nassistance. There is not a moment to be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHastily retracing our steps we reached the camp where, at the portal of\r\nthe luxurious tent, I bent over Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s hand, lightly brushing her\r\nfirm knuckles with my lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d I breathed. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, strike camp at dawn. Be of good\r\nheart--and do not forget--the Sheik Abdullah-el-Dhub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, smiling strangely.\r\n\r\nAs she lifted the tent curtain I had a glimpse of the elaborate\r\ninterior, hung with silken draperies and furnished with many-hued\r\ncushions and a broad low divan over the edge of which, upside down,\r\nhung the brutish face of Sir Horace Wimpole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer over-lord!\xe2\x80\x9d----\r\n\r\nUgh! A shudder of revulsion shook me.\r\n\r\nA moment later Whinney and I were rushing through the night like great\r\nwhite birds while in my heart echoed the words of an old Persian love\r\nsong--\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, farewell, my sweet gazelle,\r\n  With ruby eyes----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_A Desperate Predicament_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhinney and I were facing a difficult task, a hard ride at night just\r\nwhen we should have been going to bed. This meant little to me for I\r\nhave frequently gone two and three nights without sleep but it was\r\ntorture to my companion who is that most pathetic of human beings, a\r\ncreature of regular habits. Twice, as we plodded along, he lunged from\r\nhis saddle and as I lifted him he kept murmuring \xe2\x80\x9cMust have my eight\r\nhours ... must have my eight hours.\xe2\x80\x9d All efforts to keep him awake were\r\nin vain and I began to despair of ever reaching our destination until\r\nI hit on the idea of fastening my burnous between our horses forming a\r\ncradle into which my friend fell with a pleased smile and the drowsy\r\ncomment \xe2\x80\x9cMake up lower seven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn, on we sped at a smooth, steady pace. Now and again the horses would\r\nseparate to avoid a thorny squill-bush and Whinney would be tossed\r\nlightly in his blanket; but he slept soundly through it all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REGINALD WHINNEY\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat most pathetic of human beings, a creature of regular habits.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reginald Whinney]\r\n\r\nI was glad to be alone, alone with my fears, my anxieties and my great\r\nlove, for that Lady Sarah felt the force of my flaming passion I could\r\nnot doubt. Had she not called me to her side? Had she not looked into\r\nmy eyes that very evening with an expression which might have led me\r\nto the gates of Paradise, had I not been interrupted by Azad\xe2\x80\x99s signal\r\nflash?\r\n\r\nAzad! The thought of him was a knife in my heart. \xe2\x80\x9cOn, Thunderer, on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI urged my willing horse, patting his wet neck and shoulder. Then moved\r\nby a sentimental desire for a confidant I leaned forward. The brute\r\nseemed to understand for he bent back an attentive ear. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is for\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered. Thunderer whirled instantly and Whinney was thrown\r\nfar into the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot _to_ her ... _for_ her, you idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d I ground out, savagely tugging\r\nat the reins and forcing my brace of beasts back toward our passenger.\r\nBut though we were soon under way again the horses were now restive and\r\ndifficult to manage.\r\n\r\nI had been steering a course by the stars, aiming at a particularly\r\nlarge, red one which looked familiar and which, Whinney agreed, had\r\nbeen directly over our camp. But there must have been something wrong\r\nwith my calculations. Most Sheiks steer entirely by the heavenly bodies\r\nbut I had hardly had time to get the hang of them.\r\n\r\nThe sky was fading to a delicate beryl-green when I decided to let the\r\nhorses have their own way. As I loosed my rein they turned gracefully\r\nat a right angle and broke into an encouraging gallop. Soon the heavens\r\nwere flooded with the invading light, the stars paled and the sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrays shot across the desert. With the sun just peering over the horizon\r\nevery stunted shrub cast a long blue shadow, every shallow depression\r\nbecame a pool of liquid purple into which Thunderer and his fellow\r\nrushed, loose-reined.\r\n\r\nWe must have ridden a dozen miles out of our way following the red\r\nstar line and I was beginning to wonder if the intelligence of the\r\nArab horses was all that it was said to be, when I detected a distant\r\nsomething on the horizon. It was still too far off for identification\r\nbut I scanned it eagerly. A quarter hour passed and I could clearly\r\nmake out an oasis and beneath it tents--our tents!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime to get up,\xe2\x80\x9d I yelled, bringing the two horses close together,\r\nthus squeezing Whinney\xe2\x80\x99s head gently between their bellies, causing\r\nhim to open his eyes in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we are,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up, man; climb into your saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clumsily obeyed my injunction and having freed my burnous, I gave\r\nThunderer his head and dashed forward, glad to be temporarily rid of my\r\nsleepy companion. As I flashed by I had a glimpse of Whinney checking\r\nhis horse and stopping to wipe the sleep from his eyes. Little did I\r\nrealize it at the time but my leaving him at that moment was to be\r\none of the determining events of my life, an event without which that\r\nlife would inevitably have been lost and this story, horrible to think\r\nof!--never written.\r\n\r\nThunderer and I covered the last quarter mile in record time, jumped a\r\nseries of tent-ropes and recumbent camels and bounded into the center\r\nof a somnolent compound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo arms! To arms!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted, brandishing my own. \xe2\x80\x9cYour queen is in\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x9d Unconsciously I quoted the beautiful lines from the Black\r\nCrook, probably the most exquisite lyric drama in the English language.\r\nAt my words startled Arabs popped from the encircling tents or raised\r\nthemselves from the masses of baggage upon which they had been\r\nsleeping. In a moment I was closely hemmed in by a circle of swart,\r\nsavage faces. \xe2\x80\x9cHeavens,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9chow could Ab-Domen have recruited\r\nsuch tough travelling companions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, raising my hands, I addressed them, speaking boldly, fiercely,\r\ntalking down to them as it were in order to let them know their place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearken, O, Scum of the Sahara, and hear the words of your master,\r\nAbdullah-el-Dhub....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter and a mighty cry of \xe2\x80\x9cYaa ... a ... ah\xe2\x80\x9d greeted\r\nmy ears and with a sickening sense of defeat I realized that I was\r\nsurrounded by enemies. I might have known! The men were of a different\r\ntype from any of my camp-followers. My Arabs were swart but these were\r\nswarter. I instinctively looked over their heads to warn Whinney of my\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cBack,--I am captured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I might have saved my breath. The plucky fellow was already a\r\nspeck on the horizon having fled the instant he saw and heard what was\r\ntranspiring. There was only one desperate chance left; to jump the\r\nencircling crowd. Spurring Thunderer with both heels, I gave him a\r\nloose rein. Gathering himself together he made a glorious leap from a\r\nstanding position high over the head of the tallest Arab. For a second\r\nI thought I had broken through when, straight and sure, rose a native\r\nspear hurled by a gigantic Bassikunu. It struck my courageous beast\r\ndirectly below me and with a scream of anguish he fell on the stout\r\nshaft, the point being forced upward through bone, sinew, entrails,\r\nsaddle-blanket and saddle. Only the greatest nimbleness on my part\r\nsaved me from a fatal puncture.\r\n\r\nLike a soaring bird I leaped from the saddle, my burnous floating in\r\nbillows about me as I planed earthward there to be seized by a hundred\r\nhands, disarmed, my hands trussed behind me, my feet bound in morocco\r\nleather and my head covered with a filthy gunny-sack.\r\n\r\nAbout me I heard coarse laughter and an occasional remark in the crude\r\nBassikunu dialect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d said one, kicking me contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cthis will be a pleasant\r\nsurprise for Azad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo? I was in _his_ hands. O, the bitterness of my reflection that Azad,\r\nthe cruellest of men, held me thus in his power, and that far from\r\nhaving captured me I, Traprock, had deliberately ridden into his arms.\r\nThe humiliation, the ignominy of it. By a desperate movement I managed\r\nto struggle to my feet.\r\n\r\nBound as I was, with my head covered I must have presented the\r\nappearance of a contestant in some grotesque gymkhana event. After a\r\nfew convulsive leaps I fell heavily, landing in the live embers of the\r\ncook\xe2\x80\x99s fire over which hung a kettle of some nauseous brew which I\r\npromptly upset in my spasmodic efforts to escape the burning brands;\r\nall this to the accompaniment of uproarious laughter.\r\n\r\nRolling over in one final wriggle I felt something hard under my\r\nhands back of me. My grasp tightened on it by instinct as I lost\r\nconsciousness from faintness and suffocation. I knew vaguely that I was\r\nbeing lifted by two men after which I was thrown down heavily; then\r\nblackness closed about me. Matters were not looking their best.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy first impressions of Azad were gained from his voice. He had\r\nreturned to his camp during my fainting spell and stood not far from\r\nthe spot where I had been thrown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, did you get the women?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one of his followers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBy her side was a mighty Sheik--a Moplah--so my spy\r\ntells me, a man of great strength and cunning. I resolved to bide my\r\ntime. Tonight she will be alone with her half-witted husband and her\r\nidiot of a Karawan-bashi and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say a Moplah chief was with her?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned an unfortunate\r\nfollower who had not learned the penalty of speaking out of turn in a\r\nconversation with Azad; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy this very day....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got no further. Azad gave an almost inaudible command at which the\r\ninterrupting voice suddenly thinned to a wheeze as if the wind-pipe had\r\nbeen closed by violent pressure. A convulsive gurgling sob was followed\r\nby a low moan and I felt the impact of a body falling heavily on the\r\nsand near me.\r\n\r\nThough I could see nothing I must confess that Azad\xe2\x80\x99s voice was the\r\nmost unpleasant I have ever heard. Far from being harsh and dominating\r\nit was low, cool, almost tired. It faded away at the end of sentences\r\nas if the possessor had withdrawn himself from human contact. I sensed\r\nthe presence of one to whom human life, even his own--was nothing. If a\r\nsnake had a voice I feel sure it would be the voice of Azad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the fellow saying?\xe2\x80\x9d asked those icy tones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AZAD THE TERRIBLE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a snake had a voice I feel sure it would be the voice of Azad.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Azad the Terrible]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we have this day captured a Moplah chief, O Sire,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nhumble reply, \xe2\x80\x9ceven now he lies nearby in the shelter of thy tent where\r\nhe awaits thy pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProduce,\xe2\x80\x9d said Azad.\r\n\r\nI was lifted and borne into a brighter light. An instant later the sack\r\nwas pulled from my head. It was a critical moment; now, if ever, was\r\nthe time for dissimulation. I must pretend that my fainting fit still\r\nendured; upon that depended my life. Even a man as unspeakably cruel as\r\nAzad finds no satisfaction in torturing an unconscious enemy. There is\r\nno pleasure in it.\r\n\r\nI was not mistaken. After a brief inspecting during which I scarcely\r\nbreathed I was again flung into the shadows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of Azad,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhen he comes to we will....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can not repeat his proposed line of action but the mere mention of it\r\nnearly produced a real swoon.\r\n\r\nFor an hour I lay motionless, thinking, thinking, the thought drumming\r\nin my brain,--\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I get out of this mess?\xe2\x80\x9d About me the sounds\r\nof the camp gradually quieted. The heat grew intense and I knew that\r\nit was the middle of the day, the time of the siesta. And then again I\r\nbecame conscious of the object which I had clutched when I was first\r\nthrown on the ground. Turning it over in my bound hands I realized\r\nthat it was a knife, evidently one of the cook\xe2\x80\x99s utensils which I had\r\nknocked over. To cut the bonds back of me was difficult but I finally\r\nmanaged it by lying on the edge of the knife. One by one I felt the\r\nthongs part though I injured myself severely in the process for as each\r\nstrand of leather gave way the blade sank in my flesh and the sand was\r\nreddened about me.\r\n\r\nFaint but desperate I realized that I must act quickly in the brief\r\ninterval offered to me. Freeing my feet I cautiously lifted my burlap\r\nveil and peered about. I lay near the entrance of Azad\xe2\x80\x99s tent in the\r\nrecesses of which I could see his body sunk in deep slumber, guarded by\r\na drowsy slave. Just beyond the outer curtain lay the form of a humble\r\nBassikunu, the unfortunate creature who had interrupted his lord and\r\nmaster. The hem of his dirty brown mantle almost touched that of my\r\nburnous.\r\n\r\nAn open attempt to escape now meant certain death. For one mad moment I\r\nthought of springing to my feet, cleaver in hand, and dispatching the\r\nfilthy Azad with one clean blow. But what was to be gained. The odds\r\nwere too great. Slowly a plan formed in my mind.\r\n\r\nWith the silence of a snake I edged slightly nearer the slain Bassikunu\r\nuntil our garments overlapped. It was the work of an hour which seemed\r\nlike twelve for me to move his corpse out of his coarse garment and\r\ninto the voluminous folds of my cloak. Moving a fraction of an inch at\r\na time, the sweat of excitement pouring from my body, I burrowed and\r\npushed and pulled and hauled until we had at last changed places, the\r\nhumble camel-driver lying inside in my Moplah cloak while I sprawled\r\nbeyond the tent wall in his blood stained and ignoble raiment. A few\r\nfeet from me on the sand lay his tongue, plucked out by the roots, a\r\npretty sample of Azad\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I effected this perilous change of costume when the camp\r\nwas suddenly in an uproar. Into the midst of the compound bounded an\r\nexcited Arab on a foam flecked horse. Azad leaped to alertness with\r\namazing speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, Mulai Hadji,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir caravan approaches!\xe2\x80\x9d said the rider excitedly. For a second I\r\ncherished the thought that my own men were on the way to my rescue\r\nbut this hope died as the speaker continued, \xe2\x80\x9ceven now they are\r\nmoving southward,--their camels rich with plunder, their men few and\r\nill-armed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of the Moplah caravan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Azad who was evidently a man\r\nof caution rather than bravery. I hung on the answer in a fever of\r\nexcitement for I knew it referred to my own expedition. The information\r\nwas delivered with a scornful laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fools! They continue Eastward in search of their lost master.\r\nA day\xe2\x80\x99s journey away they must be nearing the Wells of Tabala. The\r\nfruit is ripe, O Mighty Azad; the golden pomegranate is ready for your\r\nplucking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe golden pomegranate! That could be none other than Sarah, my lovely\r\nbird, flying southward at my behest, straight into the clutches of this\r\nvulture, this ... it was too much. Leaping to my feet I ran toward the\r\ncamel-compound. Happily, in my humble costume, I was unnoticed; I was\r\nsimply a Bassikunu, one more or less. Seizing and mounting the first\r\navailable camel I joined the mob which was surging northward. My one\r\nhope was to detach myself from this filthy band, overtake my own men\r\nand bring them back to the rescue. Cruel as it seemed to desert Lady\r\nSarah at this juncture therein lay the only practical plan. But on a\r\nslow moving camel my task was hopeless. Ahead of me rode one of the\r\nsub-sheiks on a magnificent sorrel mare. What must be done must be done\r\nquickly. For an instant he checked his horse to avoid a tent-rope and\r\nin that instant I acted, urging my clumsy brute forward and riding off\r\nthe Arab, pushing him with all my force against the obstruction until\r\nhorse and rider fell sprawling. Dropping from my camel I was at his\r\nside in a second, pretending to assist him, in doing which I twisted\r\nhis head completely around so that though his breast lay upward his\r\nface was buried in the sand. He fainted without a sound and a moment\r\nlater, wrapped in his great cloak, I sprang into the empty saddle and,\r\ncautiously at first and finally at full speed, rushed off toward the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nThe whole operation took no more than three seconds and could never\r\nhave been accomplished other than by taking advantage of the peculiar\r\nconditions of confusion, etc., and by acting upon what has always been\r\nmy greatest safeguard--instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_The Escape_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nFree! Free once more. With a glorious feeling of elation I bounded\r\noff across the desert. Glancing over my shoulder I saw that I had\r\naccomplished my get-away without attracting attention. Azad\xe2\x80\x99s men\r\nwere streaming steadily northward, a low cloud of dust marking their\r\nprogress. I watched intently for any sign of pursuit but none came.\r\nFrom the unfortunate tribesman who had ridden my mount I feared no\r\nfurther trouble. The strength of my hands is a constant surprise to me\r\nand when I twisted the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s head I had heard something crack with\r\nthe ominous, final snap of a too-tightly wound toy. Unless I was very\r\nmuch mistaken the creature was permanently out of order.\r\n\r\nMy hours of unconsciousness and captivity must have been longer than\r\nI realized for I noted that the day was far spent. This was a source\r\nof comfort to me for hope sprang in my breast that the sun would\r\ndisappear before the treacherous scoundrel I had evaded could come up\r\nwith the Wimpole caravan. Unconsciously I encouraged the orb of day in\r\nhis descent, urging him with prayers and curses to sink as rapidly as\r\npossible. Sheltered by night the cortege of my lady might yet pass a\r\nfew hours in safety, hours fraught with fiendish anxiety for me.\r\n\r\nMy plans for the future hung on a gossamer thread of chance, that of\r\nlocating the Wells of Tabala to which, according to Azad\xe2\x80\x99s informant,\r\nmy faithful Moplahs had repaired. My only indication was the vague one\r\nof direction. The wells lay to the eastward and eastward the star of\r\nTraprock took its way, blindly, desperately. Pray Heaven my men would\r\ngo slowly and cautiously as they might well do considering my absence.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour\xe2\x80\x99s hard riding when all traces of the enemy had faded\r\ninto nothingness I paused and from an inner pocket drew out my map of\r\nthe Sahara. As I feared it was too small in scale to be of definite\r\nadvantage. Imaginary lines such as the Tropic of Cancer, the 20th\r\nParallel and numerous meridians were shown with perfect distinctness.\r\nThese would have served admirably had I been going to an imaginary\r\nplace but the Wells of Tabala were of poignantly definite import and\r\nof them there was no trace. With a sigh of resignation I thrust the\r\ndocument back in its case and took up the reins.\r\n\r\nThese first leagues of my journey were by no means as uneventful as\r\nthey sound. The reader must remember that my horse and I were utter\r\nstrangers to each other. This the mare resented with all the fire\r\nof the most pure-blooded Arabian steed than which no animal is more\r\ndifficult when aroused. With true feminine deceptiveness she concealed\r\nher feeling for a considerable period during which we gathered\r\ntremendous speed. Then suddenly, after a great leap in air, she landed\r\nstiff-legged, stock-still in a cloud of sand. Fortunately I had taken\r\ncare to twist the Bassikunu cloak firmly about the pommel of the saddle\r\nor all had been lost. As it was I flew straight on over the animal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, fetching up with a snap and swinging downward violently at her\r\nfeet. She immediately reared, endeavoring to kill me with her sharp\r\nhoofs. I now hung like a human apron under her foaming muzzle, her eyes\r\nluckily being blinded by the heavy folds. In a trice I threw my arms\r\nabout the thrashing knees, and, quickly slipping my grip down to the\r\nfetlocks, crossed her fore-legs, throwing my full strength against her\r\nshoulder as she fell. With a whimper of defeat the gallant beast rolled\r\nover on her side while I sat comfortably on her head and regained my\r\nbreath, thanking my stars for the years of experience on our western\r\nplains which now stood me in such good stead.\r\n\r\nThen, unwrapping the burnous, I looked long and steadily into the\r\nblood-shot eyes of the animal below me. Gradually the wild gaze\r\nsoftened until with a sigh of resignation the soft lids dropped and\r\nthe tense neck relaxed. As plainly as a horse could the mare said \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsurrender; you are my master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI instantly rose, taking the animal at her word and she stood\r\npeacefully still while I tightened the girths. From then on there was\r\nno more trouble from that quarter.\r\n\r\nIf we had travelled fast before we now fairly flew. The sorrel swung\r\nsteadily on as if to make amends for her past captiousness. By this\r\ntime the sun was below the horizon and purple shadows vast and\r\nthreatening rose from the wastes about me, vague towers and impalpable\r\nwraiths of darkness that loomed and fled. The low voice of the night\r\nwind began its sobbing. Often there would come to my ear the sound of\r\na broken, inarticulate sentence as if some inhuman tongue had babbled\r\na mysterious language: again the gray shape of a jackal glided swiftly\r\nalong the edge of my vision or a desert rat scuttled across my path. As\r\nthe darkness deepened it became peopled with all manner of visionary\r\nterrors and I could readily understand and accept the myriad djinns,\r\nevil spirits and ghosts of the misty East.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, as my heart sank lower, the sorrel suddenly checked her\r\nstride, faltered and came to a full stop. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor brute,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare spent. It is the beginning of the end.\xe2\x80\x9d But as if to contradict\r\nme she thrust out her nose and neighed shrilly, following this by a\r\ncautious advance. Plainly she had detected something of which I was\r\nnot aware. Sure enough, a hundred yards farther on I caught the sound\r\nof low moaning, pitiful but inexpressibly human and comforting in that\r\ndark wilderness. We made our way quickly in the direction of the sound\r\nand were soon rewarded by seeing a vague black form against the desert\r\ngrayness. Hastily dismounting I bent over the object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity ... pity....\xe2\x80\x9d begged a weak voice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZALOOFA\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a Circassian, lured from the convent-school of\r\nsnake-charmers at Timbuctoo.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zaloofa]\r\n\r\nBending lower I saw that the speaker was a woman, young and beautiful,\r\nher pale features haggard to the point of exhaustion. When I had\r\ngiven her a reviving draught from my emergency flask and assured her\r\nof my friendly attitude she outlined her pitiful story. It was another\r\nsample of Azad\xe2\x80\x99s dastardly work. She was a Circassian, lured from the\r\nConvent-school of snake-charmers at Timbuctoo. For a month she had been\r\nthe sheik\xe2\x80\x99s favorite, then cast aside, poisoned as he thought and left\r\nto bleach on the sands. But her constant inoculation with the venom of\r\nher pets had made her practically immune to the deadly toxin and for\r\nthree days she had lain helpless \xe2\x80\x99neath the furious sun, struggling to\r\nreach Tabala.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTabala!\xe2\x80\x9d At the word I sprang up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\r\nquickly. I go but to procure aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not far,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAn hour\xe2\x80\x99s ride, perhaps, under yon\r\nconstellation of El Whizbang.\xe2\x80\x9d And with the words she lapsed into\r\nunconsciousness. Covering her gently with my cloak I leaped into the\r\nsaddle. Bright above me glistened the starry diadem of El Whizbang and\r\nonce more the sorrel and I thundered on through the night, our hearts\r\nalight with courage and hope.\r\n\r\nThe desert woman\xe2\x80\x99s direction was straight and sure. With startling\r\nsuddenness a group of tall palms sprang into being. The neighing of\r\nmy excited mare roused muffled cries, movement, bustle and confusion\r\nas vague tents disgorged their startled inmates. \xe2\x80\x9cSwank! Whinney,\r\nAb-Do-men!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted.\r\n\r\nAnswering shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cTraprock\xe2\x80\x9d pierced the night.\r\n\r\nThere was no time lost in parley. A brief pause for rest, a change of\r\ncostume, a fresh mount and with twenty picked men armed to the teeth I\r\nturned back over a road I was not likely to forget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestward-ho!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted, heading the gallant troop, and we thundered\r\noff to the rescue of all that I held most dear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_Sheik to Sheik_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short interval at our camp I had given Ab-Domen explicit orders\r\nas to just what to do. Twenty of the best tribesmen and all the\r\navailable horses came with me. The men were mostly Moplahs with a few\r\nKadas. They had long roamed the desert and having had much experience\r\nwith tourists, were as rapacious and blood-thirsty a lot as one could\r\nwish. In addition I had Swank and Whinney, trusted and true, with the\r\nexact amount of intelligence necessary to handle the turbulent natives\r\nand no more.\r\n\r\nAb-Domen stayed with the caravan. His instructions were to retrace his\r\nsteps with the outfit which was, of course, slow moving. He was to make\r\none day\xe2\x80\x99s journey after which he was to pitch camp and be prepared to\r\nwelcome us back or dig in and resist to the death should Allah so will.\r\nMy parting with the ponderous dragoman had been unusually affecting and\r\nit was with a stern, set countenance that I headed my impetuous band.\r\n\r\nFor some time we rode in silence. The vault of heaven was still black\r\nat the zenith but at its eastern edge glowed a widening band of\r\nsilver that flickered and ran fitfully about the horizon as the flame\r\nruns around the wick of an oil stove. I never light my four-cylinder\r\nblue-flame without thinking of that momentous hour. Back of us the\r\nstar, El Whizbang, sank to its usual matinal extinction, a faithful and\r\nexemplary planet, having performed its good deed for the night. We soon\r\nreached the crouching form of the Circassian woman with whom I left\r\nsupplies, a loaf of bread, a goatskin of camels-milk and several of the\r\nlatest magazines and whose location I marked for Ab-Domen\xe2\x80\x99s guidance\r\nwith a small red flag mounted on a spear. Thus we left her, looking\r\nlike the eighteenth green of a desert golf course.\r\n\r\nIn the growing light the trained eyes of my Moplahs easily followed\r\nthe vague tracks of my previous ride. No wind had risen to disturb the\r\nshifting sands and though invisible to me their practised vision easily\r\npicked up the trail. They were much puzzled when we reached the site\r\nof my struggle with the sorrel where the deep hoof marks and trampled\r\nsand were plain to all. \xe2\x80\x9cYou fell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ouidja, a cadaverous Kada.\r\nI laughed at the idea and shortly narrated the incident to their\r\ngreat delight, and ejaculations of \xe2\x80\x9c_Bishmillah!_\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Biskra!_\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Wahully!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDay now streamed lucidly over the undulating plain but though the\r\ntension of the previous hours was somewhat relaxed by action the\r\nincreasing light brought to me an increase of anxiety. By now Azad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncamp would be astir. At this very moment the attack might be beginning\r\nif--alas! it had not already ended. This despairful thought prompted an\r\nattempt on my part to shorten the distance between us.\r\n\r\nBetween our present position and the original site of Azad\xe2\x80\x99s camp\r\nlay an hour\xe2\x80\x99s hard riding. From that point he had gone north while\r\nmy course had been east. We had been describing two sides of a right\r\nangle. Obviously the intelligent thing to do was to close the triangle\r\nand take the shortest possible route along its hypotenuse. \xe2\x80\x9cHalt!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nordered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RESCUE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuperb! you are like a swift-running tide-race foaming over a hidden\r\nreef.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Rescue]\r\n\r\nHastily dismounting I drew an accurate diagram on the desert, which\r\nis ideally adapted for geometric study. All my life long I have clung\r\nto the knowledge that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the\r\nsum of the squares of the other two sides. It stood me in good stead\r\nnow. Quickly figuring the approximate distance which Azad and I\r\nmust have travelled I leaped into the saddle with a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cQ.E.D.\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nthe mystification of my followers. From now on I was leader indeed.\r\nAccording to my figures and time allowance the distance to be travelled\r\nshould be about nineteen miles which, with our superb animals, we could\r\nexpect to travel in a little more than an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cPray Heaven Euclid was\r\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured.\r\n\r\nThe sun had cleared the horizon and struck brightly on our flowing\r\ncloaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a wonderful sight!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Swank, who had ridden off at a\r\ndistance to take a photograph. \xe2\x80\x9cSuperb! You are like a swift-running\r\ntide-race foaming over a hidden reef!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I was oblivious to his poetic similes for, far off but dead ahead,\r\nI seemed to see an answering gleam of white and a faint dusty blur on\r\nthe horizon. My heart stood still as my horse bounded forward more\r\nswiftly than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted hoarsely. The others caught the infection of my\r\nexcitement and we thundered onward.\r\n\r\nYes! ... it was Azad and his assassins!\r\n\r\nAfter an interminable half-hour we could see them plainly. The attack\r\nwas on in all its fury. Very evidently Azad\xe2\x80\x99s men had seen our\r\napproach, even as we had detected them, and had thrown themselves on\r\ntheir quarry with the idea of having that part of the job done with\r\nbefore we could come up. But they had reckoned without the intelligence\r\nand courage of Lady Wimpole and the brute obstinacy of her husband.\r\nWimpole, it appeared later, the instant he suspected the hostile\r\nintentions of Azad\xe2\x80\x99s party, had formed his group into a British square\r\nwhich he considered absolutely unbreakable.\r\n\r\nWe could see the huddled formation in the center with the encircling\r\ncordon of Bassikunus galloping about it. The sight of a merry-go-round\r\ninvariably brings back that tragic picture. Soon we heard the fierce\r\ncries of \xe2\x80\x9c_Blida! Laghouat blida!_\xe2\x80\x9d a Bassikunu form of unprintable\r\ntorture which clearly accounted for the desperate resistance of Effendi\r\nand his men. Poor Effendi! I had feared he would give up at the first\r\nshot, but I did him an injustice.\r\n\r\nNow we were only a half-mile away but O, what dire things can happen in\r\na half-mile. How I cursed the desert for its magnificent distances as\r\nI urged my horse forward. An occasional shot, a scream, an imprecation\r\nnow mingled with the rising dust. At intervals twos and threes of\r\nthe attacking party broke from the circle, darted forward and plucked\r\nsome screeching fragment from the human wall. A camel dashed by me,\r\nbellowing piteously, the upper third of his hump cut cleanly off by\r\nsome terrific sabre-swing which gave him the singular look of a table\r\ntopped mountain. Brick by brick, stone by stone, life by life, the\r\nliving parapet was being torn away.\r\n\r\nNow in the center I could see the little group of defenders, smoking\r\nrevolvers in hand, Effendi-Bazam crouching low, praying and firing\r\nsimultaneously, Lord Wimpole, white as paper, Lady Sarah--my Sarah!\r\nredder than ever; a flaming beacon of courage, her bottle-green veil\r\nflying behind her and her eyes snapping behind her dark-blue glasses.\r\nHorrors! The square had crumbled!--the wall was down.\r\n\r\nWith a loud cry of \xe2\x80\x9c_Blida!_\xe2\x80\x9d the desert-scum rose like a tidal-wave\r\novercoming the gallant group in a final heart-rending crash. A cloud of\r\ndust, pierced by wails of agony, obscured the ghastly details of the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nAt times like this one does not think clearly; one acts. It was so\r\nin this instance. Without a word being spoken Swank and Whinney\r\nranged themselves on either side of me, my Moplahs forming a\r\ndense triangle at our backs. The enemy had instantly whirled about\r\npresenting everywhere a front bristling with guns, lances and gleaming\r\n_simlas_--the long, curved desert-swords. With increasing speed we\r\nhurled ourselves at the mass. Representing as I did what efficiency\r\nexperts call the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint of contact\xe2\x80\x9d my position was one of extreme\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nLet me but dispose of the first man! He was a gigantic fellow with\r\na gun approximately twelve feet long pointed directly at me. As he\r\npressed his finger to the trigger my automatic barked and he crumpled\r\nup with a blue-edged hole in his forehead. The next instant our\r\ncrushing wedge split Azad\xe2\x80\x99s warriors into fragments. In that first\r\nmoment of terrific impact Swank and Whinney stood by me nobly. Only men\r\ntrained in the rush-hour tactics of civilized subways could have come\r\nthrough alive.\r\n\r\nWith the first penetration accomplished it was a case of hand to hand\r\nfighting. Everywhere were struggling knots of humanity, swaying,\r\nplunging, stabbing, slicing ... it was hell let loose. A single thought\r\nin mind, I searched frantically for Lady Sarah. She was nowhere to be\r\nseen. Weaving my way between sprawling groups I fought toward the edge\r\nof the battle. Then I saw the devilish Azad\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, for at a distance\r\nof a hundred yards were two horsemen, a muffled figure between them,\r\ngalloping furiously to the southward. Crafty villain! under cover of\r\nthe fighting his idea was to escape.\r\n\r\nFree of all obstacles I sped after them, rapidly gaining on their\r\nencumbered progress. It was two to one but what cared I. Seeing\r\nthemselves overtaken they reined up while Azad\xe2\x80\x99s bodyguard took\r\ndeliberate aim through the sights of his long gun. I could almost feel\r\nits cold muzzle on my brow. But they had reckoned without the power\r\nof the woman they carried. With a convulsive spring she threw herself\r\nabout the marksman and his bullet whistled over my head; a second later\r\nhe fell pierced by the last ball from my automatic which I flung into\r\nthe sand. In a flash I was alongside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAzad,\xe2\x80\x9d I shrieked--\xe2\x80\x9cyour hour has come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis usually calm face was twisted with evil passion, not unmixed with\r\nterror. Without the help of his henchmen the weight of the English\r\nwoman had been too much for him and I saw her huddled body slip from\r\nhis grasp and fall heavily to the sands. He pulled savagely at his\r\nbeast\xe2\x80\x99s mouth with the evident intention of backing and trampling\r\nher to death. But at that second I resorted to an old Moplah trick\r\nwhich is the pride of our tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEIK TO SHEIK\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAzad,\xe2\x80\x9d I shrieked,--\xe2\x80\x9cyour hour has come----.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sheik to Sheik]\r\n\r\nAt a distance of ten feet I pointed the muzzle of my gun into the sand\r\nand using it as a vaulting pole described an arc in the air. Even so\r\nI should have been severely if not fatally wounded for the low-lived\r\ncreature was alertly awaiting my descent to meet me with an inescapable\r\nblow of his razor edged _simla_.... I say \xe2\x80\x9cinescapable\xe2\x80\x9d for who can\r\ndodge in the air? But wait.... At the very second when by all the laws\r\nof gravitation I should fall against the sweeping blade, at the very\r\ninstant when the wiry desert pirate delivered what he meant should be\r\nmy death blow ... I pressed the trigger of my gun and fired it into the\r\nsand. The recoil of these Arab weapons is enormous. For an appreciable\r\ntime my flight was not only arrested but reversed.\r\n\r\nBird-like I leaped lightly clear of the whirring blade only to fall\r\nwith a crash on the baffled nomad\xe2\x80\x99s head, enveloping him in my burnous\r\nunder the folds of which I dragged him to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was now a Sheik to Sheik contest; in-fighting of the most inward\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nFighting in a burnous is very much like fighting under the bed clothes,\r\na pastime in which I had often indulged during my school-boy days.\r\nMoreover I was master of numerous grips and holds which are not in\r\nthe Arab vocabulary. But Azad was at grips with death and knew it; in\r\naddition I felt sure that he still had his pistol which, if he could\r\nbut press it against my side, would be unfortunate.\r\n\r\nHis wiry strength surprised me. He constantly slipped from my grasp. It\r\nwas like fighting a basket of eels in a clothes-hamper. Hither and yon\r\nwe thrashed. Once I got a grip on his Adam\xe2\x80\x99s apple and thought to have\r\nwrenched it from his throat but his teeth closed on my ear lobe and I\r\nloosened my hold. Now I heard the thud of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs, footsteps and\r\napproaching voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClub him! Club him!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted some one.\r\n\r\nBut the rescuing party were in a dilemma. They could not tell which of\r\nthe struggling forms to club. Resolved not to let go of my enemy, with\r\nmy brain reeling and the blood pounding in my temples I decided on a\r\ndesperate expedient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClub us both,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted with my last ounce of breath.\r\n\r\nA heavy blow sounded and the figure in my arms relaxed. Before I could\r\ncry \xe2\x80\x9cHold!\xe2\x80\x9d a second blow fell. A white light blazed before my eyes and\r\nI knew no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_Mine at Last!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThey told me afterward that I lay unconscious, hovering twixt life\r\nand death, for four days. On the fifth my temperature rose and I was\r\nseized by a delirium in which I babbled of early days, my boyhood in\r\nDerby, travels, dangers, women ... I know not all I said. But paramount\r\nin my thoughts was Lady Sarah whose name I called at intervals. Prior\r\nto coming up with Azad\xe2\x80\x99s men I had not slept for seventy-two hours. I\r\nhad ridden scores of miles, been wounded a dozen times and suffered\r\nfrom the keenest anxiety. The final blow on the head, added for good\r\nmeasure, had been the death of one less virile. But my will-to-live won\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day I slowly opened my eyes and gazed, mystified at the\r\nvision above me. It was Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s face but through my filmy pupils\r\nit loomed vague and indefinite like the harvest moon in a fog. Then my\r\nvision cleared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d I questioned.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and placed a finger on her lips with the familiar nurse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh ... you must not talk.\xe2\x80\x9d She wore the conventional nursing\r\ncostume in which all women look well. As she turned to busy herself\r\nprofessionally with a tray of medicine bottles a mounting tide of color\r\nsuffused her cheeks spreading to the ears and neck until they were a\r\nrich mahogany. Blessed creature! She too had suffered during her vigil.\r\nAt the thought I had an absurd vision of one of Giorgione\xe2\x80\x99s red angels\r\nbending over me. A weak laugh faltered on my lips. She was at my side\r\nin an instant, bottle in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime for meddy ... then go bye-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe poured out a moderate portion of something potent and pre-war. I\r\nsank back with a sigh of satisfaction. How good she was to me! and how\r\ngentle!... \xe2\x80\x9cMeddy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBye-bye\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Nurse.\xe2\x80\x9d I was asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow delightful are convalescent days. The mind is so keen and every\r\nstage of improvement brings such a thrill of adventure from the first\r\nbit of solid food to sitting up, being read to, talking and the bliss\r\nof the first cigarette. Then later came visits from friends, dainties\r\nsent in and the gradual putting-together of the past. Flowers, too--a\r\nvase of purple bugloss-blossoms from Effendi-Bazam. He too had been\r\nstruck down and barely rescued just as two Bassikuni were about to\r\ncarry out their threat of _laghouat blida_. I wept like a child at his\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nLord Wimpole\xe2\x80\x99s tent had been turned into a sick room while he occupied\r\nmine. I do not think he liked the arrangement but Lady Sarah had taken\r\nthese matters into her own hands. Little by little the story was told\r\nme, of how my men had turned the tide of battle and annihilated all\r\nbut a handful of Azad\xe2\x80\x99s forces who had fled into the desert. Seeing my\r\ngrievous state a messenger was sent to Ab-Domen which resulted in the\r\nconsolidation of the two caravans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate you arrived just when you did!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Sarah one\r\nevening, clasping her knees in her long bony hands. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother second\r\nwould have been too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d blustered Lord Wimpole pulling his stubby moustache, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nshould \xe2\x80\x99ave stood \xe2\x80\x99em off. You can\xe2\x80\x99t break a British Square y\xe2\x80\x99know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eye,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife coldly, flicking a cigarette ash in his\r\ndirection. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were all over us and you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWimpole mooned out of the tent while I was telling his lady of my\r\nfortunate application of the \xe2\x80\x9cpons asinorum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried. \xe2\x80\x9cMy French is atrocious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old geometric theorem; the bridge of asses over which every school\r\ndonkey must pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you did!\xe2\x80\x9d she enthused. \xe2\x80\x9cHow clearly it brings home the advantage\r\nof a college education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus we passed long hours in tender confidence during which I told\r\nher many things, she listening for the most part, as I recounted my\r\nlife from its infancy, with a nursery anecdote here and there, some\r\ndroll saying or madcap prank which I played on Miss Stafford, my\r\nfirst teacher. No detail seemed too slight to interest this wonderful\r\ncreature to whom I vowed to bare my whole existence. Step by step I\r\nworked my way through infancy to adolescence, boyish sports, my skill\r\nat mumblety-peg, my first affair with Norah Flaherty who worked in the\r\nmelodeon factory....\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of this tender incident that she bent over me late\r\none evening to tuck me in, her rose-rimmed eyes glowing into mine.\r\nInvoluntarily my arm encircled her gaunt framework drawing her down,\r\nclose ... close. Thus she knelt by my cot for a long moment before she\r\nrose with an effort at self mastery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you can get up tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, and the curtains\r\nswished softly on the night air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to Azad?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked one day.\r\n\r\nWhinney, who was visiting me, flicked an ash from his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour men claimed him after he came to. They buried him, Moplah style,\r\nyou know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see the wretched creature hands and feet bound, planted up to\r\nhis neck in hard-packed sand. The eyes invariably went first, toothsome\r\nmorsels for the vultures,--then came the ants and flies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe kept him alive as long as we could,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend, \xe2\x80\x9coccasionally\r\nthat Circassian girl used to go out and sprinkle salt and sand on his\r\nsore spots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be all for today,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, for I was still weak.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of ten days before I began to feel my full strength and\r\nresilience returning, days of short walks and long rests in a shaded\r\n_chaise-longue_. Whinney and Swank had laid out an excellent nine-hole\r\ngolf course where I was soon able to join them. Golf in the desert is\r\na simple affair, the course being entirely of sand one needs but two\r\nclubs, a driver and a niblick. It is like playing in a gigantic bunker\r\nand my game soon came back to me. Then there were afternoons of gazelle\r\nand gecko hunting with sloughi-hounds, the only dogs which can stand\r\nthe peculiar conditions of the desert for which nature has equipped\r\nthem with bushy, protective eye-brows, short beards and curiously\r\nsplay-toed feet which give them great speed over soft sand. Another\r\npastime of our leisure hours was the Arab\xe2\x80\x99s favorite pursuit of hawking.\r\n\r\nNo standard Sheik travels without his hawk or hawks, hung in gay\r\ncages from their pack camels and the women folk are constantly busy\r\nknitting hoods for the poor creatures who spend so much of their\r\ntime blindfolded. The reason for this constant blindfolding I had\r\nnever fully understood until Ab-Domen explained it. The theory is\r\nthat a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eye is only capable of just so much looking and it\r\nwould therefore be supremely unwise to let him wear his eyes out in\r\nthe contemplation of useless objects such as people and camels. Now,\r\nhowever, was the hawks\xe2\x80\x99 holiday and the air was specked with the\r\ngraceful creatures careering at dizzy heights like motes in a sunbeam.\r\nThey are recalled by a whistle which they obey with the marvellous\r\nintelligence of a day laborer at the noon hour, dropping whatever work\r\nthey may be engaged in to settle quietly on their masters\xe2\x80\x99 wrists.\r\n\r\nAn exception to this statement must be made in the case of a hawk in\r\npursuit of an _opapa_, a desert fowl closely akin to the Australian\r\ncarpenter-bird which it resembles in its hammer-head, saw-bill and\r\nlong, nail-like claws. Many a morning in the Cowba district (East\r\nof Sydney) I have been awakened by the building operations of these\r\ncreatures whose nests are solidly framed of gum-wood which is later\r\nstuccoed with a mixture of bird-lime and feathers. But I digress....\r\n\r\nThe _opapa_ of which I started to speak is for some reason unknown to\r\nornithology the deadly enemy of the hawk and once sighted is the object\r\nof a relentless attack. Seated one day in the encampment I witnessed\r\na grewsome battle between two of these implacable rivals of the air.\r\nThe recall had been sounded, but the hawk paid no attention to it. His\r\none thought was the complete annihilation of his antagonist which he\r\naccomplished by repeated attacks, closing-in, ripping-off tender strips\r\nof flesh and actually devouring the entire carcass save the saw-bill,\r\nbony hammer-head and nails; in other words, the hawk, in mid-air\r\nate the artisan and dropped only the tools, after which he returned\r\npeaceably to his master.\r\n\r\nBut our position in the camp was becoming increasingly difficult.\r\nOur water supply had been thrice replenished from the Tabala station\r\nwhich was at an inconvenient distance. Moreover the guardian of the\r\nwells began to protest against our frequent calls. \xe2\x80\x9cCaravans come and\r\ncaravans depart, but you are repeaters,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in effect. My strength\r\nnow was completely restored; under my folding burnous I could feel the\r\nsteel contours of hardening biceps, triceps and forceps. Will-power,\r\nambition, the old love of adventure were again in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nNow arose a difficulty which was destined to result in vital\r\nconsequences. I refer to the division of responsibility between Lord\r\nWimpole and myself. Here were two caravans each with an acknowledged\r\nleader. During my illness the supreme command had fallen in the\r\nEnglishman\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Incompetent though he was he could not bring\r\nhimself to relinquish it. Temporary power had gone to the little\r\nlace-maker\xe2\x80\x99s head and the inevitable battle of wills began. The first\r\nopen break occurred during a discussion as to future plans. Wimpole\r\nwas all for a continuation of the life of ease and luxury which so\r\nwell suited him. His absurd suggestion was an immediate removal to\r\nTabala with an indefinite stay there. My decision was to push on to the\r\nbeckoning East according to my original plans. In vain we argued. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nwell, we split,\xe2\x80\x9d said his lordship, his brow like thunder, his lower\r\nlip protruding like a camel\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe thought of leaving Lady Sarah was unbearable. Nevertheless with\r\na heavy heart I resolved on the sacrifice, ordering Ab-Domen to make\r\npreparations for our departure. But an incident occurred which modified\r\nthis laudable design.\r\n\r\nWimpole, since his re-establishment in his own tent, had reverted to\r\nhis old manner of brawling domesticity. Sounds of strife resounded\r\nnightly from their quarters, the grumbling of his heavy voice, rising\r\nto imprecation, the crash of china and an occasional cry of protest\r\nfrom his unfortunate wife. Nevertheless, as far as I knew, he had not\r\nresorted to open violence. Pained and apprehensive I continued my\r\npreparations. Daily the _doolahs_ trotted to and fro busily loading the\r\ncamel-packs and striking all but the necessary tents. The eve of our\r\nseparation arrived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWIN BEDOUINS OF THE EAST\r\n\r\nTraprock and Whinney constantly on guard against possible surprise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Twin Bedouins of the East]\r\n\r\nThe Wimpoles gave a dinner in their luxurious dining-tent. I sat on\r\nLady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s right, her husband being at the other end of the table.\r\nIt was a mournful feast. My heart was too full for food but I quaffed\r\nthe succession of vintage wines with reckless abandon. Our last evening\r\ntogether! At the thought my hand stole neath the napery to be met by\r\nthat of my loved-one which awaited me as a bird awaits its mate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp Jenkins!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Swank gaily. I crushed him with a look. But my\r\ncaution was useless. At his end of the table Lord Wimpole was already\r\nfar gone in drink. He was playing a harmonica, his favorite pastime\r\nwhen thus afflicted. Back of his chair Effendi patiently awaited his\r\nfinal collapse. His mental attitude was particularly quarrelsome and as\r\nthe libations gained their mastery he became more and more provocative\r\nuntil Lady Wimpole rose with a sigh and moved toward the tent entrance.\r\nThere she turned and her lips silently framed the words \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\ncommand I was able to obey almost instantly as my host was engaged in\r\nan interminable story which he had told twice before.\r\n\r\nStepping beyond the circle of light I peered into the gloom. Lady\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s figure was dimly visible, a patch of gray against the\r\nblackness. Joining her we strolled well beyond ear-shot. And yet we did\r\nnot speak.\r\n\r\nWhat was in our hearts lay too deep for words. It was the moment of\r\nsupreme renunciation. She looked long and searchingly in my eyes and at\r\nlast words came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Sheik!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, resting her hands on my shoulders.\r\n\r\nI drew her, trembling, to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered, lifting her heavy fringe of bobbed hair that\r\nshe might hear my low heart\xe2\x80\x99s cry, \xe2\x80\x9cmy Sarah of the Sahara, we have\r\nhad our little hour, thee and I. Now, by the law of thy people we must\r\npart. But by the law of my adopted people, the Moplahs, thou art mine,\r\nmy desert woman, my sweet sand lark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew back affrighted. Though I had spoken before in an exalted\r\nstrain I had never so definitely approached the topic of love. Then she\r\ntook my hand again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, El-Dhub,--\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you say is sweet and true. Thy words\r\nare as the nightingale\xe2\x80\x99s song. My heart and my love are indeed thine,\r\nbut see how I am encompassed ... By all the laws of my people I am\r\nbound to my over-lord yonder.... I can not free myself....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the glowing tent burst a wild strain of harmonica music, fierce,\r\nexultant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod pity me!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChoking with emotion I staggered to the tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwank!--Whinney!--we start at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey tumbled from their places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad! At this hour? Man alive....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.... Call Ab-Domen ... he and I will start ahead with four\r\ncamels. I must ride tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they obeyed my order Lady Sarah slipped by me into the tent, her\r\neyes dark with pain. Ab-Domen sleepily led out a small group of camels\r\nand the necessaries for our advance party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDue East,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Whinney, \xe2\x80\x9cleave out Tabala and proceed to the\r\nnext station at Hammababa. We will await you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight-o--Goodbye ... and good luck. We ought to get there in three\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy friends turned in for they needed sleep badly. A few moments later\r\nAb-Domen and I were ready for departure. Suddenly a piercing scream\r\nrang from the Wimpoles\xe2\x80\x99 tents and Lady Sarah rushed into the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEl-Dhub!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, take me with you. Look ... he has done it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up her arm and I saw the deep teeth-marks of her dog of a\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn him.... I will kill him \xe2\x80\x99ere we go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have done that.... I struck him ...\r\nwith a chafing dish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp, then ... mount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took her place on one of the camels. There was no thought of\r\nhesitation. Forth we fared on the swiftest of my bactrians forth into\r\nthe velvet night. Our camels travelled tactfully side by side. So\r\nmatched were their gaits that Lady Sarah could rest her head on my\r\nshoulder as we rode. It was not until six hours later, in the dawn,\r\nthat I discovered that sometime during the night Ab-Domen, the wily old\r\ndevil, had given us the slip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_Death in the Desert_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d I lowered my binoculars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Straordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Sarah spoke casually but I detected the undertone of anxiety in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\nWe had now been three days in the desert. To put the matter shortly,\r\nwe were lost. Gaze as we might there was no sign of the Hammababa\r\nstation nor of any other. Ab-Domen Allah\xe2\x80\x99s defection had doubtless\r\nbeen well-meant. Under more sophisticated conditions he had acted\r\nsimilarly before; but his absence now was deadly serious. Versed as he\r\nwas in the art of star-reading, a member in good standing of the Desert\r\nTrails Club, it would have been simple for him to set us on the right\r\ntrack. Also, relying on his knowledge I had taken no pains to look\r\nup constellations, distances, or direction. Our progress was a blind\r\nadvance, made the more so by our blinding love.\r\n\r\nAh, Sarah, my desert dish, canst thou forget that joyous pilgrimage\r\nneath the myriad eyes of night, throughout which I ever remained thy\r\nslave, reverent, respectful, devoted?\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, we should have come up with Hammababa long ago but\r\nnever so much as a palm frond had we seen. The devil of a camel is\r\nthat once off the proper direction he keeps right on in the wrong one\r\nwithout the slightest deviation. Nothing like instinct ever troubles\r\nthem. The desert is sprinkled with the bones of fool beasts that have\r\npursued this single-track policy into places where there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sign\r\nof sustenance and where they have just naturally died.\r\n\r\nThis thought did not cheer me any more than the condition of our water\r\nsupply. I figured that if we had overshot Hammababa we might possibly\r\nhit the water-hole at Rhat, but this was a long chance which I should\r\nhave hated to back with any real money.\r\n\r\nWhen one is lost in the desert one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say much about it. It is\r\nnot at all like being on the wrong road in a motor where a man\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nalways knows he is wrong and loudly proclaims it. Lady Sarah was a\r\ntrump; she never peeped. We just kept plodding on late at night and\r\nearly in the morning, resting during the heat of the day and neither\r\nof us voicing our suspicions. Finally on the morning of the fourth day\r\nI thought it was up to me to say something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Lady Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d I began--\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect that this sort of thing\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t getting us anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere that matters apparently,\xe2\x80\x9d she said calmly. Then, pointing\r\nskyward. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen those kites?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI _had_ seen them, first one, then two ... then two more ... appearing\r\nfor just a second in the sky, then vanishing, and I knew what they\r\nmeant. Shaking off a chill of forboding I dismissed the foul creatures\r\nwith an intrepid wave of my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur bones were not born to be bleached,\xe2\x80\x9d I said cheerily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s hoping,\xe2\x80\x9d was the brave reply.\r\n\r\nThus began the fourth day. It was a day of forced riding. Riding the\r\nlead-camel I urged the beasts to their best gait, keeping a close eye\r\non my pocket compass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHew to the East, let the sand fall where it may,\xe2\x80\x9d was my thought. Pad\r\n... fell the cushioned feet of our animals, pad ... pad ... pad ...\r\nmile after mile into nothingness. From noon until four o\xe2\x80\x99clock we\r\nrested, then, on--until nearly midnight when we sank exhausted for a\r\nfew hours\xe2\x80\x99 sleep. Food and water supply were running low. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cwe _must_ find something!\xe2\x80\x9d closing my eyes on the desperate\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nI awoke to a fresh catastrophe. In organizing our flight-caravan\r\nAb-Domen had included an extra pack-camel, an Asian dromedary, the\r\nmeanest type known to man. This made five beasts in all. Due to thirst\r\nand exhaustion they were nervous and irritable. The sound which aroused\r\nme was a loud roar almost human in its savageness.\r\n\r\nThe dromedary had attacked my high spirited mount and before I could\r\nshout a word of command or interfere in any way the entire group were\r\nmixed in an inextricable battle-royal. A fight between two camels is\r\na dangerous thing to approach; five made a storm center which was as\r\nmenacing as a buzz-saw.\r\n\r\nAmid a wild bellowing they charged, bumped, bit, kicked, whirled and\r\nfell, lashing, thrashing, smashing ... my heart sank as I heard the\r\nrending crack of bone against bone. After a mad half-hour they lay\r\ncompactly locked, exhausted, blood-shot, panting and glaring, hump\r\nlocked with hump, teeth bedded in soft flesh, legs protruding at every\r\nangle like a pile of animal jack-straws.\r\n\r\nWhen I was able to drag them, one by one, apart I knew that the worst\r\nhad befallen us. Out of twenty legs, seventeen were broken! Not a\r\nsingle beast was able to stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendous, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Sarah.\r\n\r\nI nodded. In spite of its import the tragedy could not fail to be\r\nspectacular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter milk the female,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nLady Sarah managed to extract about a gallon from our only cow-camel.\r\nWith heavy hearts and heavier loads we began our fateful march across\r\nthe wastes--afoot.\r\n\r\nJust how long or how far we walked is not quite clear in my mind.\r\nAt times we were unreasonably gay. Day and night became confused.\r\nWe struggled on when we were not too exhausted. Snatches of an old\r\nrefrain, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Japanese Sandman,\xe2\x80\x9d burst from my lips; then I would sing\r\nthe old Indian love lyric \xe2\x80\x9cCold hands I held, behind the Samo-va-ah,\r\nwhere are you now,--where are-ah you now?\xe2\x80\x9d And we would both weep,\r\nwatching our tears vanish in the aridity underfoot, \xe2\x80\x9clike snow upon the\r\ndesert\xe2\x80\x99s dusty face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn an undated day we lay down for what we felt to be our last rest.\r\nWe had done our best and it was not enough. In the early dawn Fate\r\nmocked us again. A tractor caravan passed at a distance of half a\r\nmile, part of the regular bus line between Tripoli and Assouan, their\r\nhead lights shining dimly in the wan light. Struggling to my feet I\r\ntried to run toward them. Ignominious though it might be to be rescued\r\nby such contraptions I had another\xe2\x80\x99s life to consider. \xe2\x80\x9cJitney!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nshouted--\xe2\x80\x9cJitney,\xe2\x80\x9d but the noise of their motors drowned my voice and,\r\nthe effort proving too much, I fell forward, gazing mournfully after\r\nthe receding tail-lights, two dim, red sparks that rose and fell and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Sarah, half-aroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCitroens,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrench ... for lemons,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a weak smile, sinking again to\r\nlethargy.\r\n\r\nLater in the day we managed to advance a few miles. I think we crawled\r\npart of the way. All supplies were now exhausted. I was burned like\r\na cinder; Lady Sarah was a flaming red--she never tanned; she was\r\npeeling, I remember, but still beautiful. Suddenly I sank back and\r\npointed with trembling finger--\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Look!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried through cracked\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nBefore us not over a mile away, in a low depression of the desert, lay\r\nwater! blessed water, fringed with green trees, to which I could see\r\nanimals coming to drink, impala, umpahs, gazelles and countless birds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Rhat-hole,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cCourage! dear witch; we shall win through\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYard by yard we made our painful advance. The details grew clearer\r\nuntil in my fevered imagination I could hear the cool splash of the\r\npool. And then, with the suddenness of a cinema fade-out the picture\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMirage,\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Lady Sarah had fainted.\r\n\r\nA hoarse kite-cackle sounded in my ears as I too sank in merciful\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_Antony and Cleopatra_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you followed the kites?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Your Altitude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ab-Domen, \xe2\x80\x9cfor several days I kept away,\r\nfor I thought you might wish ... that is ... the lady ...\xe2\x80\x9d; he grinned\r\nmaliciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not pre-arranged,\xe2\x80\x9d I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I began to see the birds,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI was worried. When I\r\nfound your smashed camels--by the way you were lucky in one respect,\r\nfor the beasts attracted the birds and held them back for a day--then\r\nI was really worried. I knew I should be useless without supplies so\r\nI rode at top speed to the caravan, changed camels for horses and\r\novertook you--just in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood old Ab-Domen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Sarah patting the oriental\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nWe were resting at the Rhat-hole which was not so far away as we had\r\nsupposed. The mirage we had seen was of the close-range variety and\r\nhad we had sufficient strength to keep on we might have reached it for\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nOur camp was at some distance from the pool in order not to disturb\r\nthe wild life to which it is so necessary a feature. These desert\r\nwater-holes differ in character from the South African variety. The\r\nvegetation is less dense and more low-growing and the animals are\r\nmostly limited to those of the locality, jerboa, jackals, whiffle-hens\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nWe did no shooting for it has always seemed to me extremely unsporting\r\nto kill unsuspecting animals while they are satisfying their thirst. It\r\nwas sufficiently entertaining to sit quietly in our compound and watch\r\nthe amazing variety of visitors to the filthy but refreshing waters.\r\nBeing the only source of supply in a large area it was occasionally\r\nvisited by creatures whose natural habitat was many miles away. Among\r\nothers a lean elephant who had evidently strayed far from his haunts to\r\nthe southward. He was one of the lop-eared Sudanese type, almost dying\r\nof thirst. It was interesting to see how in his case necessity became\r\nthe mother of invention for, having drunk as much as he could, he\r\nproceeded to fill his trunk against future need, hanging the end over\r\nhis ear in order to conserve the precious liquid.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we got our first hint of the distant Nile country toward\r\nwhich we were aiming. A group of ibis stalked along the edge of the\r\npool while, keeping very much to himself, I saw a specimen of the rare\r\nEgyptian wart-hog whose snout is spiraled to aid him in piercing the\r\nsand in search of lizard-eggs, his favorite food.\r\n\r\nOur way was now comparatively easy. We were in the region of\r\nAnglo-Egyptian influence where the efficiency of the British Government\r\nhas established a chain of oases at distances much nearer than that\r\nprovided by nature. Where water does not exist in natural wells it has\r\nbeen reached by boring or is piped in. Ab-Domen checked off the list\r\nof probable station stops. Wun, Borku, Liffi Ganda--the largest of the\r\nartesian oases,--Bongo, Meshra and so on, straight to the Egyptian\r\nfrontier....\r\n\r\nIt seemed unwise to leave Ab-Domen at this juncture for every time I\r\nhad done so the results had been unfortunate. As I looked back on my\r\nplight in Azad\xe2\x80\x99s camp and my narrow escape from death in the company of\r\nmy bronze beauty I realized that now, if ever, was a time for playing\r\nsafe. Lord Wimpole was left behind, a thing of the past, lost, to all\r\nintents and purposes, in the desert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was carted off to Tabala the morning after you and Lady Sarah\r\nleft,\xe2\x80\x9d Swank told me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come-to when they started so I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how he took her departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch I cared! I snapped my fingers.\r\n\r\nRestored to health, nourished with a generous supply of delicious\r\nfood, my monumental desert mate was more lovely than ever. The peeling\r\nprocess was over and she appeared re-born, a creature of red and gold.\r\nHow I looked forward to the Nile, with all its romantic associations.\r\n\r\nThe river came in sight at last after what seemed interminable days\r\ncrossing the low Wady Mahall hills. Late one afternoon I caught its\r\nsilver sheen where it wound its way between the fresh green of the rice\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d I pointed. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the Nile, O, my beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Antony!\xe2\x80\x9d ... she scarcely breathed the name. She was really\r\nwonderful in her way of catching the spirit and elevation of the\r\nmoment; her early education must have been thorough.\r\n\r\nOur last day\xe2\x80\x99s march was through fields of Egyptian cotton and Lady\r\nSarah made a remark that startled me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorace owns slathers of this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI grimaced at the name which showed she was thinking of him, and\r\nquickly drew her attention to a lovely field of sesame and lilies\r\nplanted in alternate rows. Here and there a band of native workmen\r\nwere weeding the vegetable-ivory-plants in preparation for the annual\r\ninundation. So shallow was the alluvial loam that their rude implements\r\nfrequently reached the underlying sand rich with the records of past\r\ncenturies, for this entire valley is but the graveyard of earlier\r\ncivilizations. Our passing excited mild wonder and one brawny Nubian\r\ntossed me a skull which Whinney said was clearly that of a man of the\r\nbone-age. How petty seemed the ticking of my wrist-watch measured by\r\nthe chronology of these mute memorials!\r\n\r\nWe intercepted the river in its upper reaches between the third and\r\nfourth cataracts, which are little more than rapids. In the village of\r\nHannik we rested, part of the caravan continuing to Red Sea ports while\r\nmy camels guided by Ab-Domen turned northward along the river bank.\r\nActing as my advance agent the faithful Turk made splendid arrangements\r\nfor river boats between the cataracts and lower down at Assouan I found\r\na magnificent dahabeah.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN DEITY\r\n\r\nBel-Toto, one of the lovely servitors of Lady Sarah on her dahabeah,\r\nthe El-Sali.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Egyptian Deity]\r\n\r\nIt was the most comfortable craft of its kind that could be devised and\r\nwas painted a brilliant emerald green, Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s favorite color.\r\nAb-Domen had not overlooked her name, El-Sali, in the vernacular, which\r\nadorned the bow. Crew, supplies, all were in readiness.\r\n\r\nIn the cabins lay fresh clothes suited to the locality and climate. A\r\nnative _fellah_ in immaculate white bounded forth whenever I clapped\r\nmy hands while Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s needs were looked after by a dusky Syrian\r\nmaid who fawned at her feet or swung her fan until we sent her away on\r\none pretext or another. My desert queen was a gorgeous picture when she\r\nfirst mounted the companion-way steps and stood under the green and\r\nwhite awning. She wore a _kaftan_ or portiere of brilliant blue draped\r\nover her shoulders, its fringe in which were hung small silver bells,\r\nreaching to her knees. This was supplemented by green silk trousers of\r\nankle length, sandals and a soft scarf. All nails, both toe and finger,\r\nwere bright with rouge and the underlids of her eyes were deep blue\r\nwith native Kohl. She was an arresting sight.\r\n\r\nEverywhere were jewels or pendant ornaments, bangles for wrist and\r\nankle, and long jade earrings so that she clinked when she walked like\r\na tray-full of drinks. I had donned a light weight burnous of two-inch\r\nstriped material suitable for a man in the early forties and discarded\r\nmy heavy Moplah turban for a _tarbush_. Our servants, overcome by our\r\nbeauty, backed down the companion-way crying upon Allah to protect them\r\nfrom such blighting splendor.\r\n\r\nOf all the days of my life those which succeeded are perhaps the most\r\nbeautiful. Can one imagine more exquisite conditions? Alone with the\r\nobject of one\xe2\x80\x99s adoration on the wonderful Nile, the most sentimental\r\nand sedimental of rivers. It was a voyage through Paradise, the life of\r\nlovers in lotus-land....\r\n\r\nSwank and Whinney, in a smaller craft, followed our course. For the\r\npassengers of El-Sali life was an uninterrupted dream. Day followed\r\nbright day in this rainless land while we drifted lazily on our way\r\nwatching the panorama of palms and quiet river-life, natives gathering\r\nlocusts from which they squeezed the honey, green-and-gold ichneumons\r\nflashing in the sun, shimmering fields of henna and fragrant basil,\r\nfishermen seeking ancient carp and the curious _boyad_ which has\r\nfeathers in place of scales, children playing with a _tetrodon_ or\r\nball-fish which they toss about gaily, whispering groves of mulberry\r\ntrees, marshes pink with mallow amid which stood flaming flamingos and\r\nibis both sacred and profane, water buffalo, okaki, coneys ... there\r\nwas no end to the variety and interest. Occasionally we stopped at\r\nnative villages and wandered in to the little bazaars inspecting the\r\ncurious wares, purchasing here and there a graceful reed basket, an\r\nornament of native turquoise and silver or a roughly cut emerald from\r\nthe mines at Jebel Zabara.\r\n\r\nAb-Domen had given orders for our entertainment and nightly we were\r\nhailed by dancers and singers from the shore or in boats. These came\r\naboard, Swank and Whinney joined us and we watched their performances.\r\nSome of the dervishes were remarkable.\r\n\r\nFurther down the river we began to pass the tombs and monuments of\r\nthe ancient dynasties and here the entertainments became more and\r\nmore elaborate for Ab-Domen cleverly utilized the crumbling temples,\r\ngigantic columns and seated figures as a background for the performers.\r\nAt the temple of Philae, notably, he put on a superb show with three\r\nprincipals and a chorus of six Egyptian beauties which caused Swank\r\nand Whinney to tie their dahabeah alongside forthwith.\r\n\r\nLate into the starry night I sat with my loved-one, continuing the\r\nstory of my life which had been so often interrupted, filling in the\r\ndetails of my college career with its mad, glad days and then my plunge\r\ninto exploration, the wonderful things I had accomplished, the people\r\nI had met, the honors ... it is not my way to talk about myself but I\r\nfelt I should tell all to this wonderful woman. She was such a superb\r\nlistener, quiet, mute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay something,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured, brushing her locks, sweet with jasmine and\r\nasphodel, \xe2\x80\x9cspeak, my oleander.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speechless,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI have always loved women of that sort, the simple, quiet ones,--broad\r\nbetween the eyes,--are they bovine? stupid? I do not know. They listen\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nThus Lady Sarah lay in her _chaise-longue_, quiet, smiling, listening\r\nto my odyssey. Sometimes her eyes closed and it almost seemed she\r\nslept....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_The Tomb of Dimitrino_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my way to pass through a country without drawing from it as\r\nmuch information and interest as possible. All my life I have been\r\na close student of archeology and here was an opportunity not to be\r\nmissed of pursuing certain investigations which had been attempted by\r\nothers and which I myself had begun and abandoned when the war called\r\nall able-bodied men to the colors.\r\n\r\nLike all Englishwomen Lady Sarah had a keen interest in investigations\r\nof this sort and heartily seconded the suggestion that I should give a\r\nday or two to the clearing up of some of the dynastic mysteries which\r\nhave baffled historians for many years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t go with you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese pyramids and\r\nsphinxes and things are simply infested with people from home ... it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know ... after I get my divorce, all right, but until\r\nthen....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow sane she was!\r\n\r\nI left her in the dahabeah, watched over by Ab-Domen who had by this\r\ntime safely convoyed his camels to Cairo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor three days only,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered, holding her tightly, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than\r\nthat I could not bear,\xe2\x80\x9d and without daring to look back I fled.\r\n\r\nMy objective was in the nearby terrain of the Valley of Kings but I\r\nknew better than to search in the actual valley itself which has been\r\ncompletely mussed by the hundreds of excavators who have sought the\r\nmissing chapters of Egyptian history. Here, it is true, they have found\r\nmuch that is interesting and worth-while. The recent discovery of the\r\ntomb of King Tut-Ankh-Amen was a creditable performance. But I was\r\nafter bigger game than that!\r\n\r\nIn beginning my quest I was greatly aided by certain papers which I had\r\npurchased many years ago from an old Levantine in Aden. He knew little\r\nof their value or I should never have secured them but vague markings\r\non the first documents told me that the packet belonged originally in\r\nthe library of Alexander the Great. Later they found their way into the\r\narchives of the Bab-el-Mandeb himself. Need I say more?\r\n\r\nI therefore kept to the north of the beaten track of exploration. The\r\nexpressions on the faces of numerous excavating parties which we passed\r\nwere amusing. They considered me insane to search for buried testimony\r\nin a location to which no reference was made in their data. Such is the\r\nnarrowness of many learned men.\r\n\r\nOur group was small consisting of not more than a score of _doolahs_ in\r\naddition to my usual companions Swank and Whinney. Five camels carried\r\nthe provisions and tools. The indications contained in my papers was\r\nso precise that I felt that I could verify their statements with very\r\nlittle delay. Either they were true or false and that could be soon\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to lay a very careful course following the exact\r\ncompass-directions of my palimpsest. This done we were soon swallowed\r\nup in the immensity of the desert. It was strange how, like a great\r\nmother, the land enveloped and enfolded us. But now I trudged it with\r\ndifferent feelings for back of me, waiting in the dahabeah, was Sarah,\r\nmy tiger-mate, my tawny desert-rose! Our plan was to go immediately\r\nto Paris where she was to join the American divorce colony, for she\r\nwished to be forever freed from her outrageous husband. This being\r\ndecided, I urged her to make haste so that the teeth-marks might still\r\nbe shown in evidence, for they were rapidly paling. Wimpole!--the cur\r\n... what had become of him?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ASSOUAN\r\n\r\nNative musician performing on the Balipsa, one of the earliest\r\nEgyptian wind-instruments.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the Outskirts of Assouan]\r\n\r\nRevolving these matters we marched on, stopping at the end of five\r\nhours for luncheon and a siesta. Here the _doolahs_ resorted to a\r\ncurious trick for, by wriggling their bodies, they wormed their way\r\ninto the sand and completely disappeared save for an occasional toe,\r\nelbow or kneecap which lay, oddly detached, on the burning floor. In\r\nthis way they escaped the direct rays of the deadly sun. Three hours\r\nlater the march was resumed.\r\n\r\nNot long after I ordered a halt. We had reached a point as near as I\r\nwished to go to the object of my search, for it was a part of my plan\r\nto make the actual discovery alone. Much as I respected the two men who\r\nwere with me I was too old a bird to ignore the fact that practically\r\nevery great discovery is marred by an attempt to divide the credit. In\r\nmatters of this sort it is best to be alone.\r\n\r\nCamp for the night being established I quietly strolled off by\r\nmyself. The sun still hung well above the horizon and I estimated\r\nthat I had fully two hours of daylight, though I took an electric\r\nflashlight as an extra precaution. The character of the surrounding\r\ncountry was peculiar in the extreme, consisting of thousands of small\r\ndome-like hills like bee-hives, each so like the other that my sense\r\nof orientation was instantly lost. Not over a half a mile from camp I\r\nlooked for our party and realized with a start that I was searching in\r\nexactly the opposite direction from the right one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCareful!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, studying my compass: \xe2\x80\x9cthis is dangerous country\r\nto travel in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the camp had disappeared. Proceeding with the greatest\r\ncare and constantly consulting both my papers and my compass I steered\r\nas straight a course as possible between the soft hillocks. An evening\r\nwind was rising and I noticed that its slightest breath was sufficient\r\nto ripple the hill-sides like shaken silk. In a stronger blast the\r\nmounds must actually move. Not without a sense of disquiet I observed\r\nthat the landscape back of me had already changed slightly--or did it\r\nonly seem so?\r\n\r\nOne hour of my precious time had passed. Should I go on--or return?\r\nHesitating, a fresh detail lured me forward. To the north-west and\r\ndominating the surrounding mounds rose one considerably higher.\r\nAccording to my documents I should now be at the site of the most\r\nastounding discovery possible in this corner of the world. Resolved to\r\nmake a last inspection from this hill I made my way toward it.\r\n\r\nEven as I ascended its eastern side a thrill crept up my spine for I\r\ncould see that the ground sloped sharply away to the west which, my\r\npapers said, it should do. And on the top of the knoll I stood aghast.\r\n\r\nYes! it was true. I had found it. I, Walter Traprock, American, stood\r\nawed, silent and alone, looking down into the Lost Valley of Bulls, the\r\nburial place of Dimitrino, the First of the Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nLet me say here that I do not belittle the importance of Tut-Ankh-Amen,\r\nbut may I also point out that he has been widely acclaimed because he\r\nwas the _last_ of the Pharaohs? Dimitrino, I repeat, was the _first_.\r\nIt is obvious to whom the greater credit must go. Year after year, for\r\ncenturies, historians have groped for some allusion, some hint which\r\nshould guide them to the spot which lay before me.\r\n\r\nThe tomb occupied the center of a small valley in which the purple\r\ndusk already lay heavy. Against my better judgment, chuckling\r\nexcitedly, I ploughed down the sloping banks, passed between two\r\ngigantic porphyry bulls and finally stood beside the mausoleum itself.\r\nThough intending to make only a cursory examination one exciting\r\ndetail led to another. The smoothly worked granite blocks with their\r\nclose joints excited my wonder. Near the top of the dome in a band of\r\nornamentation I noted a bronze ring artfully worked in the design.\r\nIt was comparatively easy to climb the curving sides and reach this\r\nstone. It was large and I had not the faintest idea that it would\r\nmove. Imagine my surprise then when it slid slowly under a strong\r\npull and I gazed down through a square opening into the blackness of\r\nthe actual burial chamber. With a thrill of fear I bent forward, head\r\nand shoulders through the aperture and flooded the great room with my\r\nflashlight. Wonder of wonders! What splendors lay below me.\r\n\r\nI had only time to glimpse a dazzling array of gold and brilliant color\r\nwhen my legs were suddenly lifted up from behind and I was thrust\r\nviolently forward through the opening. Twisting as I fell I quickly\r\nflashed my light upward. The great stone was slowly sliding into place\r\nbut in the narrowing space the beam of my flash fell on the distorted\r\nfeatures of Horace Wimpole.\r\n\r\nMy head suddenly swam with dizziness and I fainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_Buried Alive_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMy revival was sudden and violent. For a second I lay semi-conscious;\r\nthen realizing my predicament, every fibre rebelled at the ridiculous\r\nsituation. Caught ... caught again, like a rat in my own trap. Blindly\r\nI rushed about in the blackness of the tomb. Underfoot resounded the\r\ncrash of fragile furniture, the splintering of priceless relics. My\r\nhead struck some sort of musical instrument built on the tambourine\r\norder which fell to the floor with a weird jangling of copper discs.\r\nThen I stumbled over a great urn and lay panting amid the fragments.\r\n\r\nWhere was my light? In a sickening panic I groped for it ... thank God!\r\nmy hand closed about it almost instantly ... perspiration dripped from\r\nmy forehead. I did not press the button of my flash at once. Somewhat\r\ncalmed by its possession I brooded bitterly, glad that the darkness\r\ncould hide me from myself. Fool! ... _fool_ that I was to have been so\r\ntrapped ... to have felt so fatuously secure. Not a thought had I given\r\nto Wimpole during my exquisite \xe2\x80\x9c_r\xc3\xaave d\xe2\x80\x99amour_.\xe2\x80\x9d He was dismissed ...\r\nwaved away like a wraith. But he had materialized.\r\n\r\nHow had he done it?\r\n\r\nA score of answers thronged my brain. Disguised, perhaps he had\r\naccompanied me, mingling with my humble _doolahs_ or, more probably,\r\nhad followed me, keeping apart, weaving his way, snake-like, through\r\nthe hills, watching and waiting to strike the dastard blow. G\xe2\x80\x99r-r-r ...\r\nI ground my teeth in impotent rage.\r\n\r\nBut stay ... this was idiotic. Gradually I calmed and for the first\r\ntime switched on my light. Playing it on the ceiling I realized that\r\nall trace of the moveable stone was lost in the complicated decoration.\r\nClimbing a wall which curves inward is one of the most difficult\r\nfeats in the world, though I have been able to do it in the past. But\r\nnow it seemed so futile. Any search of the ceiling would have lacked\r\ndirection. Without moving I gazed sombrely about me.\r\n\r\nI was buried alive, there was no getting away from that. Having chewed\r\nthis bitter cud for several minutes I resolved to put my spiritual\r\nhouse in order, so to speak. My first act was to make my will,\r\nsomething I had frequently proposed and as often postponed. It occurred\r\nto me now that my position was probably unique in drawing up this last\r\ntestament after I had been entombed. All that I possessed I left to\r\nLady Sarah in fee simple or to her heirs or assigns forever, to have\r\nand to hold, from now on until death us do part--the form was strictly\r\nlegal and I signed Whinney\xe2\x80\x99s name as witness, per W. E. T. to make all\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my last words.\xe2\x80\x9d In vain I tried to evolve\r\nsome simple, compact sentence which would epitomize my entire life but\r\nthe subject was too large. Finally I compromised on a five-hundred word\r\nobituary outlining the main events of my career. I then recited what\r\nI could remember of the burial service and considered that I had been\r\ndecently laid away.\r\n\r\nWith these rites performed I could composedly take stock of my\r\nsurroundings for it occurred to me that I could put my time to no\r\nbetter use than by writing a careful inventory of the contents of the\r\nmausoleum. That much at least could remain as my legacy to the culture\r\nof the world. Then for the first time I realized the magnitude of the\r\ndiscovery in which I had so completely lost myself.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those interested in archeology I will give a mere\r\noutline of the main features, the principal one of which was, of\r\ncourse, the basalt sarcophagus of the King himself. Beside this in a\r\nsimilar receptacle a few sizes smaller lay his favorite Queen, Heck-To.\r\nRanged about the walls was a dazzling array of royal furniture, boxes,\r\nchairs, beds, chariots, tables, vases and so on. All the latter were\r\nof solid gold heavily encrusted with gems. Many of the vessels were\r\nfilled with food but the contents of the wine jars had unfortunately\r\nevaporated so that I could only look forward to dry fare for a brief\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe picture writing on the walls was of immense interest and showed\r\nDimitrino at his favorite pursuits, hawking, hunting, catching scarabs\r\nand playing Mah Jong which even in his day was an old game. One\r\nintimate close-up portrayed the monarch using a dial system telephone\r\nwhich the modern world is now re-discovering with so much trouble.\r\nAnother section showed him teaching archery to his son who afterwards\r\nbecame Melachrino I.\r\n\r\nNumerous passages were in verse which, in hieroglyphics, is effected\r\nby rhyming the symbols in idea, a bird with an egg, a bow with an\r\narrow, a snake with a woman, and so on. A scene very lovely in color,\r\ndepicted the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Eks-Ito, being devoured by vultures, the\r\nKing and his son looking on.\r\n\r\nAbout the sarcophagus stood the tutelar divinities, Psh, Shs, Pst and\r\nTkt, the big four of their day. The queen\xe2\x80\x99s lid bore an intaglio of\r\nThothmes indicating that she had a hare-lip. Hundreds of articles I\r\nlisted carefully in my note-book, becoming completely absorbed in my\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThen gradually a chill horror numbed my body. _My light was going\r\nout!_ There was no doubt about it. It was fainter than it had been.\r\nThe battery was fading. To die, thus, in the dark! ... horrible. My\r\ndetermination to complete my catalogue drove me to fresh effort.\r\nHaving completed the movable objects I made a closer inspection of\r\nthe sarcophagus itself. On the top carved in high relief lay a coiled\r\nsnake. As I reached my hand toward it, to my amazement, its head raised\r\nand I saw the coils stiffen. Across my brain flashed the thought that\r\nthis was the King\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cKa,\xe2\x80\x9d his spiritual familiar and guardian. But no,\r\nthat was rot; the creature was alive!\r\n\r\nSubconsciously a ray of hope sprang in my breast. Not realizing just\r\nwhy, I reached my light toward the serpent. When it had almost touched\r\nhim he glided silently over the edge of the stone, dropped with a thud\r\non the tiled floor and flowed like a black stream to the edge, back of\r\na delicate table, where he disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn a frenzy I hurled the furniture out of the way and cast myself on\r\nthe floor playing my light before me. There was the snake\xe2\x80\x99s exit, where\r\na tile was loosened against the side wall. And if his exit, why not\r\nmine?\r\n\r\nIdiot, not to have thought of it before! The construction of tombs\r\nis peculiar. They have practically no foundations. In this country\r\nwith no frosts or moisture it is only necessary to go an inch or two\r\nbelow the level of the hard-packed sand. Dashing the tile aside I felt\r\nthe surface below. It was friable and crumbled easily under my hand.\r\nScratching the sand deeply with my pen-knife I scraped up the top layer\r\nwith a shallow copper bowl. In another moment I was burrowing madly\r\nlike an excited mole.\r\n\r\nIn an hour I was completely submerged. My flash was thrust in my breast\r\npocket where I could occasionally play its waning beam on the tunnel\r\nbefore me. But I soon learned to do my work in the dark, passing the\r\nsand back of me and worming my way forward. Above me I could feel the\r\nmasonry of the enclosing wall, first on my head, then my shoulders,\r\nwaist ... legs ... I was free of it.\r\n\r\nAs I began to turn my tunnel upward the sound of a solid slump caused\r\nme to play the light over my shoulder and look back as well as I could.\r\nA large mass of sand had fallen from the roof of the tunnel. Not being\r\nable to dig with my feet or to turn in the passage any retreat was cut\r\noff. It was do or die now and with desperate energy I wielded my scoop.\r\n\r\nStrange that I did not reach the surface! On, on, I went and still\r\nthere was no light ahead. My sense of direction became confused. Was\r\nI going upward or digging my grave deeper and more irrevocably in the\r\narid earth. My strength, unusual though it is, was giving out and this\r\ndreadful doubt as to my direction served further to sap my energy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred more scoops\xe2\x80\x9d--I vowed ... still no air ... fifty more ...\r\ntwenty-five ... ten ... one ... I broke through. Air, blessed air, cool\r\nand refreshing as water. Panting I lay with only my head above ground.\r\nIt was night, and such a night! blowing a gale with the wind heavily\r\nfreighted with sand. But amid the stinging drifts I rolled over and\r\nslept the sleep of a child.\r\n\r\nThe bright sun woke me and I staggered to my feet shaking the sand from\r\nmy garments and staring stupidly before me. My experience came back\r\nslowly like a confused dream. The tomb. O, yes ... the tomb ... but\r\nwhere was it? I rubbed my eyes. There was no tomb. And then I realized\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\nDuring my incarceration the gale had heaped the sand-drifts about my\r\nprison until it was completely covered. No trace or trail indicated its\r\nposition. Of my tunnel there was not a vestige and I realized why it\r\nhad taken me so long to reach the surface.\r\n\r\nThe entire topography had changed. Wily old Dimitrino! To tuck his tomb\r\naway in this shifting, evasive landscape where he was literally here\r\ntoday and gone tomorrow!\r\n\r\nThank Heavens my compass could not run down and I still had my records.\r\nAt the thought of the return trip memory re-illumined the flame of\r\nanger but, close on its searing glow, burst the effulgence of love.\r\nFaint from hunger but buoyed by my inextinguishable passion I stumbled\r\nthrough the distorted territory where, verily, as the old Hebrew says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe little hills skip like rams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_Love Lost_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the dawn I began my return. The wind had fallen and progress\r\nwas not difficult. Once out of the curious hill country which had again\r\ntaken the lost Valley of Bulls into its embrace it was a simple matter\r\nto locate my camp which was the only visible object in the open desert.\r\nMy companions were overjoyed at my return for, though an overnight\r\nabsence on my part was not unusual, they were always anxious until I\r\nput in an appearance.\r\n\r\nBut their welcome was submerged in their wonder at my orders for an\r\nimmediate return to Assouan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Swank, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve just got here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\naccomplished nothing; it\xe2\x80\x99s....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cut him short with a severe glance vouchsafing only the remark \xe2\x80\x9cFoul\r\nplay is afoot. Make haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw that something serious had happened and obeyed unquestioningly.\r\nThe rank and file of my safari were delighted at the prospect of\r\ngetting back to the comforts of the more civilized river-life. More\r\nthan once it was on my lips to tell my American companions the story\r\nof my entombment with all its possibilities of future riches and fame,\r\nbut the thought of Lady Sarah lay too heavily on my heart. This burden\r\nof apprehension I must carry alone. Weighed down with my individual\r\nanguish I plodded silently across the sand, my mind too busy with\r\npictures of what might have happened to even note the signs of our\r\nprogress, the merging of the desert into the fertile fields with\r\ntheir long lines of irrigation ditches, the flourishing plantations\r\nof capsicum and marrows alive with chattering apteryxes and flocks of\r\nfour-horned sheep.\r\n\r\nWith a start I realized that we were on the outskirts of Assouan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, detaching my fellow countrymen from the\r\nnatives. We ran on ahead and soon came in sight of the El-Sali moored\r\nby the river bank. She was ominously quiet. Bursting into the salon\r\nI gazed upon a picture which was the exact counterpart of my most\r\nlurid imagining. The room was a wreck, curtains torn down, vases\r\nbroken, rugs twisted, chairs and tables overturned. Ab-Domen lay\r\nunconscious under the ruins of the victrola. A low moaning from the\r\napartment beyond led us to Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s maid, likewise in the stupor of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the faithful dragoman was partially revived he breathed a\r\nharrowing story of assault and abduction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Wimpole came ...\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped ... \xe2\x80\x9che had twenty men ... Lady\r\nEl-Sali fought like a tigress ... you see?...\xe2\x80\x9d he motioned weakly at\r\nthe surrounding chaos.... \xe2\x80\x9cI, too, did my best....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did they go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cDown river ... where to I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent highway along the Nile bank from Assouan to the\r\nDelta. In half an hour we were on our way, mounted on the best of our\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarah!\xe2\x80\x9d I screamed in my agony, \xe2\x80\x9cit can not be that we have lost each\r\nother so soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE SHADOW OF THE PYRAMID\r\n\r\nZaloofa, the slave girl, wearing the costume of the native Awabodas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Shadow of the Pyramid]\r\n\r\nMy only hope was that Wimpole, solacing himself with the thought that\r\nhe had effectually put me _hors de combat_, would loiter on his way.\r\nBut this ray was soon extinguished for inquiry at the villages on\r\nour route informed us that the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s party had gone through by\r\nmotor! At the word my heart sank; all thought of overtaking him was out\r\nof the question. Yet, desperately, we kept on.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night when the lights of Cairo twinkled in the distance.\r\nLeaving our horses and chartering a powerful car we were soon speeding\r\ntowards Alexandria. The first sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays lighted the listless sails\r\nand gleaming hulls of the ships at anchor, battered tramps and giant\r\nliners from overseas, trim yachts, an occasional sombre battleship\r\nand thousands of sturdy fishing craft. Two vessels were my immediate\r\nobject, the Wimpole\xe2\x80\x99s Undine and my own Kawa. A long scrutiny from\r\nthe rising ground back of the Port failed to disclose them. Parking\r\nour car we lost ourselves in the forest of masts along the harbor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedge. It was impossible that Triplett had failed me but locating him\r\nwas like finding one\xe2\x80\x99s automobile after a foot-ball game. Standing on\r\nvarious pier heads I cupped my hands and bellowed \xe2\x80\x9cKawa-a-hoy\xe2\x80\x9d until I\r\nwas twice threatened with arrest by the local constabulary. Meanwhile\r\nSwank and Whinney were paging my captain in other directions, the\r\nformer cruising about in a rented rowboat while the latter conducted\r\na personal canvass of the water-side drinking-parlors. In one of these\r\nTriplett was eventually discovered. He was amazed at my early arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t look fur ye fur a week,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Undine in the harbor?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWuz, last night ... takin\xe2\x80\x99 on supplies all day; moved out by the\r\nlighthouse at sundown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, man; let\xe2\x80\x99s get aboard. We must board her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Kawa lay surrounded by a huddle of small boats the crews of which\r\nobjected violently to being shoved aside but we forced our way through\r\nand eventually cleared the end of the pier and stood out toward the\r\nmole, our kicker-motor chugging valiantly. I had fetched my glasses\r\nfrom below and soon located the Undine. She was nearly two miles\r\ndistant and to my consternation showed every indication of being about\r\nto get under weigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must make better time,\xe2\x80\x9d I urged. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we crowd on more sail or do\r\nsomething nautical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrowd on nothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Triplett. \xe2\x80\x9cWind\xe2\x80\x99s dead agin us.\xe2\x80\x9d He spat\r\nsourly as was his wont and I knew from the glint of his one useful eye\r\nthat what man could do he would do. Foot by foot we crept up on the\r\nslender Undine out of whose buff funnel smoke poured with increasing\r\nvolume. We could now see the glint of her brass work and read the name\r\nunder her stern. The squeak of the davit-blocks reached us as the tiny\r\nlaunch was hauled up and swung in-board; then came the clink, clink of\r\nthe capstan. It was up-anchor now and no mistake.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Swank made one of the greatest blunders of his life\r\nand that is saying a lot. Overcome by excitement he seized a large\r\nmegaphone and before I could stop him raised it and howled \xe2\x80\x9cUndine\r\na-hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted striking the instrument from his grasp.\r\n\r\nIt was the very thing which he should not have done. In quiet we might\r\nhave slipped alongside. Now all was activity aboard the yacht. Sailors\r\nran to and fro, bells rang sharply, the anchor swung dripping over the\r\nbow and a lather of white foam bubbled up from the obedient screws.\r\n\r\nWe were not over a hundred yards away. In desperation I seized the\r\nmegaphone. \xe2\x80\x9cStop, in the name of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted; it was all I\r\ncould think of at the time.\r\n\r\nA harsh laugh was my answer followed by a shriek, the well-known shriek\r\nof my beloved, which tore my heart strings. In the salon I caught a\r\nglimpse of two struggling figures; then, just as other bulky forms\r\nintervened, a bright object flew through the open porthole. At that\r\nmoment the Undine\xe2\x80\x99s stern swung toward us and gathering headway she\r\nshrank rapidly to a tiny speck on the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nWe hove-to. \xe2\x80\x9cLower the dingy,\xe2\x80\x9d I ordered. Alone I rowed toward the\r\nbright object which I had seen fly from the cabin window. If it were\r\nwhat I hoped ... yes ... a bottle. Within was the briefest sort of\r\nmessage, merely the word ... \xe2\x80\x9cRitz.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBack in my cabin I pondered in bitter perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cRitz?\xe2\x80\x9d It was a call\r\nto follow her ... it was a meeting place ... but which Ritz? There are\r\nso many.\r\n\r\nI am not one to give up easily. Gradually a scheme formed in my mind.\r\nI would establish an inter-Ritz communication system with agents in\r\nall branches. Triplett\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in the doorway interrupted my\r\nruminations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied and, a moment later, felt the Kawa veer toward the\r\ngreat English city.\r\n\r\nFate in her inscrutable way was to end my search almost before it had\r\nbegun. Eight weeks later I sat in the tea room of the Ritz-Carlton in\r\nLondon. Opening my paper I scanned the headlines dealing with cable\r\ndespatches, racing news and financial exchange until an item, brutal in\r\nits brevity, assaulted my attention as with a hammer stroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Sarah Wimpole Dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room swam about me. After a tremendous effort at self mastery I was\r\nable to read what followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe death of Lady Sarah Wimpole, nee Alleyne, of Alleyne House and\r\nWimpole Manor, Nottinghamshire, will come as a shock to her many\r\nfriends. Her medical advisors, Dr. Keech and Dr. McGilvray, confess\r\nthemselves as much mystified by the nature of the malady which has\r\nproved fatal. In all respects the symptoms were those of hydrophobia,\r\nwhich is not an admissible diagnosis since Lady Wimpole had but just\r\nrecently landed from her yacht, the Undine, upon which she and Lord\r\nWimpole have been cruising in Eastern waters. It is suspected that the\r\ndisease may have been conveyed by a parrot of which the defunct Peeress\r\nwas very fond and the bird--very wisely in our opinion--has been\r\ndestroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAD MEMORIES\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe smooth flowing Nile retains her reflection.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sad Memories]\r\n\r\nHow clearly the tragedy stood before my eyes. Wimpole, mad cur that\r\nhe was, had had his way! My first impulse was to shoot him down as he\r\ndeserved. Second thought said no. Let him live out his wretched life\r\nuntil un-reason claimed him as she was bound to do. Within a year he\r\nwas incarcerated, a hopeless maniac, fighting and biting at his keepers.\r\n\r\nTime has softened the pain of this, my most tragic adventure. Out\r\nof the wreckage of my hopes and dreams the lovely moments rise like\r\nmountains from mist. Sitting alone in my study, brooding over the\r\nromances of my life, none has quite the charm of this, the most\r\ndisastrous and incomplete.\r\n\r\nIt was my plan--after Lady Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s divorce and our marriage--to return\r\nto the desert where we had great plans for commercial development, the\r\nbuilding of sand-paper mills and hour-glass factories,--but there!\r\nThese were but bubbles blown away by the touch of reality. With our few\r\nbrief moments of complete joy I must be content.\r\n\r\nThat I should return to follow out our plans alone is inconceivable.\r\nAll speaks too clearly of her influence who called me back to reign\r\nonce more as El-Dhub ak Moplah. The sandy desert is her likeness. The\r\nsmooth flowing Nile retains her reflection. The rocky features of the\r\nSphinx are those of my Sarah of the Sahara.

U.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA delicious literary burlesque--superlatively amusing. Here are found\r\nthe _wak-wak_, that horrid super-seamonster; the gallant _fatu-liva_\r\nbirds who lay square eggs; the flowing _hoopa_ bowl, and the sensuous\r\n_nabiscus_ plant; the tantalizing, tatooing, fabulous folk music; the\r\nbeautiful, trusting Filbertine women and their quaint marriage customs,\r\nas well as the dread results of the white man\xe2\x80\x99s coming--all described\r\nwith a frank freedom, literary charm, and meticulous regard for truth\r\nwhich is delightful.\r\n\r\nThe Cruise of the Kawa stands unique among the literature of modern\r\nexploration. Nothing like it has ever come out of the South Seas. It is\r\n_the_ travel book of years. Strikingly illustrated, too, from special\r\nphotographs, it tells pictorially, as well as verbally, the exciting,\r\namusing, and entertaining story of an exploration in the South Seas.\r\n\r\n  G.

It is an account of the adventures of the redoubtable Dr.\r\nTraprock (and party) who set out to discover the real North Pole--but\r\nundertake their voyage in a most unusual manner. The incidents,\r\naccidents, and final discoveries in this merry burlesque are certain to\r\nafford as much, if, indeed, not more enjoyment than the first _Kawa_\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n21 gorgeous full page illustrations.\r\n\r\n  G.
