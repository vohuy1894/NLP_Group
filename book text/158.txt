Her mother had\r\ndied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\r\nof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\r\nas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\r\n\r\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s family, less as a\r\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\r\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even\r\nbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\r\nthe mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\r\nrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\r\nhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\r\nand Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njudgment, but directed chiefly by her own.\r\n\r\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s situation were the power of having\r\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\r\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\r\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so\r\nunperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSorrow came\xe2\x80\x94a gentle sorrow\xe2\x80\x94but not at all in the shape of any\r\ndisagreeable consciousness.\xe2\x80\x94Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\r\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\r\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\r\nand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\r\ncheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after\r\ndinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\r\nhad lost.\r\n\r\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was\r\na man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\r\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\r\nwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\r\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning\xe2\x80\x99s work for her. The want\r\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\r\npast kindness\xe2\x80\x94the kindness, the affection of sixteen years\xe2\x80\x94how she had\r\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old\xe2\x80\x94how she had\r\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health\xe2\x80\x94and how nursed\r\nher through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\r\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\r\nthe equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\r\nIsabella\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\r\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\r\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\r\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\r\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\r\nhers\xe2\x80\x94one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\r\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\r\n\r\nHow was she to bear the change?\xe2\x80\x94It was true that her friend was going\r\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\r\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\r\nMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\r\ndomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\r\nsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\r\nHe could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\r\n\r\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\r\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\r\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\r\nor body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\r\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\r\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\r\n\r\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\r\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\r\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\r\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\r\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\r\nand give her pleasant society again.\r\n\r\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\r\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\r\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\r\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\r\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\r\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\r\neven half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\r\nsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\r\nand made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\r\nwas a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\r\nused to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\r\nMatrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\r\nby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marrying, nor could\r\never speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\r\nmatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\r\ntoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\r\nto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\r\nwas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\r\nherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\r\nhad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\r\nchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\r\nwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\r\nsaid at dinner,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Miss Taylor!\xe2\x80\x94I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\r\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\r\ngood-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a\r\ngood wife;\xe2\x80\x94and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\r\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\r\nown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA house of her own!\xe2\x80\x94But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\r\nThis is three times as large.\xe2\x80\x94And you have never any odd humours, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!\xe2\x80\x94We\r\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\r\nvisit very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\r\nnot walk half so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\r\nto be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\r\nlittle way;\xe2\x80\x94and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\r\nvisit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are to be put into Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s stable, papa. You know we have\r\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\r\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\r\nto Randalls, because of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s being housemaid there. I only\r\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\r\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\r\nmentioned her\xe2\x80\x94James is so obliged to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\r\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\r\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\r\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\r\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\r\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\r\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\r\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\r\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\r\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\r\nbe able to tell her how we all are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\r\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\r\nthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\r\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\r\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\r\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\r\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s husband. He lived\r\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\r\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\r\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\r\nsome days\xe2\x80\x99 absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\r\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\r\nWoodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\r\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Isabella\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\r\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\r\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\r\nhave had a shocking walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\r\nmust draw back from your great fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\r\ncatch cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\r\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\r\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the bye\xe2\x80\x94I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\r\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\r\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\r\nall behave? Who cried most?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! poor Miss Taylor! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a sad business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98poor Miss Taylor.\xe2\x80\x99 I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\r\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!\xe2\x80\x94At any rate, it\r\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\r\ncreature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma playfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is what you have in your head, I\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, with\r\na sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\r\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\r\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\njoke\xe2\x80\x94it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\r\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\r\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\r\nwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\r\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\r\nevery body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma knows I never flatter her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I meant no\r\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\r\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\r\na gainer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, willing to let it pass\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou want to hear about the\r\nwedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\r\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\r\nnot a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\r\nwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\r\nevery day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Emma bears every thing so well,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr.\r\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\r\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nKnightley. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\r\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\r\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\r\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\r\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cand a\r\nvery considerable one\xe2\x80\x94that I made the match myself. I made the match,\r\nyou know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\r\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\r\nmay comfort me for any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! my\r\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\r\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\r\nmatches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\r\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\r\nsuccess, you know!\xe2\x80\x94Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\r\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\r\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\r\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\r\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Weston need not spend\r\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\r\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\r\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\r\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\r\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver since the day\xe2\x80\x94about four years ago\xe2\x80\x94that Miss Taylor and I met\r\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\r\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\r\nFarmer Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\r\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\r\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\r\nmatch-making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand what you mean by \xe2\x80\x98success,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuccess supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\r\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\r\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s mind! But\r\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\r\nmeans only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\r\nto marry her,\xe2\x80\x99 and saying it again to yourself every now and then\r\nafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\r\nyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?\xe2\x80\x94I\r\npity you.\xe2\x80\x94I thought you cleverer\xe2\x80\x94for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\r\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\r\nword \xe2\x80\x98success,\xe2\x80\x99 which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\r\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\r\nbut I think there may be a third\xe2\x80\x94a something between the do-nothing and\r\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s visits here, and given\r\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\r\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\r\nenough to comprehend that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\r\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\r\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\r\ngood to them, by interference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, pray do not\r\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\ncircle grievously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\r\nElton, papa,\xe2\x80\x94I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\r\nHighbury who deserves him\xe2\x80\x94and he has been here a whole year, and has\r\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\r\nhim single any longer\xe2\x80\x94and I thought when he was joining their hands\r\nto-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\r\nkind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\r\nthe only way I have of doing him a service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good\r\nyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew\r\nhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.\r\nThat will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so\r\nkind as to meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley,\r\nlaughing, \xe2\x80\x9cand I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\r\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\r\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\r\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\r\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\r\ngentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\r\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\r\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\r\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by\r\nentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\r\n\r\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\r\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great\r\nYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\r\nsurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\r\nwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would\r\noffend.\r\n\r\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x94though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\r\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off\r\nwith due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce\r\nmuch happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had\r\na husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing\r\ndue to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\r\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\r\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but\r\nnot enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\r\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\r\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\r\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\r\n\r\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\r\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\r\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years\xe2\x80\x99 marriage, he\r\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\r\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\r\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\r\ncreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\r\nof the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some\r\nreluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\r\nwere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\r\ncare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\r\nto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\r\n\r\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\r\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\r\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\r\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\r\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\r\noccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\r\nyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\r\nrealised an easy competence\xe2\x80\x94enough to secure the purchase of a little\r\nestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for\xe2\x80\x94enough to\r\nmarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according\r\nto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.\r\n\r\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\r\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\r\nhad not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\r\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\r\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\r\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\r\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\r\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\r\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\r\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\r\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\r\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\r\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\r\n\r\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\r\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\r\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,\r\ntherefore, that he should ever want his father\xe2\x80\x99s assistance. His father\r\nhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and\r\ngoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s nature to\r\nimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,\r\nand, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in\r\nLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\r\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\r\nlooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\r\nprospects a kind of common concern.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\r\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\r\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\r\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\r\n\r\nNow, upon his father\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\r\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not\r\na dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea\r\nwith Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the\r\nvisit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and\r\nthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his\r\nnew mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in\r\nHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had\r\nreceived. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank\r\nChurchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very\r\nhandsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw\r\nthe letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\r\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\r\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\r\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\r\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\r\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\r\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\r\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\r\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\r\n\r\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\r\npain, of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour\xe2\x80\x99s ennui,\r\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\r\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\r\nhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\r\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\r\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance\r\nof Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female\r\nwalking, and in Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s disposition and circumstances, which would\r\nmake the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the\r\nevenings in the week together.\r\n\r\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\r\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94her more\r\nthan satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\r\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\r\nat his being still able to pity \xe2\x80\x98poor Miss Taylor,\xe2\x80\x99 when they left her\r\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\r\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\r\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s giving a gentle sigh,\r\nand saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x94nor much likelihood of ceasing to\r\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\r\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\r\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\r\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could\r\nbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\r\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\r\nunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\r\nthem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\r\nearnestly tried to prevent any body\xe2\x80\x99s eating it. He had been at the\r\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\r\nPerry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were\r\none of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s life; and upon being applied to,\r\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\r\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\r\nmany\xe2\x80\x94perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\r\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\r\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\r\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\r\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\r\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\r\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\r\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\r\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own\r\nlittle circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\r\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\r\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance\r\nbut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,\r\nHighbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in\r\nthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many\r\nsuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion, he had some of the\r\nchosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he\r\npreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to\r\ncompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could\r\nnot make up a card-table for him.\r\n\r\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and\r\nby Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\r\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\r\nelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room, and the smiles\r\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\r\n\r\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\r\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\r\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\r\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\r\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\r\nwould have been a grievance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\r\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\r\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\r\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\r\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\r\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\r\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\r\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\r\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\r\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\r\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\r\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\r\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\r\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\r\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\r\nevery body, was interested in every body\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, quicksighted to\r\nevery body\xe2\x80\x99s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\r\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\r\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\r\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\r\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\r\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\r\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\r\ngossip.\r\n\r\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School\xe2\x80\x94not of a seminary, or an\r\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\r\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\r\nmorality, upon new principles and new systems\xe2\x80\x94and where young ladies\r\nfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity\xe2\x80\x94but a\r\nreal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\r\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\r\ngirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\r\na little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s school was in high repute\xe2\x80\x94and very deservedly; for Highbury\r\nwas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and\r\ngarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\r\na great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\r\nher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\r\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\r\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\r\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\r\nMr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\r\nneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\r\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\r\n\r\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\r\ncollect; and happy was she, for her father\xe2\x80\x99s sake, in the power;\r\nthough, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the\r\nabsence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look\r\ncomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things\r\nso well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that\r\nevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had\r\nfearfully anticipated.\r\n\r\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\r\npresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\r\nrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\r\nwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\r\nvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her\r\nbeauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\r\nlonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\r\n\r\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\r\nher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s school, and somebody had\r\nlately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\r\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\r\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\r\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\r\nladies who had been at school there with her.\r\n\r\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\r\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\r\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\r\ngreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much\r\npleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\r\ncontinue the acquaintance.\r\n\r\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk\xe2\x80\x94and yet so far from pushing,\r\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\r\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\r\nthe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\r\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\r\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\r\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\r\nHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\r\nwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\r\nvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\r\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a\r\nlarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell\xe2\x80\x94very\r\ncreditably, she believed\xe2\x80\x94she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\r\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and\r\nelegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve\r\nher; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\r\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It\r\nwould be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly\r\nbecoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\r\n\r\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\r\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\r\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\r\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\r\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to\r\nthe fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common\r\nimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of\r\ndoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\r\nmind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of\r\nthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped\r\noysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the\r\nearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.\r\n\r\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were in sad warfare.\r\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\r\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\r\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality\r\nwould have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their\r\nhealth made him grieve that they would eat.\r\n\r\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he\r\ncould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might\r\nconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer\r\nthings, to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\r\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\r\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\r\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\r\n_little_ bit of tart\xe2\x80\x94a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\r\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\r\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\r\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it\r\ncould disagree with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma allowed her father to talk\xe2\x80\x94but supplied her visitors in a much\r\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\r\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\r\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\r\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\r\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\r\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which\r\nMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken\r\nhands with her at last!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Smith\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\r\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\r\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance\r\nincreased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking\r\ncompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\r\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s loss had been important. Her father never\r\nwent beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\r\nhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\r\nventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\r\nSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\r\nwould be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\r\nas she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\r\nkind designs.\r\n\r\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\r\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\r\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\r\nvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\r\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\r\nof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\r\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith\xe2\x80\x99s being exactly the\r\nyoung friend she wanted\xe2\x80\x94exactly the something which her home required.\r\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\r\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\r\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\r\nthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\r\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.\r\nWeston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\r\n\r\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\r\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\r\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\r\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked\xe2\x80\x94but she could never believe that in\r\nthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\r\nhad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just\r\nwhat Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\r\n\r\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\r\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\r\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\r\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with\r\nthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\r\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\r\ntalkativeness\xe2\x80\x94amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and\r\nenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\r\nexultation of Mrs. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s having \xe2\x80\x9c_two_ parlours, two very good\r\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\r\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\r\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\r\ncow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s saying as she was so fond of it, it\r\nshould be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\r\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\r\ndrink tea:\xe2\x80\x94a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\r\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\r\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\r\ndaughter, a son and son\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who all lived together; but when it\r\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\r\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\r\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\r\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\r\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were\r\nnot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\r\n\r\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\r\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\r\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\r\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\r\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\r\ngood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\r\norder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was\r\nof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\r\nShe was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\r\nbelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\r\nfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\r\nwool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\r\nof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had\r\ntold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\r\nimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\r\nwhenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she\r\n_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Mrs. Martin!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what you are about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\r\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose\xe2\x80\x94the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\r\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\r\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\r\nhis own business? He does not read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x94that is, no\xe2\x80\x94I do not know\xe2\x80\x94but I believe he has read a good\r\ndeal\xe2\x80\x94but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\r\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\r\nwindow seats\xe2\x80\x94but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\r\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\r\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\r\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\r\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\r\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next question was\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! not handsome\xe2\x80\x94not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\r\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\r\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\r\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\r\nKingston. He has passed you very often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\r\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\r\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\r\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\r\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\r\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\r\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\r\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed\r\nhim; but he knows you very well indeed\xe2\x80\x94I mean by sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\r\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\r\nhis age to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\r\n23rd just a fortnight and a day\xe2\x80\x99s difference\xe2\x80\x94which is very odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\r\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\r\nthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\r\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\r\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\r\nmight be very desirable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\r\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\r\nentirely to make\xe2\x80\x94cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\r\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\r\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\r\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\r\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\r\nany thing yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\r\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\r\nof taking a boy another year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\r\nmarry;\xe2\x80\x94I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife\xe2\x80\x94for though his\r\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\r\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\r\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\r\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\r\nby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people\r\nwho would take pleasure in degrading you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\r\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\r\nbody can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\r\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\r\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you\r\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to\r\nhave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if\r\nyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you\r\nmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted\r\nwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nwithout education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\r\nbut what had had some education\xe2\x80\x94and been very well brought up. However,\r\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours\xe2\x80\x94and I am sure I shall\r\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\r\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\r\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\r\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\r\nvisit her, if I can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\r\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,\r\nbut she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no\r\nserious difficulty, on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s side, to oppose any friendly\r\narrangement of her own.\r\n\r\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\r\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\r\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\r\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\r\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\r\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\r\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\r\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\r\nthought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\r\nnoticed her father\xe2\x80\x99s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\r\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\r\n\r\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\r\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\r\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\r\ncompose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think of our happening to meet him!\xe2\x80\x94How very odd! It was quite a\r\nchance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\r\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\r\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\r\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot\r\nit, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!\r\nWell, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think\r\nof him? Do you think him so very plain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very plain, undoubtedly\xe2\x80\x94remarkably plain:\xe2\x80\x94but that is nothing\r\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\r\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\r\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\r\ndegree or two nearer gentility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \xe2\x80\x9che is not so genteel\r\nas real gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\r\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\r\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\r\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\r\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\r\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\r\ninferior creature\xe2\x80\x94and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\r\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\r\nWere not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\r\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\r\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air\r\nand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.\r\nBut Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\r\ncompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\r\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\r\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\r\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\r\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being\r\nsilent. You must see the difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x94there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\r\nman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\r\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\r\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\r\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\r\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s time of life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no saying, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harriet rather solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\r\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\r\nnothing but profit and loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he, indeed? That will be very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\r\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\r\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x94which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\r\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\r\nrich man in time\xe2\x80\x94and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\r\n_us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder he did not remember the book\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was all Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s answer, and\r\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\r\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\r\nnext beginning was,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s manners are superior to Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s or Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s. They have more gentleness. They might be\r\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\r\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\r\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it\xe2\x80\x94but that would not do to\r\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s downright, decided, commanding\r\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\r\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to\r\nset about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I\r\nthink a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as\r\na model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He\r\nseems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\r\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\r\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\r\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to\r\nplease you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from\r\nMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,\r\nand said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\r\n\r\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\r\nfarmer out of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s head. She thought it would be an excellent\r\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\r\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\r\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\r\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\r\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s coming to\r\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of\r\nits expediency. Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s situation was most suitable, quite the\r\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\r\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\r\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\r\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\r\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\r\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\r\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\r\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\r\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s there could be little\r\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\r\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\r\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned\r\nvery handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\r\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\r\nwith:\xe2\x80\x94but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin\xe2\x80\x99s riding\r\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered\r\nby Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nKnightley, \xe2\x80\x9cof this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but\r\nI think it a bad thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?\xe2\x80\x94why so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they will neither of them do the other any good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with\r\na new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have\r\nbeen seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very\r\ndifferently we feel!\xe2\x80\x94Not think they will do each other any good! This\r\nwill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\r\nKnightley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\r\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he\r\nthinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only\r\nyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there\r\nshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.\r\nKnightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You\r\nare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a\r\ncompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a\r\nwoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\r\nit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is\r\nnot the superior young woman which Emma\xe2\x80\x99s friend ought to be. But on\r\nthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an\r\ninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She\r\nmeans it, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years\r\nold. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\r\nof books that she meant to read regularly through\xe2\x80\x94and very good lists\r\nthey were\xe2\x80\x94very well chosen, and very neatly arranged\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\r\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up\r\nwhen only fourteen\xe2\x80\x94I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\r\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\r\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\r\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring\r\nindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\r\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\r\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.\xe2\x80\x94You never could persuade her\r\nto read half so much as you wished.\xe2\x80\x94You know you could not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I thought so\r\n_then_;\xe2\x80\x94but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma\xe2\x80\x99s omitting\r\nto do any thing I wished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said\r\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe soon added, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\r\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\r\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able\r\nto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was\r\nalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since\r\nshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In\r\nher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\r\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s family and wanted another\r\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\r\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are better placed _here_; very fit for a\r\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself\r\nto be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\r\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\r\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on\r\nthe very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\r\ndoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a\r\nwife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\r\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\r\nthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\r\nWe will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness\r\nof comfort, or his son may plague him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not _that_.\xe2\x80\x94It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\r\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\r\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nHarriet Smith\xe2\x80\x94I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\r\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\r\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\r\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\r\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\r\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\r\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_\r\ncannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of\r\nconceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just\r\nrefined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\r\ncircumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\r\nadapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x94They only give a little polish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI either depend more upon Emma\xe2\x80\x99s good sense than you do, or am more\r\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\r\nHow well she looked last night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\r\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma\xe2\x80\x99s being pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\r\nbeauty than Emma altogether\xe2\x80\x94face and figure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\r\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\r\nold friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an eye!\xe2\x80\x94the true hazle eye\xe2\x80\x94and so brilliant! regular features,\r\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\r\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\r\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\r\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being \xe2\x80\x98the picture of health;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\r\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not a fault to find with her person,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI think her\r\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\r\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\r\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\r\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\r\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\r\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma\xe2\x80\x99s little faults, she is an\r\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\r\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\r\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\r\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\r\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and\r\nIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind\r\naffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not\r\nquite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their\r\nopinions with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\r\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\r\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\r\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy being made a\r\nmatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\r\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\r\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\r\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\r\nsource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\r\ngive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this\r\nlittle remains of office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you for it. It is very\r\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\r\nfound; for it shall be attended to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\r\nher sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\r\nill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\r\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\r\nperhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\r\nfeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston gently, \xe2\x80\x9cvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\r\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\r\ncared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\r\nwith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\r\ndoubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\r\nto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her\r\nresolution at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cas can well be; and while\r\nshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any\r\nattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,\r\nthough I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\r\nand Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\r\nat Randalls respecting Emma\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, but it was not desirable to have\r\nthem suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\r\nafterwards made to \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Weston think of the weather; shall we\r\nhave rain?\xe2\x80\x9d convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise\r\nabout Hartfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s fancy a proper\r\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\r\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\r\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\r\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of\r\ncreating as much liking on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s side, as there could be any\r\noccasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s being in the\r\nfairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no\r\nscruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so\r\nwarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little\r\ntime would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of\r\nthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have given Miss Smith all that she required,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nmade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came\r\nto you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\r\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\r\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\r\nnatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\r\ndone very little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were admissible to contradict a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gallant Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\r\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\r\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\r\nmore truly amiable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of it.\xe2\x80\x9d And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\r\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\r\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\r\nto have Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\xe2\x80\x9d said she: \xe2\x80\x9cdid you\r\never sit for your picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\r\nwith a very interesting na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear, no, never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\r\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\r\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\r\npassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\r\nwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\r\nanother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\r\nif Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\r\npicture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me entreat you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Elton; \xe2\x80\x9cit would indeed be a delight!\r\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in\r\nfavour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you\r\nsuppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\r\nlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\r\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, good man!\xe2\x80\x94thought Emma\xe2\x80\x94but what has all that to do with taking\r\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be in\r\nraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if\r\nyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\r\nwhat I can do. Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s features are very delicate, which makes a\r\nlikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\r\neye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so\xe2\x80\x94The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nnot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\r\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\r\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of\r\nanswering me? How completely it meant, \xe2\x80\x98why should my picture be\r\ndrawn?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\r\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\r\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\r\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\r\ndirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\r\nattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\r\nthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\r\nbeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\r\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\r\nalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\r\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\r\nshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;\xe2\x80\x94and drew in almost every\r\nstyle; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she\r\napproached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to\r\ncommand, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as\r\nto her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\r\nunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\r\naccomplishment often higher than it deserved.\r\n\r\nThere was merit in every drawing\xe2\x80\x94in the least finished, perhaps the\r\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\r\nthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\r\ncompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A\r\nlikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s performances must be\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo great variety of faces for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cI had only my own\r\nfamily to study from. There is my father\xe2\x80\x94another of my father\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\r\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\r\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\r\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\r\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\r\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her\r\nfour children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\r\nattempts at three of those four children;\xe2\x80\x94there they are, Henry and\r\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\r\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\r\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\r\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\r\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\r\ncoarser featured than any of mama\xe2\x80\x99s children ever were. Here is my\r\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\r\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\r\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\r\nis very good. Then here is my last,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94unclosing a pretty sketch of a\r\ngentleman in small size, whole-length\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy last and my best\xe2\x80\x94my brother,\r\nMr. John Knightley.\xe2\x80\x94This did not want much of being finished, when I\r\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\r\ncould not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\r\nreally made a very good likeness of it\xe2\x80\x94(Mrs. Weston and I were quite\r\nagreed in thinking it _very_ like)\xe2\x80\x94only too handsome\xe2\x80\x94too flattering\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthat was a fault on the right side\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94after all this, came poor dear\r\nIsabella\xe2\x80\x99s cold approbation of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was a little like\xe2\x80\x94but to be\r\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\r\npersuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\r\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\r\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\r\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;\xe2\x80\x94and, as I said, I did then\r\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s sake, or rather\r\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\r\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and\r\nwas repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cNo husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\r\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\xe2\x80\x9d with so interesting a\r\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\r\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\r\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\r\n\r\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\r\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s, and was\r\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\r\nstation over the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\r\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\r\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\r\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\r\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\r\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\r\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\r\nto employ him in reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\r\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\r\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\r\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\r\nless would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\r\nat the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the\r\nprogress, and be charmed.\xe2\x80\x94There was no being displeased with such an\r\nencourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\r\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\r\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.\r\n\r\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\r\npleased with the first day\xe2\x80\x99s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\r\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\r\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\r\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\r\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\r\ndestined place with credit to them both\xe2\x80\x94a standing memorial of the\r\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\r\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s very promising\r\nattachment was likely to add.\r\n\r\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\r\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\r\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\r\npicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\r\nbut Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\r\nwanted,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94observed Mrs. Weston to him\xe2\x80\x94not in the least suspecting that\r\nshe was addressing a lover.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe expression of the eye is most correct,\r\nbut Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\r\nher face that she has them not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot agree with you. It appears to\r\nme a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\r\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made her too tall, Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley.\r\n\r\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\r\nadded,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,\r\nshe is sitting down\xe2\x80\x94which naturally presents a different\xe2\x80\x94which in short\r\ngives exactly the idea\xe2\x80\x94and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\r\nProportions, fore-shortening.\xe2\x80\x94Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\r\nsuch a height as Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x99s. Exactly so indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse. \xe2\x80\x9cSo prettily done! Just as\r\nyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\r\nwell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she\r\nseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\r\nshoulders\xe2\x80\x94and it makes one think she must catch cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\r\nLook at the tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, sir, may say any thing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Elton, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must confess\r\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\r\nof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any\r\nother situation would have been much less in character. The na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 of\r\nMiss Smith\xe2\x80\x99s manners\xe2\x80\x94and altogether\xe2\x80\x94Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot\r\nkeep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\r\nfew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\r\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose\r\ntaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all\r\ncommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.\r\nWoodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in\r\nthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.\r\nElton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should\r\nhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was\r\nimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\r\nsuch an errand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was too good!\xe2\x80\x94she could not endure the thought!\xe2\x80\x94she would not give\r\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94brought on the desired\r\nrepetition of entreaties and assurances,\xe2\x80\x94and a very few minutes settled\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\r\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\r\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\r\nnot being incommoded enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a precious deposit!\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a tender sigh, as he received\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man is almost too gallant to be in love,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\r\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\r\nexactly; it will be an \xe2\x80\x98Exactly so,\xe2\x80\x99 as he says himself; but he does\r\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\r\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\r\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very day of Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s going to London produced a fresh occasion\r\nfor Emma\xe2\x80\x99s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\r\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\r\nreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked\r\nof, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\r\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\r\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\r\nMrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\r\nfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\r\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\r\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs\r\nwhich she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this\r\nletter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal\r\nof marriage. \xe2\x80\x9cWho could have thought it? She was so surprized she did\r\nnot know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good\r\nletter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her\r\nvery much\xe2\x80\x94but she did not know\xe2\x80\x94and so, she was come as fast as she\r\ncould to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Emma was half-ashamed\r\nof her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe young man is determined not to lose any\r\nthing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you read the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cPray do. II\xe2\x80\x99d rather you\r\nwould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The\r\nstyle of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not\r\nmerely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have\r\ndisgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and\r\nunaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of\r\nthe writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,\r\nliberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,\r\nwhile Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x9d and was at last forced to add, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a good letter? or is it\r\ntoo short?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, a very good letter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma rather slowly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso good\r\na letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\r\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I\r\nsaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\r\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\r\nno, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\r\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\r\ntalent for\xe2\x80\x94thinks strongly and clearly\xe2\x80\x94and when he takes a pen in hand,\r\nhis thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,\r\nI understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a\r\ncertain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning\r\nit,) than I had expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the still waiting Harriet;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwell\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and what shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nspeedily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will\r\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your\r\nnot being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\r\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\r\nconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\r\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\r\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\r\ndisappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I ought to refuse him then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, looking down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\r\ndoubt as to that? I thought\xe2\x80\x94but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\r\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you\r\nfeel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you\r\nwere consulting me only as to the wording of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not; that is, I do not mean\xe2\x80\x94What shall I do? What would you\r\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\r\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no notion that he liked me so very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet,\r\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\r\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\r\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\r\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\r\nrefuse him. If she can hesitate as to \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she ought to say \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndirectly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\r\nfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\r\nolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I\r\nwant to influence you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to\xe2\x80\x94but if you would\r\njust advise me what I had best do\xe2\x80\x94No, no, I do not mean that\xe2\x80\x94As you\r\nsay, one\xe2\x80\x99s mind ought to be quite made up\xe2\x80\x94One should not be\r\nhesitating\xe2\x80\x94It is a very serious thing.\xe2\x80\x94It will be safer to say \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x94Do you think I had better say \xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, smiling graciously, \xe2\x80\x9cwould I advise you\r\neither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\r\nprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\r\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\r\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.\xe2\x80\x94Does any body else occur to you at this\r\nmoment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\r\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\r\nmoment whom are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe symptoms were favourable.\xe2\x80\x94Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\r\nconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\r\nstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without\r\nregard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong\r\nhopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as\r\nwell as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really\r\nalmost made up my mind\xe2\x80\x94to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\r\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\r\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\r\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have\r\ngrieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\r\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\r\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not\r\ninfluence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could\r\nnot have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am\r\nsecure of you for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\r\nforcibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not have visited me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, looking aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, to be\r\nsure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\r\nbeen too dreadful!\xe2\x80\x94What an escape!\xe2\x80\x94Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\r\ngive up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any\r\nthing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\r\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\r\nI must have given you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x94How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\r\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear affectionate creature!\xe2\x80\x94_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!\xe2\x80\x94_You_\r\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\r\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\r\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think he is conceited either, in general,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, her\r\nconscience opposing such censure; \xe2\x80\x9cat least, he is very good natured,\r\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94but that is quite a different thing from\xe2\x80\x94and you know, though he\r\nmay like me, it does not follow that I should\xe2\x80\x94and certainly I must\r\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people\xe2\x80\x94and if one comes\r\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\r\n_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\r\nMartin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\r\nhis being so much attached to me\xe2\x80\x94and his writing such a letter\xe2\x80\x94but as\r\nto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\r\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\r\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no;\xe2\x80\x94and it is but a short letter too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\r\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\r\nher husband could write a good letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\r\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\r\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\r\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\r\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\r\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\r\nsentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\r\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\r\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\r\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\r\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\r\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\r\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\r\naccepted after all.\r\n\r\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\r\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\r\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\r\nby speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\r\nidea of Mr. Elton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\xe2\x80\x9d was said in rather a\r\nsorrowful tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\r\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\r\nAbbey-Mill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\r\nbut at Hartfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards it was, \xe2\x80\x9cI think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\r\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\r\nlinen-draper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\r\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\r\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\r\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\r\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\r\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\r\nthe only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\r\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\r\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\r\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow he has got my letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said she softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what they are\r\nall doing\xe2\x80\x94whether his sisters know\xe2\x80\x94if he is unhappy, they will be\r\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\r\nemployed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\r\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\r\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\r\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy picture!\xe2\x80\x94But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he so!\xe2\x80\x94Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\r\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\r\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\r\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\r\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\r\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\r\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\r\ntheir imaginations all are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\r\nspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a\r\nbed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\r\nrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\r\njust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\r\ntwo to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, but it was then to be settled that she should\r\nreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\r\n\r\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\r\nWoodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\r\nmind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and\r\nwas induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of\r\nhis own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.\r\nKnightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his\r\nshort, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies\r\nand civil hesitations of the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\r\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma\xe2\x80\x99s advice and\r\ngo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\r\nbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\r\nMr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\r\nentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\r\nthree turns\xe2\x80\x94my winter walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot do better, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am\r\na very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides,\r\nyou have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\r\nthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open\r\nthe garden door for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\r\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\r\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\r\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot rate her beauty as you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is a pretty\r\nlittle creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\r\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\r\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\r\nwanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\r\nthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiggle; she really does you credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had\r\nbeen of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where\r\nthey may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\r\nintended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHighbury gossips!\xe2\x80\x94Tiresome wretches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\r\nnothing. He presently added, with a smile,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I\r\nhave good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\r\nsomething to her advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! how so? of what sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very serious sort, I assure you;\xe2\x80\x9d still smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery serious! I can think of but one thing\xe2\x80\x94Who is in love with her?\r\nWho makes you their confidant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s having dropt a hint.\r\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\r\nMr. Elton looked up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reason to think,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Harriet Smith will soon\r\nhave an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\r\nquarter:\xe2\x80\x94Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this\r\nsummer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and\r\nmeans to marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very obliging,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cbut is he sure that Harriet means to\r\nmarry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\r\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\r\nI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\r\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I\r\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\r\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\r\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\r\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\r\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\r\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\r\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\r\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\r\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\r\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\r\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\r\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\r\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\r\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\r\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\r\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not\r\nallow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\r\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be\r\nat Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without\r\nthinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Mr. Knightley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\r\nthrough a great part of this speech, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you know that Mr. Martin\r\ndid not speak yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, surprized, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not absolutely know it; but\r\nit may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you something, in return for what you\r\nhave told me. He did speak yesterday\xe2\x80\x94that is, he wrote, and was\r\nrefused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\r\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\r\nstood up, in tall indignation, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\r\nfoolish girl about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cit is always incomprehensible to a man\r\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\r\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\r\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\r\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her answer!\xe2\x80\x94nothing could be clearer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw her answer!\xe2\x80\x94you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\r\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\r\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\r\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s equal; and am rather surprized\r\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\r\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\r\ngot over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s equal!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\r\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he is not\r\nher equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\r\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\r\nHarriet Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\r\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\r\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\r\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\r\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\r\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\r\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\r\ncan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\r\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\r\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\r\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\r\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\r\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\r\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\r\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\r\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\r\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\r\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\r\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\r\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\r\nwould not regret your friend\xe2\x80\x99s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\r\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Even Emma, with\r\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\r\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\r\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\r\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\r\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\r\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\r\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\r\nYou are not just to Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s claims. They would be estimated very\r\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\r\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\r\nsociety.\xe2\x80\x94The sphere in which she moves is much above his.\xe2\x80\x94It would be a\r\ndegradation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\r\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\r\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\r\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\r\nwhom she is brought up.\xe2\x80\x94There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\r\nis a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94and a gentleman of fortune.\xe2\x80\x94Her allowance is very\r\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\r\ncomfort.\xe2\x80\x94That she is a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, is indubitable to me; that\r\nshe associates with gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\r\ndeny.\xe2\x80\x94She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever might be her parents,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever may have\r\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\r\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\r\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s hands to shift as she can;\xe2\x80\x94to move, in short, in Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s line, to have Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance. Her friends\r\nevidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\r\nShe desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a\r\nfriend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\r\nbeyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.\r\nShe had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given\r\nit. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would\r\nnever have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not\r\nbeing disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling\r\nto address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to\r\nconceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it\r\nhe had encouragement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\r\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\r\nunjust to Harriet. Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s claims to marry well are not so\r\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\r\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\r\nher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\r\nhowever, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\r\ngood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\r\nthey are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\r\nis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\r\npeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\r\nphilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\r\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\r\nfaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\r\nbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\r\namong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\r\nnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\r\nsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\r\ngreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\r\nmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\r\ntemper, the highest claims a woman could possess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\r\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\r\nit as you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she playfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI know _that_ is the feeling of you\r\nall. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man\r\ndelights in\xe2\x80\x94what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\r\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\r\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\r\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\r\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No\xe2\x80\x94pray let\r\nher have time to look about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley\r\npresently, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\r\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will\r\npuff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a\r\nclaim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good\r\nenough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of\r\nmischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations\r\ntoo high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so\r\nfast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may\r\nchuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very\r\nfond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity\xe2\x80\x94and most\r\nprudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they\r\nmight be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be\r\nrevealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable,\r\nand happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry\r\ngreatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of\r\nconsequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s all the rest of her life\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is\r\na girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and\r\nis glad to catch at the old writing-master\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\r\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\r\nangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is\r\nimpossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must\r\nprevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having\r\nrefused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will\r\nnot pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I\r\nassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His\r\nappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she\r\never were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that\r\nbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was\r\nthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and\r\naltogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great\r\nassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him\r\ndisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen\r\nare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\r\nwith Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr.\r\nKnightley.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRobert Martin\xe2\x80\x99s manners have sense, sincerity, and\r\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility\r\nthan Harriet Smith could understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\r\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\r\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\r\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\r\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\r\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\r\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\r\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\r\non Emma\xe2\x80\x99s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\r\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobert Martin has no great loss\xe2\x80\x94if he can but think so; and I hope it\r\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\r\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\r\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\r\nwill be all labour in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\r\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\r\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\r\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\r\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\r\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\r\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\r\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\r\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\r\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, laughing again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had\r\nset my heart on Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Harriet, it would have been very\r\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\r\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\r\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\r\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\r\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\r\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\r\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.\r\n\r\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\r\nindistinctness in the causes of her\xe2\x80\x99s, than in his. She did not always\r\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\r\nher opinions were right and her adversary\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\r\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\r\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\r\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\r\nof the young man\xe2\x80\x99s coming to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s that morning, and meeting\r\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\r\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\r\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\r\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\r\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\r\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s friendship and woman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings would not justify.\r\n\r\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\r\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\r\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\r\nof Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\r\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\r\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\r\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\r\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\r\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\r\ndisposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\r\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\r\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\r\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\r\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\r\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\r\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\r\nof prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\r\n\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\r\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\r\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\r\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s to attend a sick child,\r\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\r\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\r\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\r\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\r\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\r\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\r\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\r\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\r\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\r\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\r\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\r\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\r\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\r\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\r\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\r\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\r\nmore about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\r\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\r\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton\r\nhad not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\r\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual\r\nbefore he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave\r\nlooks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not\r\nrepent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more\r\njustified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\r\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half\r\nsentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and\r\nsteady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was\r\nsoon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s being no otherwise remembered,\r\nthan as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage\r\nto the latter.\r\n\r\nHer views of improving her little friend\xe2\x80\x99s mind, by a great deal of\r\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\r\nfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\r\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\r\nrange and work at Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\r\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\r\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\r\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\r\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\r\nquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\r\nciphers and trophies.\r\n\r\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\r\nnot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, had written\r\nout at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint\r\nof it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s help, to get a great many\r\nmore. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as\r\nHarriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of\r\nthe first order, in form as well as quantity.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\r\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\r\nin. \xe2\x80\x9cSo many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd it always ended in \xe2\x80\x9cKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did\r\nnot at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had\r\ndesired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\r\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s wish that the intellects of Highbury\r\nin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\r\nwhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really\r\ngood enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she\r\nhad the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his\r\nrecollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most\r\nearnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe\r\na compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their\r\ntwo or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at\r\nlast he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known\r\ncharade,\r\n\r\nMy first doth affliction denote,\r\n    Which my second is destin\xe2\x80\x99d to feel\r\nAnd my whole is the best antidote\r\n    That affliction to soften and heal.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\r\npages ago already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d said she;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\r\neasier to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\r\nlife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nstopt a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor Miss Smith could inspire him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called\r\nfor a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\r\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\r\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\r\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not offer it for Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x99s collection,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\r\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\r\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it\r\neasier to meet her eye than her friend\xe2\x80\x99s. He was gone the next\r\nmoment:\xe2\x80\x94after another moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is for you. Take your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\r\nloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\r\n\r\nTo Miss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\r\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\r\nAnother view of man, my second brings,\r\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\r\n\r\nBut ah! united, what reverse we have!\r\n    Man\xe2\x80\x99s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\r\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\r\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\r\n\r\n    Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\r\n    May its approval beam in that soft eye!\r\n\r\n\r\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\r\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\r\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\r\nwhile Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope\r\nand dulness, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\r\ncharades. _Courtship_\xe2\x80\x94a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\r\nis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Miss Smith,\r\ngive me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\r\nintentions in the same glance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMay its approval beam in that soft eye!\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye\xe2\x80\x94of all epithets, the\r\njustest that could be given.\r\n\r\nThy ready wit the word will soon supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nHumph\xe2\x80\x94Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\r\nlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\r\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\r\nyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\r\nindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\r\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\r\neagerness of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s wondering questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can it be, Miss Woodhouse?\xe2\x80\x94what can it be? I have not an idea\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\r\nit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is\r\nit kingdom? I wonder who the friend was\xe2\x80\x94and who could be the young\r\nlady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\r\n\r\nAnd woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan it be Neptune?\r\n\r\nBehold him there, the monarch of the seas!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\r\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\r\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\r\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a\r\nfriend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\r\n\r\nFor Miss \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, read Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nMy first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\r\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is _court_.\r\n\r\nAnother view of man, my second brings;\r\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is _ship_;\xe2\x80\x94plain as it can be.\xe2\x80\x94Now for the cream.\r\n\r\nBut ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\r\n    Man\xe2\x80\x99s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\r\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\r\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very proper compliment!\xe2\x80\x94and then follows the application, which I\r\nthink, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\r\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\r\nits being written for you and to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the\r\nconcluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\r\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\r\nEmma spoke for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s intentions. You\r\nare his object\xe2\x80\x94and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\r\nthought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now,\r\nit is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my\r\nwishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet,\r\njust so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that\r\nhas happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and\r\nMr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its\r\neligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I\r\ncongratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an\r\nattachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a\r\nconnexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing\r\nthat you want\xe2\x80\x94consideration, independence, a proper home\xe2\x80\x94it will fix\r\nyou in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to\r\nme, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance\r\nwhich can never raise a blush in either of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Woodhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d was all that Harriet,\r\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\r\narrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear\r\nto her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as\r\nshe ought. Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you say is always right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore I\r\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\r\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\r\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\r\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98To Miss \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDear me, how clever!\xe2\x80\x94Could it really be meant for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\r\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the\r\nplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\r\nmatter-of-fact prose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a\r\nmonth ago, I had no more idea myself!\xe2\x80\x94The strangest things do take\r\nplace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted\xe2\x80\x94they do indeed\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\r\nevidently, so palpably desirable\xe2\x80\x94what courts the pre-arrangement of\r\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\r\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\r\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\r\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\r\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\r\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\r\n\r\nThe course of true love never did run smooth\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\r\npassage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,\xe2\x80\x94me, of all people,\r\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\r\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\r\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\r\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\r\nthat he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\r\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\r\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\r\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!\xe2\x80\x94The two Abbots and\r\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\r\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\r\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look\r\ntoo, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\r\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an alliance which, whoever\xe2\x80\x94whatever your friends may be, must\r\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\r\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\r\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\r\nevery assurance of it;\xe2\x80\x94if they wish to have you settled in the same\r\ncountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\r\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\r\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\r\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\r\nunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\r\nother. This charade!\xe2\x80\x94If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have\r\nmade any thing like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as long again as almost all we have had before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\r\nthings in general cannot be too short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\r\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, presently\xe2\x80\x94her cheeks in a glow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto have\r\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\r\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\r\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch sweet lines!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Harriet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthese two last!\xe2\x80\x94But how shall I\r\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Miss\r\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\r\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\r\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.\xe2\x80\x94Your soft eyes shall\r\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\r\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\r\nnot write it into your book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but those two lines are\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe best of all. Granted;\xe2\x80\x94for private enjoyment; and for private\r\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\r\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\r\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\r\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\r\nupon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\r\nthan his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\r\nor neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\r\nbe no possible reflection on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\r\nas to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\r\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\r\nof publicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma; \xe2\x80\x9ca most natural feeling; and the longer it\r\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\r\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\r\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\r\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\r\ngallantry towards us all!\xe2\x80\x94You must let me read it to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet looked grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.\xe2\x80\x94You\r\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\r\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\r\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\r\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\r\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\r\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\r\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\r\nthis charade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x94I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\r\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dears, how does\r\nyour book go on?\xe2\x80\x94Have you got any thing fresh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\r\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning\xe2\x80\x94(dropt, we suppose,\r\nby a fairy)\xe2\x80\x94containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\r\nit in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\r\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\r\npart as she proceeded\xe2\x80\x94and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\r\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that\xe2\x80\x99s very just, indeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s very properly said. Very true.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Woman, lovely woman.\xe2\x80\x99 It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\r\neasily guess what fairy brought it.\xe2\x80\x94Nobody could have written so\r\nprettily, but you, Emma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.\xe2\x80\x94After a little thinking, and a very\r\ntender sigh, he added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\r\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\r\nremember nothing;\xe2\x80\x94not even that particular riddle which you have heard\r\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\r\nseveral.\r\n\r\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\r\n    Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\r\nThe hood-wink\xe2\x80\x99d boy I called to aid,\r\nThough of his near approach afraid,\r\n    So fatal to my suit before.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it\xe2\x80\x94but it is very clever all\r\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\r\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick\xe2\x80\x99s, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, very true.\xe2\x80\x94I wish I could recollect more of it.\r\n\r\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\r\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\r\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her\xe2\x80\x94and what\r\nroom there will be for the children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes\xe2\x80\x94she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\r\nhas;\xe2\x80\x94and there is the nursery for the children,\xe2\x80\x94just as usual, you\r\nknow. Why should there be any change?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, my dear\xe2\x80\x94but it is so long since she was here!\xe2\x80\x94not since\r\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. John Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s being a\r\nlawyer is very inconvenient.\xe2\x80\x94Poor Isabella!\xe2\x80\x94she is sadly taken away\r\nfrom us all!\xe2\x80\x94and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\r\nTaylor here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not be surprized, papa, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\r\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, if there is time.\xe2\x80\x94But\xe2\x80\x94(in a very depressed tone)\xe2\x80\x94she is\r\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer\xe2\x80\x94but it seems a case of\r\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\r\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\r\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\r\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\r\nthis Christmas\xe2\x80\x94though you know it is longer since they were with him,\r\nthan with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\r\nanywhere but at Hartfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s claims on his\r\nbrother, or any body\xe2\x80\x99s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\r\nmusing a little while, and then said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\r\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\r\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! papa\xe2\x80\x94that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\r\nnot think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\r\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\r\nby the idea of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s attachment to her husband, she\r\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\r\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\r\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\r\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\r\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\r\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\r\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\r\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\r\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\r\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\r\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, \xe2\x80\x98Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\r\nof string?\xe2\x80\x99 and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\r\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\r\nthem very often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe appears rough to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you are so very gentle\r\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\r\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\r\nmisbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\r\naffectionate father\xe2\x80\x94certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\r\nfather. The children are all fond of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\r\nvery frightful way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\r\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\r\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I cannot understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\r\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\r\npreparation for the regular four o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner, the hero of this\r\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\r\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\r\nhis the consciousness of having made a push\xe2\x80\x94of having thrown a die; and\r\nshe imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\r\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s party could be made\r\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\r\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\r\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\r\ndining with him\xe2\x80\x94had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\r\nconditionally to come.\r\n\r\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\r\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\r\npaper from the table, she returned it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\r\nthank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\r\nventured to write it into Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x99s collection. Your friend will not\r\ntake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\r\neight lines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\r\nrather doubtingly\xe2\x80\x94rather confused; said something about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chonour,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open\r\non the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the\r\nview of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\r\nnot be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no hesitation in saying,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\r\na good deal while he spoke; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no hesitation in saying\xe2\x80\x94at least if\r\nmy friend feels at all as _I_ do\xe2\x80\x94I have not the smallest doubt that,\r\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at\r\nthe book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as\r\nthe proudest moment of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\r\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a\r\nsort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\r\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\r\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\r\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\r\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\r\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\r\n\r\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\r\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\r\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\r\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\r\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\r\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\r\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\r\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\r\neyes.\xe2\x80\x94Emma\xe2\x80\x99s remark was\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s was\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a sweet house!\xe2\x80\x94How very beautiful!\xe2\x80\x94There are the yellow\r\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not often walk this way _now_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, as they proceeded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\r\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\r\nthis part of Highbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\r\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\r\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s seeing ready wit in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could contrive it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot think of any\r\ntolerable pretence for going in;\xe2\x80\x94no servant that I want to inquire\r\nabout of his housekeeper\xe2\x80\x94no message from my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\r\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\r\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nEmma laughed, and replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\r\nI must find other people charming\xe2\x80\x94one other person at least. And I am\r\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\r\nintention of ever marrying at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94so you say; but I cannot believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\r\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\r\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\r\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\r\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x94it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\r\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\r\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\r\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\r\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\r\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\r\nmistress of their husband\xe2\x80\x99s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\r\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\r\nfirst and always right in any man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as I am in my father\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\r\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly\xe2\x80\x94so satisfied\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nsmiling\xe2\x80\x94so prosing\xe2\x80\x94so undistinguishing and unfastidious\xe2\x80\x94and so apt to\r\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\r\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\r\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still, you will be an old maid! and that\xe2\x80\x99s so dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\r\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\r\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\r\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\r\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\r\npleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\r\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\r\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\r\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\r\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\r\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\r\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\r\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\r\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\r\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\r\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\r\ngrow old?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\r\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\r\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\r\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\r\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\r\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\r\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\r\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\r\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\r\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\r\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\r\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\r\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\r\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!\xe2\x80\x94I shall often have a niece with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\r\na hundred times\xe2\x80\x94but are you acquainted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\r\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\r\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\r\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\r\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\r\nfrom her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\r\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\r\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\r\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\r\ntires me to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\r\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\r\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\r\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\r\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\r\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\r\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\r\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\r\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\r\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\r\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\r\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\r\nevery thing else appear!\xe2\x80\x94I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\r\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\r\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor creatures! one can think of nothing\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\r\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\r\ninto the lane again. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think it will,\xe2\x80\x9d stopping to look once\r\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\r\ngreater within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion.\r\n\r\nThey walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\r\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\r\ntime only to say farther,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\r\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\r\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\r\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we\r\ncan for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to\r\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet could just answer, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d before the gentleman joined\r\nthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\r\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\r\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what\r\ncould be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\r\naccompany them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Emma;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of\r\nlove on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\r\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\r\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\r\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\r\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s habits of\r\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\r\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\r\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\r\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\r\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\r\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\r\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\r\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\r\nthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\r\nfetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\r\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\r\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\r\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\r\nwithout any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\r\ninvoluntarily: the child\xe2\x80\x99s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\r\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\r\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\r\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\r\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\r\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\r\nto join them.\r\n\r\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\r\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was\r\nonly giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s party at\r\nhis friend Cole\xe2\x80\x99s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\r\ncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and\r\nall the dessert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis would soon have led to something better, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d was her\r\nconsoling reflection; \xe2\x80\x9cany thing interests between those who love; and\r\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\r\ncould but have kept longer away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\r\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\r\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\r\nand fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off\r\nshort, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged\r\nto entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself\r\nto rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPart of my lace is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I do not know how I am to\r\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\r\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\r\nstop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or\r\nstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\r\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house\r\nand endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they\r\nwere taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\r\nbehind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\r\nbetween them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to\r\nreceive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\r\nto leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\r\nElton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\r\najar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\r\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\r\nadjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\r\ncould be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and\r\nmake her appearance.\r\n\r\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\r\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\r\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\r\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\r\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\r\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCautious, very cautious,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Emma; \xe2\x80\x9che advances inch by inch, and\r\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\r\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\r\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\r\nthem forward to the great event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s power\r\nto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\r\nand then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\r\nand during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\r\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94she did not herself expect\xe2\x80\x94that any thing beyond occasional,\r\nfortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They\r\nmight advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow\r\nor other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more\r\nleisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the\r\nless they will do for themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\r\nfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual\r\ninterest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had\r\nbeen divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays\r\nof this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it\r\nwas therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by\r\ntheir Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not\r\nbe induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s sake; and\r\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\r\nforestalling this too short visit.\r\n\r\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\r\nof the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\r\nof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\r\nthe sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\r\nKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of\r\nnursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of\r\nsuch an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and\r\nvariously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion\r\nwhich his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\r\nendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the\r\nfeelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that\r\nin spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her\r\nlittle ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and\r\nattendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\r\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the\r\nchildren were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in\r\nthemselves or in any restless attendance on them.\r\n\r\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\r\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\r\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so\r\ntenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher\r\nties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a\r\nfault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or\r\nany quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited\r\nalso much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,\r\nover-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,\r\nand was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\r\nof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,\r\nand a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\r\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\r\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\r\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He\r\nwas not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to\r\ndeserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;\r\nand, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that\r\nany natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme\r\nsweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and\r\nquickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an\r\nungracious, or say a severe thing.\r\n\r\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\r\nin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\r\nIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\r\npassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\r\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\r\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\r\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all\r\nin her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\r\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\r\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities and\r\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\r\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.\r\nJohn Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and\r\ngenerally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often\r\nfor Emma\xe2\x80\x99s charity, especially as there was all the pain of\r\napprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The\r\nbeginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest\r\nfeelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass\r\naway in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and\r\ncomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a\r\nsigh, called his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the sad change at Hartfield\r\nsince she had been there last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x94It is a grievous business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she with ready sympathy, \xe2\x80\x9chow you must miss her!\r\nAnd dear Emma, too!\xe2\x80\x94What a dreadful loss to you both!\xe2\x80\x94I have been so\r\ngrieved for you.\xe2\x80\x94I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x94It is a sad change indeed.\xe2\x80\x94But I hope she is pretty well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, my dear\xe2\x80\x94I hope\xe2\x80\x94pretty well.\xe2\x80\x94I do not know but that the\r\nplace agrees with her tolerably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\r\ndoubts of the air of Randalls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x94none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much to the honour of both,\xe2\x80\x9d was the handsome reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Isabella in the\r\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNot near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\r\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\r\nhave we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\r\neither at Randalls or here\xe2\x80\x94and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\r\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\r\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy\r\nway, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body\r\nmust be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought\r\nalso to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our\r\nmissing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nis the exact truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. John Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cand just as I hoped\r\nit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not\r\nbe doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\r\neasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\r\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\r\nnow you have Emma\xe2\x80\x99s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyes, certainly\xe2\x80\x94I cannot deny\r\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\r\noften\xe2\x80\x94but then\xe2\x80\x94she is always obliged to go away again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.\xe2\x80\x94You quite\r\nforget poor Mr. Weston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Knightley pleasantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Weston has\r\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\r\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\r\nclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\r\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\r\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you talking about me?\xe2\x80\x94I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\r\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\r\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\r\nMiss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\r\nslighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\r\nnothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\r\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\r\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\r\nflying Henry\xe2\x80\x99s kite for him that very windy day last Easter\xe2\x80\x94and ever\r\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\r\nthat note, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\r\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\r\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.\xe2\x80\x94If any body\r\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the young man?\xe2\x80\x9d said John Knightley. \xe2\x80\x9cHas he been here on\r\nthis occasion\xe2\x80\x94or has he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not been here yet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a strong\r\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\r\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nwrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\r\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\r\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\r\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree-and-twenty!\xe2\x80\x94is he indeed?\xe2\x80\x94Well, I could not have thought it\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\r\nfly indeed!\xe2\x80\x94and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\r\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\r\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\r\n28th\xe2\x80\x94and began, \xe2\x80\x98My dear Madam,\xe2\x80\x99 but I forget how it went on; and it\r\nwas signed \xe2\x80\x98F. C. Weston Churchill.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I remember that perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very pleasing and proper of him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\r\nKnightley. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\r\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\r\nsomething so shocking in a child\xe2\x80\x99s being taken away from his parents\r\nand natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\r\nwith him. To give up one\xe2\x80\x99s child! I really never could think well of\r\nany body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr.\r\nJohn Knightley coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\r\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\r\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\r\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\r\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\r\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\r\nplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\r\naffection, or any thing that home affords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and\r\nhad half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\r\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable\r\nand valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home\r\nto himself, whence resulted her brother\xe2\x80\x99s disposition to look down on\r\nthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\r\nimportant.\xe2\x80\x94It had a high claim to forbearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them\xe2\x80\x94rather against the inclination of\r\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\r\nIsabella\xe2\x80\x99s first day. Emma\xe2\x80\x99s sense of right however had decided it; and\r\nbesides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\r\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\r\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\r\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\r\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\r\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\r\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration\r\nof friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the\r\nchildren with her\xe2\x80\x94the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months\r\nold, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to\r\nbe danced about in her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s arms. It did assist; for though he began\r\nwith grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of\r\nthem all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with\r\nall the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends\r\nagain; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and\r\nthen a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring\r\nthe baby,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and\r\nnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\r\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and\r\nwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings\r\nwith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might\r\nalways think alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure\xe2\x80\x94our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand reason good. I was sixteen years old when\r\nyou were born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA material difference then,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand no doubt you were much\r\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\r\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\r\nnearer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94a good deal _nearer_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\r\nthink differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have still the advantage of you by sixteen years\xe2\x80\x99 experience, and by\r\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\r\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\r\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\r\nold grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvery true. Little Emma, grow up a better\r\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\r\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\r\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects\r\non my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know\r\nthat Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man cannot be more so,\xe2\x80\x9d was his short, full answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94Indeed I am very sorry.\xe2\x80\x94Come, shake hands with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\r\nKnightley made his appearance, and \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, George?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\r\nhow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\r\ncalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which\r\nwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the\r\ngood of the other.\r\n\r\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\r\nentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\r\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\r\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\r\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing\xe2\x80\x94and Emma only occasionally joining in\r\none or the other.\r\n\r\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\r\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\r\nand who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had\r\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some\r\ncurious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\r\nhome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\r\nyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\r\ninteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\r\npart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\r\ndrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\r\ndestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\r\nentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\r\nmanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\r\nthing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\r\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear Isabella,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, fondly taking her hand, and\r\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\r\nfive children\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\r\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\r\nmy dear\xe2\x80\x94and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.\xe2\x80\x94You and I\r\nwill have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\r\nhave a little gruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both\r\nthe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as\r\nherself;\xe2\x80\x94and two basins only were ordered. After a little more\r\ndiscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being\r\ntaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of\r\ngrave reflection,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\r\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir\xe2\x80\x94or we should not\r\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\r\nthe weakness in little Bella\xe2\x80\x99s throat,\xe2\x80\x94both sea air and bathing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\r\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\r\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\r\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\r\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet;\r\nand he never forgets you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! good Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x94how is he, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he\r\nhas not time to take care of himself\xe2\x80\x94he tells me he has not time to\r\ntake care of himself\xe2\x80\x94which is very sad\xe2\x80\x94but he is always wanted all\r\nround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice\r\nanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I\r\nhave a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\r\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\r\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\r\nyou had better let him look at little Bella\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\r\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\r\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\r\nWingfield\xe2\x80\x99s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\r\nto her\xe2\x80\x94and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\r\nspoken to\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the good Bateses\xe2\x80\x94I am quite ashamed of myself\xe2\x80\x94but you mention them\r\nin most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\r\nBates\xe2\x80\x94I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.\xe2\x80\x94They are\r\nalways so pleased to see my children.\xe2\x80\x94And that excellent Miss\r\nBates!\xe2\x80\x94such thorough worthy people!\xe2\x80\x94How are they, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\r\nbad cold about a month ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\r\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\r\ngeneral or heavy\xe2\x80\x94except when it has been quite an influenza.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\r\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\r\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\r\naltogether a sickly season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\r\nexcept\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\r\nsickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\r\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nair so bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed\xe2\x80\x94_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\r\nvery superior to most others!\xe2\x80\x94You must not confound us with London in\r\ngeneral, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\r\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\r\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;\xe2\x80\x94there is\r\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but\r\n_we_ are so remarkably airy!\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\r\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\r\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I\r\nthink you are any of you looking well at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\r\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\r\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\r\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\r\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\r\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\r\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\r\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you\r\ndo not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\xe2\x80\x9d turning her eyes with\r\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiddling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\r\nvery far from looking well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, sir?\xe2\x80\x94Did you speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. John\r\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\r\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\r\nyou left home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Isabella,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94exclaimed he hastily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpray do not concern yourself\r\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\r\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cabout your friend Mr. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s intending to have a bailiff\r\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\r\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\r\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\r\nworse to hear than Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\r\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\r\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. John Knightley.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so\r\nlong since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\r\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\r\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\r\nregret excessively on dear Emma\xe2\x80\x99s account that she cannot be more at\r\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\r\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\r\ndelightful companion for Emma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\r\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\r\nbetter companion than Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am most happy to hear it\xe2\x80\x94but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\r\nvery accomplished and superior!\xe2\x80\x94and exactly Emma\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\r\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\r\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\r\na great deal to be said\xe2\x80\x94much praise and many comments\xe2\x80\x94undoubting\r\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\r\nPhilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\r\ntolerably;\xe2\x80\x94but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\r\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\r\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\r\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\r\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\r\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\r\ndangerous opening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\r\nwith tender concern.\xe2\x80\x94The ejaculation in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s ear expressed, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\r\ndoes not bear talking of.\xe2\x80\x9d And for a little while she hoped he would\r\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\r\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\r\nminutes, however, he began with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\r\ninstead of coming here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you be sorry, sir?\xe2\x80\x94I assure you, it did the children a\r\ngreat deal of good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\r\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\r\nhear you had fixed upon South End.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\r\na mistake, sir.\xe2\x80\x94We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\r\nthe least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\r\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\r\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\r\nand his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.\xe2\x80\x94Perry\r\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\r\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\r\nby what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\r\nthe sea\xe2\x80\x94a quarter of a mile off\xe2\x80\x94very comfortable. You should have\r\nconsulted Perry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;\xe2\x80\x94only consider how\r\ngreat it would have been.\xe2\x80\x94An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\r\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\r\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.\xe2\x80\x94Better not move at all,\r\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\r\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\r\nill-judged measure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\r\nreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\r\nbrother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s breaking out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Perry,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \xe2\x80\x9cwould do\r\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\r\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?\xe2\x80\x94at my taking my family to\r\none part of the coast or another?\xe2\x80\x94I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\r\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.\xe2\x80\x94I want his directions no more than\r\nhis drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused\xe2\x80\x94and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\r\nsarcastic dryness, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\r\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\r\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\r\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\ntrue. That\xe2\x80\x99s a consideration indeed.\xe2\x80\x94But John, as to what I was telling\r\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\r\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\r\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\r\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\r\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\r\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\r\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\r\nyour opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\r\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\r\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;\xe2\x80\x94but the soothing\r\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the\r\nimmediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\r\nother, prevented any renewal of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\r\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\r\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over\r\nwhat she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had\r\nnothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.\r\nIt was a delightful visit;\xe2\x80\x94perfect, in being much too short.\r\n\r\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\r\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\r\nthere was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\r\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;\xe2\x80\x94even Mr. Woodhouse was\r\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\r\ncould, but as his son and daughter\xe2\x80\x99s carriage and horses were actually\r\nat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\r\nthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\r\nto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\r\nHarriet also.\r\n\r\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\r\nonly persons invited to meet them;\xe2\x80\x94the hours were to be early, as well\r\nas the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s habits and inclination being\r\nconsulted in every thing.\r\n\r\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\r\nMr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\r\nby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\r\na cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\r\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma\r\ncalled on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with\r\nregard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:\r\nMrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,\r\nand Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which\r\nexcluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not\r\nspeak of her loss without many tears.\r\n\r\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\r\nMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at\r\nlast tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a\r\nmost comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had\r\nnot advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s door, when she was met by\r\nMr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on\r\nslowly together in conversation about the invalid\xe2\x80\x94of whom he, on the\r\nrumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he\r\nmight carry some report of her to Hartfield\xe2\x80\x94they were overtaken by Mr.\r\nJohn Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two\r\neldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a\r\ncountry run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton\r\nand rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\r\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplaint;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\r\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\r\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\r\nalarmed her with them.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\r\nhe exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sore-throat!\xe2\x80\x94I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\r\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\r\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\r\nWhy does not Perry see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\r\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s experience and\r\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\r\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\r\nthan not, she added soon afterwards\xe2\x80\x94as if quite another subject,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so cold, so very cold\xe2\x80\x94and looks and feels so very much like\r\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\r\nshould really try not to go out to-day\xe2\x80\x94and dissuade my father from\r\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel\r\nthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\r\ngreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\r\nElton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\r\na little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\r\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\r\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\r\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\r\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;\xe2\x80\x94but Emma,\r\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear\r\nhim impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied\r\nwith his muttering acknowledgment of its being \xe2\x80\x9cvery cold, certainly\r\nvery cold,\xe2\x80\x9d and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from\r\nRandalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet\r\nevery hour of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said she;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe will make your apologies to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Weston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\r\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\r\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\r\nhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\r\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\r\nhe next looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is most strange!\xe2\x80\x94After I had got him\r\noff so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\r\nbehind!\xe2\x80\x94Most strange indeed!\xe2\x80\x94But there is, I believe, in many men,\r\nespecially single men, such an inclination\xe2\x80\x94such a passion for dining\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\r\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing\r\ngives way to it\xe2\x80\x94and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\r\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in\r\nlove with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must\r\ndine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see\r\nready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\r\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\r\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\r\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s for news of her fair\r\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\r\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he\r\nsighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\r\napprobation much in his favour.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\r\nbegan with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\r\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\r\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\r\nplease, every feature works.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s manners are not perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cbut where there\r\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\r\ngreat deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\r\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\r\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\r\nvalue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \xe2\x80\x9che seems\r\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a smile of astonishment, \xe2\x80\x9care you imagining me\r\nto be Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\r\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton in love with me!\xe2\x80\x94What an idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\r\nso or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\r\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\r\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\r\nare very good friends, and nothing more;\xe2\x80\x9d and she walked on, amusing\r\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\r\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\r\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\r\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\r\nin want of counsel. He said no more.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\r\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\r\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\r\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\r\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\r\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\r\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\r\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\r\nof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\r\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\r\nwhite world in a very short time.\r\n\r\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\r\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\r\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\r\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\r\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\r\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmust have a very good opinion of himself when he\r\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\r\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\r\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\r\nabsurdity\xe2\x80\x94Actually snowing at this moment!\xe2\x80\x94The folly of not allowing\r\npeople to be comfortable at home\xe2\x80\x94and the folly of people\xe2\x80\x99s not staying\r\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\r\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\r\nshould deem it;\xe2\x80\x94and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\r\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\r\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\r\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\r\nthat he can;\xe2\x80\x94here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\r\nanother man\xe2\x80\x99s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\r\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\r\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;\xe2\x80\x94four horses and\r\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\r\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\r\nat home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\r\ndoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \xe2\x80\x9cVery true, my\r\nlove,\xe2\x80\x9d which must have been usually administered by his travelling\r\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any\r\nanswer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\r\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\r\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.\r\nElton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma\r\nthought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all\r\nobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\r\nindeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\r\naccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while\r\ndressing, and the answer had been, \xe2\x80\x9cMuch the same\xe2\x80\x94not better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said she presently, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not so\r\npleasant as I had hoped\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Not better\xe2\x80\x99 was _my_ answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\r\nsentiment as he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x94I am grieved to find\xe2\x80\x94I was on the point of telling you that\r\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s door, which I did the very last thing\r\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\r\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned\xe2\x80\x94I had\r\nflattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew\r\nhad been given her in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma smiled and answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy visit was of use to the nervous part of\r\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it\r\nis a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\r\nprobably heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I imagined\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94I did not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\r\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\r\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party\r\nto-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful!\xe2\x80\x94Exactly so, indeed.\xe2\x80\x94She will be missed every moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\r\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\r\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\r\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an excellent device,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of a sheepskin for\r\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;\xe2\x80\x94impossible to feel cold\r\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\r\nrendered a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\r\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\r\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\r\ncold afternoon\xe2\x80\x94but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.\xe2\x80\x94Ha!\r\nsnows a little I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think we shall have a good deal of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristmas weather,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Elton. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite seasonable; and\r\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\r\nyesterday, and prevent this day\xe2\x80\x99s party, which it might very possibly\r\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\r\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\r\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\r\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\r\nworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house once for a week.\r\nNothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\r\nget away till that very day se\xe2\x80\x99nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\r\nsaid only, coolly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\r\nastonished now at Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s spirits for other feelings. Harriet\r\nseemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are sure of excellent fires,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cand every thing in the\r\ngreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston\r\nindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\r\nhospitable, and so fond of society;\xe2\x80\x94it will be a small party, but where\r\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\r\nMr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten\r\ncomfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,\r\nfall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,\r\n(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your\r\napprobation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large\r\nparties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of the large parties of London, sir\xe2\x80\x94I never dine with\r\nany body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\r\nbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be\r\npaid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\r\nenjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first enjoyment,\xe2\x80\x9d replied John Knightley, as they passed through\r\nthe sweep-gate, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\r\nwalked into Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room;\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton must compose his\r\njoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton\r\nmust smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x94Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\r\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\r\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\r\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\r\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\r\nunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\r\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\r\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\r\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s uninterrupted\r\ncommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\r\nof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\r\n\r\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day\xe2\x80\x99s visit might not\r\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\r\nthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\r\ngrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\r\nMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\r\nthat was enjoyable to the utmost.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s cold had been pretty well gone through\r\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to\r\ngive the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\r\nIsabella\xe2\x80\x99s coming, and of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s being to follow, and had indeed just\r\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\r\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\r\nalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\r\nand welcome her dear Emma.\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\r\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\r\nto her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility\r\ntowards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\r\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\r\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\r\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\r\nsuggestion of \xe2\x80\x9cCan it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\r\npossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\r\nHarriet to me?\xe2\x80\x94Absurd and insufferable!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Yet he would be so anxious for\r\nher being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and\r\nso delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\r\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\r\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\r\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\r\npositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\r\ngoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard\r\nenough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his\r\nson; she heard the words \xe2\x80\x9cmy son,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFrank,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmy son,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\r\nseveral times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much\r\nsuspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but\r\nbefore she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past\r\nthat any reviving question from her would have been awkward.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of never\r\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\r\nChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94especially since his father\xe2\x80\x99s marriage with Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x94that if\r\nshe _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\r\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\r\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\r\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\r\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\r\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\r\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\r\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\r\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\r\ntheir friends\xe2\x80\x99 imaginations.\r\n\r\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\r\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\r\ncross\xe2\x80\x94and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\r\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\r\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.\xe2\x80\x94So it proved;\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\r\ndinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\r\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\r\nto her,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\r\nsee two more here,\xe2\x80\x94your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\r\nhear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting\r\nFrank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us\r\nwithin a fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\r\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\r\nparty quite complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been wanting to come to us,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cever since\r\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\r\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\r\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\r\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\r\nJanuary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\r\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\r\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\r\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is\xe2\x80\x94(but this is\r\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the\r\nother room. There are secrets in all families, you know)\xe2\x80\x94The case is,\r\nthat a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\r\nJanuary; and that Frank\xe2\x80\x99s coming depends upon their being put off. If\r\nthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\r\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\r\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\r\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\r\nto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\r\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\r\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\r\nupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\r\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\r\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nEmma; \xe2\x80\x9cbut am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\r\nwill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\r\nthe place in my life.\xe2\x80\x94She is an odd woman!\xe2\x80\x94But I never allow myself to\r\nspeak ill of her, on Frank\xe2\x80\x99s account; for I do believe her to be very\r\nfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any\r\nbody, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\r\nto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\r\nthat he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it\r\nto any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\r\ngeneral; and the devil of a temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\r\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy\xe2\x80\x94yet\r\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\r\nsecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\r\nof: \xe2\x80\x9cfor I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\r\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\r\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter\r\nstands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\r\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Emma!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the certainty of\r\ncaprice?\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\r\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\r\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s spirits and pleasure; in\r\nshort, upon her temper. To you\xe2\x80\x94to my two daughters\xe2\x80\x94I may venture on the\r\ntruth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\r\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nIsabella: \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\r\nthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\r\nperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any\r\nthing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she\r\nnever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\r\nhave made them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\r\nheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\r\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\r\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from\r\nher, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\r\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\r\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\r\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,\r\nwas a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\r\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\r\nwhom he was always comfortable.\r\n\r\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\r\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\r\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\r\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\r\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\r\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\r\nChurchills\xe2\x80\x99 to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\r\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\r\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he could stay only a couple of days,\r\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man\xe2\x80\x99s not having\r\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\r\ninto bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\r\nwants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_\xe2\x80\x99s being under\r\nsuch restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\r\nhe likes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\r\none decides upon what he can do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cOne ought to\r\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\r\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\r\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\r\nevery thing gives way to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\r\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\r\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\r\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\r\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\r\nshe owes nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\r\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\r\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\r\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be satisfied, unless\r\nhe comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have a great deal of influence on some points,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs.\r\nWeston, \xe2\x80\x9cand on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\r\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance\r\nof his coming away from them to visit us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea\r\nhe was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\r\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\r\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty\r\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\r\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\r\nvery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and\r\nEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\r\nwith scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\r\n\r\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\r\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\r\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\r\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\r\nfriendly smiles.\r\n\r\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend\xe2\x80\x94her fair,\r\nlovely, amiable friend. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she know?\xe2\x80\x94had she heard any thing about\r\nher, since their being at Randalls?\xe2\x80\x94he felt much anxiety\xe2\x80\x94he must\r\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nin this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\r\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\r\nterror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\r\n\r\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\r\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\r\non Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\r\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\r\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\r\nagain, for the present\xe2\x80\x94to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\r\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\r\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\r\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\r\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear\xe2\x80\x94there was no concealing\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\r\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\r\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\r\nWeston to implore her assistance, \xe2\x80\x9cWould not she give him her\r\nsupport?\xe2\x80\x94would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss\r\nWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s till it were certain that Miss\r\nSmith\xe2\x80\x99s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\r\npromise\xe2\x80\x94would not she give him her influence in procuring it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo scrupulous for others,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet so careless for\r\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\r\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\r\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?\xe2\x80\x94Judge between us. Have not I\r\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\r\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right\r\nof first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked\r\nand offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the\r\npurpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she\r\nthought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,\r\nremoving to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\r\n\r\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\r\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\r\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\r\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,\r\nwith a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\r\nWoodhouse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.\r\nSomething new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\r\nthrough a storm of snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\r\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\r\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and\r\nEmma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\r\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admired your resolution very much, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cin venturing out\r\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\r\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;\r\nand I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two\xe2\x80\x99s snow\r\ncan hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one\r\nis blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the\r\nother at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\r\nmidnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\r\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\r\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\r\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\r\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\r\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\r\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\r\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\r\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\r\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\r\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done, my dear Emma?\xe2\x80\x94what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr.\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\r\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\r\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\r\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\r\n\r\nHis eldest daughter\xe2\x80\x99s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\r\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\r\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\r\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\r\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\r\nRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\r\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better order the carriage directly, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\r\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\r\nall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\r\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\r\nthat gives me cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, my dear Isabella, it is the most\r\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\r\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!\xe2\x80\x94you are prettily shod for walking home,\r\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\r\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\r\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\r\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\r\nleft the room immediately after his brother\xe2\x80\x99s first report of the snow,\r\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\r\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\r\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\r\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep\xe2\x80\x94some way along the Highbury\r\nroad\xe2\x80\x94the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep\xe2\x80\x94in many places hardly\r\nenough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\r\nbut the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\r\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\r\nhim in there being nothing to apprehend.\r\n\r\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\r\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father\xe2\x80\x99s account, who was\r\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\r\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\r\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\r\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\r\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\r\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\r\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father will not be easy; why do not you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready, if the others are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I ring the bell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes\r\nmore, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his\r\nown house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\r\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\r\n\r\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\r\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\r\nWeston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of\r\nalarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\r\ndiscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was\r\nafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\r\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\r\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\r\nas they could;\xe2\x80\x9d and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\r\nslow and wait for the other carriage.\r\n\r\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\r\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\r\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\r\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\r\nand that they were to have a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate drive. It would not have been\r\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\r\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\r\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\r\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\r\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s good wine, and felt sure that he\r\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\r\n\r\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\r\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\r\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\r\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\r\nfound her subject cut up\xe2\x80\x94her hand seized\xe2\x80\x94her attention demanded, and\r\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\r\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\r\nknown, hoping\xe2\x80\x94fearing\xe2\x80\x94adoring\xe2\x80\x94ready to die if she refused him; but\r\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\r\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\r\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\r\nreally was so. Without scruple\xe2\x80\x94without apology\xe2\x80\x94without much apparent\r\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\r\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\r\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\r\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\r\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\r\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\r\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94you take me for my friend\xe2\x80\x94any message to Miss Smith I shall be\r\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Smith!\xe2\x80\x94message to Miss Smith!\xe2\x80\x94What could she possibly mean!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And\r\nhe repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\r\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\r\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\r\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\r\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\r\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\r\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\r\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\r\nfavourable answer.\r\n\r\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\r\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\r\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\r\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\r\nmonth, to Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x94such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\r\nof observing\xe2\x80\x94to be addressing me in this manner\xe2\x80\x94this is an unsteadiness\r\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\r\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\r\nprofessions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Elton, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can be the meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nSmith!\xe2\x80\x94I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\r\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\r\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\r\nsorry\xe2\x80\x94extremely sorry\xe2\x80\x94But, Miss Smith, indeed!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\r\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\r\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\r\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\r\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\r\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\r\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!\xe2\x80\x94(in an accent meant to be\r\ninsinuating)\xe2\x80\x94I am sure you have seen and understood me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this\xe2\x80\x94which of\r\nall her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\r\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\r\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s sanguine state of mind, he\r\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\r\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cit confesses no such thing. So far from having\r\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\r\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\r\nshould have been giving way to any feelings\xe2\x80\x94Nothing could be farther\r\nfrom my wishes\xe2\x80\x94your attachment to my friend Harriet\xe2\x80\x94your pursuit of\r\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\r\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\r\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\r\njudged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\r\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\r\nSmith?\xe2\x80\x94that you have never thought seriously of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, affronted in his turn: \xe2\x80\x9cnever, I assure you.\r\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!\xe2\x80\x94Miss Smith is a very good sort of\r\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\r\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\r\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\r\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!\xe2\x80\x94No, madam, my\r\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\r\nI received\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEncouragement!\xe2\x80\x94I give you encouragement!\xe2\x80\x94Sir, you have been entirely\r\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\r\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\r\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\r\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\r\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\r\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\r\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\r\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\r\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\r\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\r\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\r\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\r\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\r\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\r\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\r\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\r\nsyllable passed.\xe2\x80\x94Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\r\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\r\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to\r\nHartfield.\r\n\r\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had\r\nbeen trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\r\nLane\xe2\x80\x94turning a corner which he could never bear to think of\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nstrange hands\xe2\x80\x94a mere common coachman\xe2\x80\x94no James; and there it seemed as\r\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\r\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\r\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\r\nfather, as to seem\xe2\x80\x94if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\r\ngruel\xe2\x80\x94perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\r\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\r\nexcept herself.\xe2\x80\x94But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\r\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\r\nthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\r\nand be miserable.\xe2\x80\x94It was a wretched business indeed!\xe2\x80\x94Such an overthrow\r\nof every thing she had been wishing for!\xe2\x80\x94Such a development of every\r\nthing most unwelcome!\xe2\x80\x94Such a blow for Harriet!\xe2\x80\x94that was the worst of\r\nall. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\r\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\r\nwould gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken\xe2\x80\x94more in\r\nerror\xe2\x80\x94more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\r\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\r\nany thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me\xe2\x80\x94but poor\r\nHarriet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow she could have been so deceived!\xe2\x80\x94He protested that he had never\r\nthought seriously of Harriet\xe2\x80\x94never! She looked back as well as she\r\ncould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\r\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\r\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\r\nmisled.\r\n\r\nThe picture!\xe2\x80\x94How eager he had been about the picture!\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\ncharade!\xe2\x80\x94and an hundred other circumstances;\xe2\x80\x94how clearly they had\r\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \xe2\x80\x9cready\r\nwit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but then the \xe2\x80\x9csoft eyes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in fact it suited neither; it was a\r\njumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\r\nthick-headed nonsense?\r\n\r\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\r\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\r\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\r\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\r\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\r\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\r\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\r\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\r\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\r\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\r\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\r\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\r\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\r\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\r\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\r\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\r\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\r\n\r\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to pay his\r\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\r\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\r\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\r\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\r\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\r\nbe cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\r\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\r\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\r\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\r\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\r\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\r\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\r\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\r\n\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\r\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x94should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!\xe2\x80\x94look down\r\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\r\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\r\npresumption in addressing her!\xe2\x80\x94It was most provoking.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\r\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\r\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\r\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\r\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\r\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family\xe2\x80\x94and that the\r\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\r\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\r\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\r\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\r\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\r\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\r\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\r\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\r\nhim to notice but his situation and his civility.\xe2\x80\x94But he had fancied\r\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\r\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\r\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\r\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\r\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\r\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\r\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\r\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\r\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\r\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\r\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\r\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\r\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere have I,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cactually talked poor Harriet into being very\r\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\r\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\r\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\r\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\r\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\r\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\r\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\r\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\r\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\r\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\r\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\r\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;\xe2\x80\x94William Coxe\xe2\x80\x94Oh! no, I\r\ncould not endure William Coxe\xe2\x80\x94a pert young lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\r\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\r\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\r\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\r\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\r\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\r\nresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\r\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\r\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\r\ndreadfully.\r\n\r\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma\xe2\x80\x99s, though under temporary\r\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\r\nspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\r\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\r\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\r\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\r\n\r\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\r\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\r\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\r\n\r\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love\r\nwith her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\r\ndisappoint him\xe2\x80\x94that Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s nature should not be of that superior\r\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive\xe2\x80\x94and that there\r\ncould be no necessity for any body\xe2\x80\x99s knowing what had passed except the\r\nthree principals, and especially for her father\xe2\x80\x99s being given a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness about it.\r\n\r\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of\r\nsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome\r\nthat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\r\n\r\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\r\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\r\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\r\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\r\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\r\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\r\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\r\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No\r\nintercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\r\nSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\r\nMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s absenting himself.\r\n\r\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\r\nthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\r\nsociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well\r\nsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\r\nout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\r\nentirely from them,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\r\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\r\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\r\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\r\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\r\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\r\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes\r\nof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still\r\nsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,\r\nas made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\r\nweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\r\nWoodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\r\nbehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set\r\noff, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\r\nIsabella;\xe2\x80\x94which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\r\non, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\r\nbusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\r\nElton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\r\nMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s best compliments, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he was proposing to leave Highbury\r\nthe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the\r\npressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\r\nweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\r\nvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\r\nleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\r\nretain a grateful sense\xe2\x80\x94and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\r\nhappy to attend to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s absence just at this\r\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\r\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\r\nwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\r\nin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\r\nShe had not even a share in his opening compliments.\xe2\x80\x94Her name was not\r\nmentioned;\xe2\x80\x94and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\r\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,\r\nas she thought, at first, could not escape her father\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt did, however.\xe2\x80\x94Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\r\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely\r\nto the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was\r\na very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\r\nand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\r\ntalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\r\nwith all her usual promptitude.\r\n\r\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\r\nto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable\r\nthat she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\r\nher other complaint before the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s return. She went to Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\r\npenance of communication; and a severe one it was.\xe2\x80\x94She had to destroy\r\nall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding\xe2\x80\x94to appear in\r\nthe ungracious character of the one preferred\xe2\x80\x94and acknowledge herself\r\ngrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\r\nher observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\r\nsix weeks.\r\n\r\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame\xe2\x80\x94and the sight of\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\r\nherself again.\r\n\r\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well\xe2\x80\x94blaming nobody\xe2\x80\x94and in every\r\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\r\nof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\r\nher friend.\r\n\r\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\r\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\r\nany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\r\nwould have been too great a distinction.\xe2\x80\x94She never could have deserved\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\r\nhave thought it possible.\r\n\r\nHer tears fell abundantly\xe2\x80\x94but her grief was so truly artless, that no\r\ndignity could have made it more respectable in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nlistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\r\nunderstanding\xe2\x80\x94really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\r\nsuperior creature of the two\xe2\x80\x94and that to resemble her would be more for\r\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\r\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\r\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\r\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father\xe2\x80\x99s claims,\r\nwas to promote Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own\r\naffection in some better method than by match-making. She got her to\r\nHartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to\r\noccupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton\r\nfrom her thoughts.\r\n\r\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she\r\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\r\ngeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.\r\nElton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nage, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might\r\nbe made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s return,\r\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of\r\nacquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\r\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness\xe2\x80\x94and did, in truth, prove\r\nherself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it\r\nappeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\r\ninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend\r\nits continuing very long in equal force.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\r\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\r\nimagine Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\r\nrecollection of him.\r\n\r\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\r\neach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\r\neffecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\r\nother, and make the best of it.\r\n\r\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\r\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\r\nhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\r\nrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\r\nfound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\r\ncure, there could be no true peace for herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,\r\nMrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of\r\nexcuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his \xe2\x80\x9cvery great\r\nmortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of\r\ncoming to Randalls at no distant period.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed\xe2\x80\x94much more disappointed, in\r\nfact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\r\nhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\r\nexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\r\nany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\r\nand begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\r\nsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank\xe2\x80\x99s coming two or three\r\nmonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better\r\nweather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\r\nconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\r\n\r\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a\r\nmore apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\r\nexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\r\nto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\r\n\r\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about\r\nMr. Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s not coming, except as a disappointment at\r\nRandalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,\r\nrather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was\r\ndesirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she\r\ntook care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as\r\nwarmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment, as might naturally\r\nbelong to their friendship.\r\n\r\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\r\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\r\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\r\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\r\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\r\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\r\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\r\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\r\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\r\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\r\nuse of Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s arguments against herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Churchills are very likely in fault,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I dare say he might come if he would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\r\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\r\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\r\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\r\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\r\nlittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\r\nhave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural\r\nthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\r\nproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\r\ntoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\r\ncontrived it between September and January. A man at his age\xe2\x80\x94what is\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x94three or four-and-twenty\xe2\x80\x94cannot be without the means of doing as\r\nmuch as that. It is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\r\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\r\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\r\nto manage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\r\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\r\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\r\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\r\nother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\r\nleave the Churchills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sometimes he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\r\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very unfair to judge of any body\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, without an intimate\r\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\r\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\r\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\r\nChurchill\xe2\x80\x99s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\r\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\r\nat others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\r\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\r\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s duty to pay this attention to his\r\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\r\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\r\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Every sacrifice of mere\r\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\r\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\r\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\r\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94If he would say so to her at\r\nonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\r\nopposition made to his going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps there might be some made to his\r\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\r\nuse!\xe2\x80\x94Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\r\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\r\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\r\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x94Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\r\nloud as he could!\xe2\x80\x94How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\r\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration\xe2\x80\x94made, of\r\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner\xe2\x80\x94would do\r\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\r\npeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\r\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\r\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\r\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\r\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\r\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\r\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\r\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\r\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\r\nlittle minds would bend to his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\r\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\r\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\r\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\r\nto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\r\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\r\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\r\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\r\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\r\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\r\nregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\r\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\r\ncircumstances, to act up to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\r\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\r\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\r\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\r\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\r\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\r\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\r\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\r\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\r\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\r\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\r\nwould have been no difficulty now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never agree about him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is nothing\r\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\r\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\r\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\r\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\r\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\r\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\r\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\r\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\r\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\r\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father\xe2\x80\x99s having any right\r\nto complain. His letters disgust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\r\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace, but without a mother\xe2\x80\x99s affection to blind her. It is on her\r\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\r\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\r\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\r\ndid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\r\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\r\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\r\nFrench, not in English. He may be very \xe2\x80\x98amiable,\xe2\x80\x99 have very good\r\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy\r\ntowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem determined to think ill of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x94not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\r\nmerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\r\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\r\nplausible manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\r\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\r\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\r\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\r\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\r\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest\xe2\x80\x94one object of\r\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\r\nof nobody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\r\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\r\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\r\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\r\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\r\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all\r\nsubjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\r\njust as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\r\nthat is my idea of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that if he turn out any\r\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\r\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company\xe2\x80\x94the great man\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npractised politician, who is to read every body\xe2\x80\x99s character, and make\r\nevery body\xe2\x80\x99s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\r\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\r\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\r\nnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say no more about him,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cyou turn every thing to\r\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\r\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrejudiced! I am not prejudiced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love\r\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a person I never think of from one month\xe2\x80\x99s end to another,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\r\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should\r\nbe angry.\r\n\r\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\r\ndifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\r\nmind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\r\nhigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she\r\nhad never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the\r\nmerit of another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\r\nnot think that Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s solace or her own sins required more; and she\r\nwas therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\r\nreturned;\xe2\x80\x94but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\r\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,\r\nand receiving no other answer than a very plaintive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton is so\r\ngood to the poor!\xe2\x80\x9d she found something else must be done.\r\n\r\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\r\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\r\nalways sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\r\nloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\r\nwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\r\nthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\r\ntheir scanty comforts.\r\n\r\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\r\nas to her deficiency\xe2\x80\x94but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\r\nof its being very disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x94a waste of time\xe2\x80\x94tiresome women\xe2\x80\x94and all\r\nthe horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\r\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and\r\ntherefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden\r\nresolution of not passing their door without going in\xe2\x80\x94observing, as she\r\nproposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were\r\njust now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\r\n\r\nThe house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\r\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized\r\napartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most\r\ncordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who\r\nwith her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to\r\ngive up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking\r\ndaughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks\r\nfor their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\r\nMr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s health, cheerful communications about her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nsweet-cake from the beaufet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cole had just been there, just called\r\nin for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them,\r\nand _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she\r\nliked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss\r\nSmith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\r\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\r\nsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\r\nletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\r\nhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he\r\nwent, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies\xe2\x80\x99 ball had been; and she\r\nwent through it very well, with all the interest and all the\r\ncommendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to\r\nprevent Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s being obliged to say a word.\r\n\r\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\r\nhaving once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\r\nany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the\r\nMistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not\r\nbeen prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was\r\nactually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last\r\nabruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton, I understand\xe2\x80\x94certainly as to dancing\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Cole was\r\ntelling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Cole was so kind\r\nas to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came\r\nin, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite\r\nthere. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her\r\nkindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any\r\nbody can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nknow you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\r\nfor writing;\xe2\x80\x99 and when I immediately said, \xe2\x80\x98But indeed we have, we had\r\na letter this very morning,\xe2\x80\x99 I do not know that I ever saw any body\r\nmore surprized. \xe2\x80\x98Have you, upon your honour?\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98well, that is\r\nquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\r\nhope she is well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. You are so kind!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the happily deceived aunt, while\r\neagerly hunting for the letter.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! here it is. I was sure it could\r\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without\r\nbeing aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very\r\nlately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it\r\nto Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my\r\nmother, for it is such a pleasure to her\xe2\x80\x94a letter from Jane\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\ncan never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and\r\nhere it is, only just under my huswife\xe2\x80\x94and since you are so kind as to\r\nwish to hear what she says;\xe2\x80\x94but, first of all, I really must, in\r\njustice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter\xe2\x80\x94only two\r\npages you see\xe2\x80\x94hardly two\xe2\x80\x94and in general she fills the whole paper and\r\ncrosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\r\nShe often says, when the letter is first opened, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Hetty, now I\r\nthink you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x94And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make\r\nit out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her\xe2\x80\x94every word of it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,\r\nindeed, though my mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are not so good as they were, she can\r\nsee amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is\r\nsuch a blessing! My mother\xe2\x80\x99s are really very good indeed. Jane often\r\nsays, when she is here, \xe2\x80\x98I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very\r\nstrong eyes to see as you do\xe2\x80\x94and so much fine work as you have done\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x94I only wish my eyes may last me as well.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\r\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\r\nFairfax\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are extremely kind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwho are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure\r\nthere is nobody\xe2\x80\x99s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing her, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging\r\nto say about Jane\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\r\ntwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\r\npondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\r\nrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and had almost\r\nresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\r\nBates turned to her again and seized her attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s deafness is very trifling you see\xe2\x80\x94just nothing at all. By\r\nonly raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\r\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\r\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\r\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at\r\nall deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s time of life\xe2\x80\x94and it really is full two years, you know,\r\nsince she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,\r\nand as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough\r\nof her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x94that must be a very great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\r\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\r\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\r\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\r\nCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So\r\nvery good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you\r\nknow. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.\r\nThat is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in\r\nthe common course, we should not have heard from her before next\r\nTuesday or Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\r\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\r\nfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\r\nmother is so delighted!\xe2\x80\x94for she is to be three months with us at least.\r\nThree months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\r\npleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells\r\nare going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to\r\ncome over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till\r\nthe summer, but she is so impatient to see them again\xe2\x80\x94for till she\r\nmarried, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,\r\nwhich must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was\r\ngoing to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very\r\nurgent letter to her mother\xe2\x80\x94or her father, I declare I do not know\r\nwhich it was, but we shall see presently in Jane\xe2\x80\x99s letter\xe2\x80\x94wrote in Mr.\r\nDixon\xe2\x80\x99s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\r\nand they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to\r\ntheir country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has\r\nheard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean\xe2\x80\x94I do not know\r\nthat she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very\r\nnatural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while\r\nhe was paying his addresses\xe2\x80\x94and as Jane used to be very often walking\r\nout with them\xe2\x80\x94for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about\r\ntheir daughter\xe2\x80\x99s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I\r\ndo not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be\r\ntelling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she\r\nwrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views\r\nthat he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I\r\nbelieve. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not\r\ngoing to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\r\ndiscovery,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\r\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\r\nbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\r\nexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\r\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\r\ndistance from us, for months together\xe2\x80\x94not able to come if any thing was\r\nto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\r\nher (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\r\nCampbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\r\nthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\r\nMr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a\r\nmost charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\r\nWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by\r\nthe sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would\r\nhave been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone,\r\nif he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her\r\nhabit\xe2\x80\x94 (I can never think of it without trembling!)\xe2\x80\x94But ever since we\r\nhad the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, in spite of all her friends\xe2\x80\x99 urgency, and her own wish of seeing\r\nIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and\r\nMrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\r\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\r\nair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\r\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no\r\nremarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\r\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no. You are very obliging to say such things\xe2\x80\x94but certainly not.\r\nThere is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was\r\nabsolutely plain\xe2\x80\x94but extremely elegant and amiable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of\r\nNovember, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well\r\nsince. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never\r\nmentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\r\nconsiderate!\xe2\x80\x94But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\r\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\r\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\r\nmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her\xe2\x80\x94and it is certainly a great\r\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\r\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\r\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following\xe2\x80\x94as you will\r\nfind from Jane\xe2\x80\x99s letter. So sudden!\xe2\x80\x94You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\r\nwhat a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\r\nher illness\xe2\x80\x94but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\r\nlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\r\nme, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane\xe2\x80\x99s letters through\r\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\r\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\r\nto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\r\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\r\nburst out, quite frightened, with \xe2\x80\x98Bless me! poor Jane is ill!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\r\nat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\r\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\r\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\r\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\r\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\r\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\r\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife\r\nand family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well,\r\nnow I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will\r\nturn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal\r\nbetter than I can tell it for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we must be running away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\r\nand beginning to rise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy father will be expecting us. I had no\r\nintention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\r\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\r\npass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\r\npleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained\r\nthe street\xe2\x80\x94happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\r\nagainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\r\nJane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s youngest\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94regiment of infantry, and Miss\r\nJane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest;\r\nbut nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him\r\ndying in action abroad\xe2\x80\x94of his widow sinking under consumption and grief\r\nsoon afterwards\xe2\x80\x94and this girl.\r\n\r\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\r\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the\r\nconsolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\r\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her\r\nbeing taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up\r\nwith no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\r\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\r\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\r\n\r\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\r\nto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\r\nFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\r\nfarther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\r\ncamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\r\nhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\r\ndeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing\r\nin his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took\r\nnotice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a\r\ngirl, about Jane\xe2\x80\x99s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long\r\nvisits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years\r\nold, his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a\r\nreal friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of\r\nundertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and\r\nfrom that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s family, and\r\nhad lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\r\nvery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\r\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of\r\nColonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s power; for though his income, by pay and\r\nappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\r\nsupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\r\n\r\nSuch was Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s history. She had fallen into good hands, known\r\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\r\neducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed\r\npeople, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of\r\ndiscipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s residence being in\r\nLondon, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the\r\nattendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were\r\nequally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or\r\nnineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\r\ncare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\r\nbut she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor\r\nmother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil\r\nday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\r\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\r\nrational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of\r\nhome and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\r\nsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this\r\nmight soon be over.\r\n\r\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell\r\nin particular, was the more honourable to each party from the\r\ncircumstance of Jane\xe2\x80\x99s decided superiority both in beauty and\r\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\r\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by\r\nthe parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till\r\nthe marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so\r\noften defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to\r\nwhat is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\r\naffections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\r\nsoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\r\nwhile Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\r\n\r\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\r\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\r\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\r\nfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\r\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\r\nhad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\r\nfrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,\r\npeace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\r\n\r\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\r\nresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\r\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\r\nfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\r\nwould be selfishness:\xe2\x80\x94what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps\r\nthey began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted\r\nthe temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such\r\nenjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,\r\nhowever, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not\r\nhurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since\r\nthe time of their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marriage; and till she should have\r\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\r\nin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\r\nand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\r\nto require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\r\ndischarged with tolerable comfort.\r\n\r\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\r\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not\r\ntold. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\r\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\r\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\r\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\r\nor treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\r\nthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\r\nrecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she\r\nwas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\r\nnovelty which had been so long promised it\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x94must put\r\nup for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\r\nfreshness of a two years\xe2\x80\x99 absence.\r\n\r\nEmma was sorry;\xe2\x80\x94to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\r\nthrough three long months!\xe2\x80\x94to be always doing more than she wished, and\r\nless than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\r\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\r\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\r\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\r\neagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\r\nwhich her conscience could not quite acquit her. But \xe2\x80\x9cshe could never\r\nget acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\r\nsuch coldness and reserve\xe2\x80\x94such apparent indifference whether she\r\npleased or not\xe2\x80\x94and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nwas made such a fuss with by every body!\xe2\x80\x94and it had been always\r\nimagined that they were to be so intimate\xe2\x80\x94because their ages were the\r\nsame, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThese were her reasons\xe2\x80\x94she had no better.\r\n\r\nIt was a dislike so little just\xe2\x80\x94every imputed fault was so magnified by\r\nfancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\r\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\r\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\r\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\r\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\r\nthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as\r\nalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\r\nher figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\r\nbetween fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\r\nto point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\r\nthis; and then, her face\xe2\x80\x94her features\xe2\x80\x94there was more beauty in them\r\naltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\r\npleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\r\neyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\r\nhad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\r\ndelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,\r\nof which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in\r\nhonour, by all her principles, admire it:\xe2\x80\x94elegance, which, whether of\r\nperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be\r\nvulgar, was distinction, and merit.\r\n\r\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\r\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\r\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\r\nshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\r\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she\r\nwas going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\r\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\r\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\r\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so\r\nnaturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\r\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\r\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nactions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her\r\nimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be\r\nsimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been\r\nunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\r\nconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\r\nmight now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\r\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\r\nbeginning her career of laborious duty.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\r\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\r\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that\r\nshe could wish to scheme about for her.\r\n\r\nThese were charming feelings\xe2\x80\x94but not lasting. Before she had committed\r\nherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane\r\nFairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\r\nerrors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cShe certainly is handsome; she\r\nis better than handsome!\xe2\x80\x9d Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\r\nher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\r\nusual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome\r\nas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\r\nadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\r\nexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\r\nsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\r\nnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\r\nthanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\r\naffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\r\nin higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,\r\nwhich was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\r\nat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\r\ndetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved\r\non the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed\r\nbent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s character, or her own\r\nvalue for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It\r\nwas all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or\r\ndistinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown\r\naway. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There\r\nprobably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr.\r\nDixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other,\r\nor been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\r\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\r\nlittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\r\nprocure as to what he truly was. \xe2\x80\x9cWas he handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShe believed he\r\nwas reckoned a very fine young man.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWas he agreeable?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe was\r\ngenerally thought so.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDid he appear a sensible young man; a young man\r\nof information?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAt a watering-place, or in a common London\r\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\r\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\r\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\r\nmanners pleasing.\xe2\x80\x9d Emma could not forgive her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma could not forgive her;\xe2\x80\x94but as neither provocation nor resentment\r\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\r\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\r\nexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\r\nMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\r\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain\r\nenough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her\r\nunjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very pleasant evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\r\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\r\nswept away;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cparticularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\r\nvery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than\r\nsitting at one\xe2\x80\x99s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such\r\nyoung women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am\r\nsure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left\r\nnothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no\r\ninstrument at her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s, it must have been a real indulgence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy you approved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope I am not\r\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father instantly; \xe2\x80\x9c_that_ I am sure you are\r\nnot. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any\r\nthing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night\xe2\x80\x94if it had been\r\nhanded round once, I think it would have been enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not often\r\ndeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\r\nthink you understand me, therefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn arch look expressed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you well enough;\xe2\x80\x9d but she said\r\nonly, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fairfax is reserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always told you she was\xe2\x80\x94a little; but you will soon overcome all\r\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\r\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be\r\nhonoured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think her diffident. I do not see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\r\nand amused to think how little information I obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d was his only answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope every body had a pleasant evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\r\nquiet way. \xe2\x80\x9cI had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\r\nmoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\r\nMiss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\r\nshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\r\nBates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\r\nFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very\r\nwell-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\r\nagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\r\npresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nfrom. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\r\nexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\r\nthoughts were on the Bates\xe2\x80\x99s, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\r\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished\xe2\x80\x94but it is so little one can\r\nventure to do\xe2\x80\x94small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon\xe2\x80\x94Now we\r\nhave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\r\nit is very small and delicate\xe2\x80\x94Hartfield pork is not like any other\r\npork\xe2\x80\x94but still it is pork\xe2\x80\x94and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\r\nof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,\r\nwithout the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear\r\nroast pork\xe2\x80\x94I think we had better send the leg\xe2\x80\x94do not you think so, my\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\r\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\r\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\r\nthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\r\nis not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\r\nboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\r\nlittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a piece of news for you.\r\nYou like news\xe2\x80\x94and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\r\ninterest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?\xe2\x80\x94why do you smile\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x94where did you hear it?\xe2\x80\x94at Randalls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had time only to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\xe2\x80\x9d when the door was\r\nthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\r\nof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give\r\nquickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that\r\nnot another syllable of communication could rest with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are\r\ntoo bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\r\nmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\r\ncompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\r\nlittle blush, at the sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is my news:\xe2\x80\x94I thought it would interest you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\r\nhad passed between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where could _you_ hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Bates. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere could you\r\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\r\nreceived Mrs. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s note\xe2\x80\x94no, it cannot be more than five\xe2\x80\x94or at least\r\nten\xe2\x80\x94for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork\xe2\x80\x94Jane was\r\nstanding in the passage\xe2\x80\x94were not you, Jane?\xe2\x80\x94for my mother was so afraid\r\nthat we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down\r\nand see, and Jane said, \xe2\x80\x98Shall I go down instead? for I think you have\r\na little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh! my dear,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I\xe2\x80\x94well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\r\nknow. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you\r\npossibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of\r\nit, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\r\nread Elton\xe2\x80\x99s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that is quite\xe2\x80\x94I suppose there never was a piece of news more\r\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\r\nmother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\r\nthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe consider our Hartfield pork,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cindeed it\r\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\r\ncannot have a greater pleasure than\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to\r\nus. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\r\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We\r\nmay well say that \xe2\x80\x98our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, Mr.\r\nKnightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was short\xe2\x80\x94merely to announce\xe2\x80\x94but cheerful, exulting, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHere was a sly glance at Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had been so fortunate as to\xe2\x80\x94I forget\r\nthe precise words\xe2\x80\x94one has no business to remember them. The information\r\nwas, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins.\r\nBy his style, I should imagine it just settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton going to be married!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will have every body\xe2\x80\x99s wishes for his happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very young to settle,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s observation. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had\r\nbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\r\nwere always glad to see him at Hartfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Bates,\r\njoyfully; \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother is so pleased!\xe2\x80\x94she says she cannot bear to have\r\nthe poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.\r\nJane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!\xe2\x80\x94no wonder that you have such a\r\ncuriosity to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\r\noccupy her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I have never seen Mr. Elton,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, starting on this appeal;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis he\xe2\x80\x94is he a tall man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho shall answer that question?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father would say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Knightley \xe2\x80\x98no;\xe2\x80\x99 and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\r\nhappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\r\nyou will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\r\nHighbury, both in person and mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was\r\nprecisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,\xe2\x80\x94I dare say, an\r\nexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother\xe2\x80\x94wanting her\r\nto sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\r\nmother is a little deaf, you know\xe2\x80\x94it is not much, but she does not hear\r\nquite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\r\nfancied bathing might be good for it\xe2\x80\x94the warm bath\xe2\x80\x94but she says it did\r\nhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\r\nAnd Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\r\nis such a happiness when good people get together\xe2\x80\x94and they always do.\r\nNow, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\r\nsuch very good people; and the Perrys\xe2\x80\x94I suppose there never was a\r\nhappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nturning to Mr. Woodhouse, \xe2\x80\x9cI think there are few places with such\r\nsociety as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our\r\nneighbours.\xe2\x80\x94My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better\r\nthan another, it is pork\xe2\x80\x94a roast loin of pork\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\r\nwith her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing I suppose can be known. One feels that\r\nit cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four\r\nweeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\r\nEmma said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are silent, Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x94but I hope you mean to take an interest\r\nin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on\r\nthese subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\r\nCampbell\xe2\x80\x99s account\xe2\x80\x94we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\r\nElton and Miss Hawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have seen Mr. Elton,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I shall be\r\ninterested\xe2\x80\x94but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\r\nmonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss\r\nWoodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Bates, \xe2\x80\x9cfour weeks yesterday.\xe2\x80\x94A Miss\r\nHawkins!\xe2\x80\x94Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady\r\nhereabouts; not that I ever\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Cole once whispered to me\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nimmediately said, \xe2\x80\x98No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94In\r\nshort, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of\r\ndiscoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the\r\nsame time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nWoodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\r\noffend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered\r\nnow. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear\r\nlittle children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr.\r\nJohn Knightley. I mean in person\xe2\x80\x94tall, and with that sort of look\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot very talkative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\r\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\r\nnot, strictly speaking, handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome! Oh! no\xe2\x80\x94far from it\xe2\x80\x94certainly plain. I told you he was\r\nplain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\r\nand that you yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I\r\nalways think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\r\ngeneral opinion, when I called him plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather\r\ndoes not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging,\r\nmy dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a\r\nmost agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs.\r\nCole\xe2\x80\x99s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better\r\ngo home directly\xe2\x80\x94I would not have you out in a shower!\xe2\x80\x94We think she is\r\nthe better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\r\nattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares\r\nfor any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be\r\nanother thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is\r\ncoming too. Well, that is so very!\xe2\x80\x94I am sure if Jane is tired, you will\r\nbe so kind as to give her your arm.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!\xe2\x80\x94Good\r\nmorning to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\r\nhe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry\xe2\x80\x94and to\r\nmarry strangers too\xe2\x80\x94and the other half she could give to her own view\r\nof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\r\nof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but\r\nshe was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it\xe2\x80\x94and all that she could\r\nhope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from\r\nhearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was\r\nlikely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!\xe2\x80\x94and upon its\r\nbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\r\ndetaining her at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, and that the intelligence would\r\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\r\n\r\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\r\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\r\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\nMiss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\xe2\x80\x9d which instantly burst\r\nforth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow\r\nwas given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than\r\nin listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had\r\nto tell. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had set out from Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s half an hour ago\xe2\x80\x94she had\r\nbeen afraid it would rain\xe2\x80\x94she had been afraid it would pour down every\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94but she thought she might get to Hartfield first\xe2\x80\x94she had hurried\r\non as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where\r\na young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just\r\nstep in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\r\nhalf a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she\r\ndid not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could,\r\nand took shelter at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Ford\xe2\x80\x99s was the principal woollen-draper,\r\nlinen-draper, and haberdasher\xe2\x80\x99s shop united; the shop first in size and\r\nfashion in the place.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, there she had set, without an idea of\r\nany thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94when, all of a\r\nsudden, who should come in\xe2\x80\x94to be sure it was so very odd!\xe2\x80\x94but they\r\nalways dealt at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her\r\nbrother!\xe2\x80\x94Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have\r\nfainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the\r\numbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\r\nno notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and\r\nI kept sitting near the door!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I\r\nmust have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,\r\nbecause of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94well, at last, I fancy, he looked round\r\nand saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began\r\nwhispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I\r\ncould not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me\xe2\x80\x94(do\r\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)\xe2\x80\x94for presently she came forward\xe2\x80\x94came\r\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake\r\nhands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she\r\nused; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to\r\nbe very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but\r\nI know no more what I said\xe2\x80\x94I was in such a tremble!\xe2\x80\x94I remember she said\r\nshe was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear,\r\nMiss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was\r\nbeginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me\r\nfrom getting away\xe2\x80\x94and then\xe2\x80\x94only think!\xe2\x80\x94I found he was coming up towards\r\nme too\xe2\x80\x94slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\r\nso he came and spoke, and I answered\xe2\x80\x94and I stood for a minute, feeling\r\ndreadfully, you know, one can\xe2\x80\x99t tell how; and then I took courage, and\r\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not\r\ngot three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I\r\nwas going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.\r\nCole\xe2\x80\x99s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this\r\nrain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I\r\nsaid, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and\r\nthen he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve I did\xe2\x80\x94but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh!\r\nMiss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and\r\nyet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so\r\npleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do\r\ntalk to me and make me comfortable again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\r\nher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\r\ncomfortable herself. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and his sister\xe2\x80\x99s, seemed\r\nthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\r\ndescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded\r\naffection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed\r\nthem to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did\r\nthis make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed\r\nby it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her\xe2\x80\x94they must be all sorry.\r\nAmbition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all\r\nhave hoped to rise by Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance: and besides, what was the\r\nvalue of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s description?\xe2\x80\x94So easily pleased\xe2\x80\x94so little\r\ndiscerning;\xe2\x80\x94what signified her praise?\r\n\r\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by\r\nconsidering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of\r\nbeing dwelt on,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be distressing, for the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you seem to\r\nhave behaved extremely well; and it is over\xe2\x80\x94and may never\xe2\x80\x94can never, as\r\na first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet said, \xe2\x80\x9cvery true,\xe2\x80\x9d and she \xe2\x80\x9cwould not think about it;\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nstill she talked of it\xe2\x80\x94still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma,\r\nat last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to\r\nhurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender\r\ncaution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed\r\nor only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet\xe2\x80\x94such a\r\nconclusion of Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s importance with her!\r\n\r\nMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\r\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an\r\nhour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first\r\nconversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations\r\nof curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this\r\nfortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under\r\nproper subordination in her fancy.\r\n\r\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\r\nhad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining\r\nany influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\r\nat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\r\ncourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\r\nbrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s; and a\r\ntwelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with\r\nany necessity, or even any power of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\r\nsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\r\nbeing kindly spoken of.\r\n\r\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s name was first mentioned in\r\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\r\nevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant,\r\nhighly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself\r\narrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of\r\nher merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her\r\nChristian name, and say whose music she principally played.\r\n\r\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\r\nmortified\xe2\x80\x94disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\r\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\r\nlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\r\nhad gone away deeply offended\xe2\x80\x94he came back engaged to another\xe2\x80\x94and to\r\nanother as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\r\ncircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back\r\ngay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss\r\nWoodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\r\nof perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent\r\nfortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of\r\nsome dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had\r\nnot thrown himself away\xe2\x80\x94he had gained a woman of 10,000 _l_. or\r\nthereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfirst hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\r\ndistinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of\r\nthe rise and progress of the affair was so glorious\xe2\x80\x94the steps so quick,\r\nfrom the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\nparty at Mrs. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94smiles and blushes rising in importance\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nconsciousness and agitation richly scattered\xe2\x80\x94the lady had been so\r\neasily impressed\xe2\x80\x94so sweetly disposed\xe2\x80\x94had in short, to use a most\r\nintelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, that vanity and\r\nprudence were equally contented.\r\n\r\nHe had caught both substance and shadow\xe2\x80\x94both fortune and affection, and\r\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his\r\nown concerns\xe2\x80\x94expecting to be congratulated\xe2\x80\x94ready to be laughed at\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nwith cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of\r\nthe place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously\r\ngallant.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\r\nplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\r\nwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\r\na certain glance of Mrs. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s did not seem to contradict, that when\r\nhe next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\r\n\r\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\r\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the\r\nimpression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and\r\npretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very\r\nmuch to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his\r\nsight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable\r\nfeelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a\r\nsource of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been\r\nthankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very\r\nwell; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would\r\nadminister most satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\r\ncertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\r\nprevented\xe2\x80\x94many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be\r\nan excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\r\nwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good\r\nenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for\r\nHighbury\xe2\x80\x94handsome enough\xe2\x80\x94to look plain, probably, by Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s side. As\r\nto connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all\r\nhis own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On\r\nthat article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be\r\nuncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the\r\n10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s superior.\r\nShe brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the\r\nyoungest of the two daughters of a Bristol\xe2\x80\x94merchant, of course, he must\r\nbe called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life\r\nappeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of\r\nhis line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she\r\nhad been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very\r\nheart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years\r\nago, an uncle remained\xe2\x80\x94in the law line\xe2\x80\x94nothing more distinctly\r\nhonourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and\r\nwith him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of\r\nsome attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the\r\nconnexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_\r\n_married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept\r\ntwo carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory\r\nof Miss Hawkins.\r\n\r\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\r\ntalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\r\nof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\r\ncertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\r\nwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\r\nher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\r\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\r\nreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\r\nsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times\r\nevery day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss\r\nhim, _just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have\r\nsomething occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring\r\nwarmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually\r\nhearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always\r\namong those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so\r\ninteresting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,\r\ntherefore, every guess\xe2\x80\x94all that had already occurred, all that might\r\noccur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,\r\nservants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her\r\nregard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her\r\nregrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of\r\nMiss Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he\r\nseemed attached!\xe2\x80\x94his air as he walked by the house\xe2\x80\x94the very sitting of\r\nhis hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\r\n\r\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\r\nfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nEmma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\r\npredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\r\nas a check to the other. Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s engagement had been the cure of\r\nthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\r\nknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s calling at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s a few days afterwards. Harriet had\r\nnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,\r\nwritten in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a\r\ngreat deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had\r\nbeen much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done\r\nin return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.\r\nElton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the\r\nMartins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for\r\nBath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\r\njudged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin\xe2\x80\x99s visit.\r\n\r\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged\xe2\x80\x94what would be necessary\xe2\x80\x94and what\r\nmight be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\r\nAbsolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\r\nbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\r\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\r\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\r\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\r\nAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so\r\nsoon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\r\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\r\nof intimacy was chosen for the future.\r\n\r\nShe could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\r\nwhich her own heart could not approve\xe2\x80\x94something of ingratitude, merely\r\nglossed over\xe2\x80\x94it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\r\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, her evil stars had led her to\r\nthe very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\r\nPhilip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\r\nbeing lifted into the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s cart, which was to convey it to where\r\nthe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\r\nand the direction, was consequently a blank.\r\n\r\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\r\nput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\r\nespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\r\nhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\r\nrevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed\r\nher to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which\r\ndetermined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of\r\nan hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old\r\nservant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\r\n\r\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\r\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\r\nunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\r\ngravel walk\xe2\x80\x94a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\r\nher seemingly with ceremonious civility.\r\n\r\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\r\nfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\r\nunderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\r\nShe had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\r\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace\r\nhad been talked almost all the time\xe2\x80\x94till just at last, when Mrs.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was\r\ngrown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.\r\nIn that very room she had been measured last September, with her two\r\nfriends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot\r\nby the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day,\r\nthe hour, the party, the occasion\xe2\x80\x94to feel the same consciousness, the\r\nsame regrets\xe2\x80\x94to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and\r\nthey were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must\r\nsuspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when\r\nthe carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and\r\nthe shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to\r\nbe given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six\r\nmonths ago!\xe2\x80\x94Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they\r\nmight resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business.\r\nShe would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\r\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\r\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\r\nhave done otherwise?\xe2\x80\x94Impossible!\xe2\x80\x94She could not repent. They must be\r\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process\xe2\x80\x94so much to\r\nherself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\r\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure\r\nit. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\r\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that\r\nneither \xe2\x80\x9cmaster nor mistress was at home;\xe2\x80\x9d they had both been out some\r\ntime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, as they turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now we shall\r\njust miss them; too provoking!\xe2\x80\x94I do not know when I have been so\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\r\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both\xe2\x80\x94such being\r\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the\r\ncarriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who\r\nwere standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight\r\nof them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound\xe2\x80\x94for Mr.\r\nWeston immediately accosted her with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do?\xe2\x80\x94how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do?\xe2\x80\x94We have been sitting with your father\xe2\x80\x94glad\r\nto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94I had a letter this\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty\xe2\x80\x94he is at\r\nOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\r\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\r\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\r\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\r\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\r\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s, confirmed as it all was\r\nby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but\r\nnot less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain\r\nwas enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice\r\nin their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted\r\nspirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was\r\ncoming; and in the rapidity of half a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, she hoped Mr.\r\nElton would now be talked of no more.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\r\nallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his\r\ncommand, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she\r\nlistened, and smiled, and congratulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, at the conclusion.\r\n\r\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better move on, Mr. Weston,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are detaining the\r\ngirls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I am ready;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and turning again to Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you must not\r\nbe expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\r\naccount you know; I dare say he is really nothing\r\nextraordinary:\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\r\nspeaking a very different conviction.\r\n\r\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\r\nmanner that appropriated nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mrs.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x94depend upon it he will be here by three,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a\r\ndifferent air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\r\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\r\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\r\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was a\r\nquestion, however, which did not augur much.\r\n\r\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\r\nwas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s faithful\r\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, that\r\nshe was to think of her at four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, dear anxious friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said she, in mental soliloquy, while\r\nwalking downstairs from her own room, \xe2\x80\x9calways overcareful for every\r\nbody\xe2\x80\x99s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\r\ngoing again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nclock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis twelve; I\r\nshall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time\r\nto-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\r\npossibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\r\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of\r\nFrank\xe2\x80\x99s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the\r\nmidst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,\r\nto have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was\r\nactually before her\xe2\x80\x94he was presented to her, and she did not think too\r\nmuch had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young\r\nman; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his\r\ncountenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that she\r\nshould like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a\r\nreadiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be\r\nacquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\r\n\r\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\r\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\r\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you\r\nall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\r\nused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\r\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\r\nupon one\xe2\x80\x99s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\r\nmore than any little exertion it needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cthough there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\r\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\r\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\r\nconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\r\nwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\r\nallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\r\nHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\r\nto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\r\nhe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\r\npassed suspiciously through Emma\xe2\x80\x99s brain; but still, if it were a\r\nfalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner\r\nhad no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if\r\nin a state of no common enjoyment.\r\n\r\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\r\nacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWas she a\r\nhorsewoman?\xe2\x80\x94Pleasant rides?\xe2\x80\x94Pleasant walks?\xe2\x80\x94Had they a large\r\nneighbourhood?\xe2\x80\x94Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?\xe2\x80\x94There were\r\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.\xe2\x80\x94Balls\xe2\x80\x94had they balls?\xe2\x80\x94Was\r\nit a musical society?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\r\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\r\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\r\nmother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so\r\nmuch warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured\r\nto his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an\r\nadditional proof of his knowing how to please\xe2\x80\x94and of his certainly\r\nthinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word\r\nof praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.\r\nWeston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He\r\nunderstood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chad been the wisest measure, every friend\r\nmust rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a\r\nblessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest\r\nobligation on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s merits,\r\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\r\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s. And at last, as if\r\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\r\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\r\nher person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\r\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\r\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cwere you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\r\nwith pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\r\nsuch words. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a\r\npretty young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I should know better,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cno, depend upon it, (with a\r\ngallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I\r\nmight praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\r\nterms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\r\ntheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her\r\nmind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be\r\nconsidered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must\r\nsee more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they\r\nwere agreeable.\r\n\r\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\r\neye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\r\nexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she\r\nwas confident that he was often listening.\r\n\r\nHer own father\xe2\x80\x99s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\r\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\r\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\r\napproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.\xe2\x80\x94Though always objecting to\r\nevery marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the\r\napprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any\r\ntwo persons\xe2\x80\x99 understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\r\nwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\r\nnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\r\nglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\r\nhis natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\r\nFrank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\r\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\r\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold\xe2\x80\x94which,\r\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\r\nafter another night.\r\n\r\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be going.\r\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\r\nfor Mrs. Weston at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, but he need not hurry any body else.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nson, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\r\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\r\nmay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a\r\nneighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\r\nHighbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\r\nI suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the\r\nproper name\xe2\x80\x94I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\r\nfamily of that name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure we do,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his father; \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x94we passed her house\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsaw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss\r\nFairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.\r\nCall upon her, by all means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity for my calling this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nman; \xe2\x80\x9canother day would do as well; but there was that degree of\r\nacquaintance at Weymouth which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\r\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\r\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You\r\nsaw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she\r\nmixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely\r\nenough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son looked convinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is a very\r\nelegant young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d as inclined her almost to\r\ndoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\r\nof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\r\nonly ordinarily gifted with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her\r\nand hear her\xe2\x80\x94no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has\r\nan aunt who never holds her tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; \xe2\x80\x9cthen give\r\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\r\nlady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\r\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\r\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\r\nshew you the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\r\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\r\nhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\r\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\r\nhad best cross the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\r\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend,\r\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\r\nit, and as to Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\r\nstep, and jump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\r\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma\r\nremained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and\r\ncould now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,\r\nwith full confidence in their comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\r\nWeston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He\r\nhad been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\r\ntill her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their\r\nwalk, immediately fixed on Highbury.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not doubt there being very\r\npleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\r\nchuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\r\nwould be his constant attraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\r\nfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction\r\nwith him. They walked thither directly.\r\n\r\nEmma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\r\nhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\r\nnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\r\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\r\narm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\r\ncompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\r\nwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\r\nfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\r\nwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid\r\nhis duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole\r\nmanner to her\xe2\x80\x94nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of\r\nconsidering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there was\r\ntime enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit\r\nincluded all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about\r\ntogether for an hour or two\xe2\x80\x94first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,\r\nand afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired\r\nHartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s ear; and when their going\r\nfarther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with\r\nthe whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much\r\noftener than Emma could have supposed.\r\n\r\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\r\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\r\nwhich had been the home of his father\xe2\x80\x99s father; and on recollecting\r\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\r\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\r\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\r\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\r\nbe very like a merit to those he was with.\r\n\r\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\r\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\r\nabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a\r\nparade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had\r\nnot done him justice.\r\n\r\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\r\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\r\nwere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\r\nrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\r\nany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\r\nthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a\r\nball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\r\npopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;\xe2\x80\x94but such\r\nbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\r\nwhich it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\r\namong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\r\ninterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\r\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\r\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\r\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no\r\nfault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No,\r\nit was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\r\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\r\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the\r\nformer good old days of the room?\xe2\x80\x94She who could do any thing in\r\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\r\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\r\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\r\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\r\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when\r\nparticulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling\r\nto admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing,\r\nor that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a\r\nyoung man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to\r\nsee the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the\r\nhabits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,\r\ncheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing\r\nof the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was,\r\nperhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank,\r\nbordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however,\r\nof the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and\r\nbeing now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\r\nrecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\r\npaid it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, oh! yes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to mention it. A very\r\nsuccessful visit:\xe2\x80\x94I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\r\nobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\r\nme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\r\nwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\r\nwould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;\r\nand I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthere was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I\r\nfound, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that\r\nI had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an\r\nhour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll, very ill\xe2\x80\x94that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\r\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\r\nLadies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\r\npale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.\xe2\x80\x94A most\r\ndeplorable want of complexion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\r\nFairfax\xe2\x80\x99s complexion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was certainly never brilliant, but she would\r\nnot allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness\r\nand delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character\r\nof her face.\xe2\x80\x9d He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he\r\nhad heard many people say the same\xe2\x80\x94but yet he must confess, that to him\r\nnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.\r\nWhere features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them\r\nall; and where they were good, the effect was\xe2\x80\x94fortunately he need not\r\nattempt to describe what the effect was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no disputing about taste.\xe2\x80\x94At least you\r\nadmire her except her complexion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and laughed.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\r\ncomplexion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same\r\nsociety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, and he hastily exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\r\ntheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\r\nsays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s. If\r\nit be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\r\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\r\nbuy something at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s. It will be taking out my freedom.\xe2\x80\x94I dare say\r\nthey sell gloves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\r\nbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\r\nyou were Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94but lay out half a guinea at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, and your\r\npopularity will stand upon your own virtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \xe2\x80\x9cMen\xe2\x80\x99s Beavers\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cYork Tan\xe2\x80\x9d were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\r\nyou were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\r\n_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\r\npublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\r\nprivate life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\r\nparty at Weymouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\r\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady\xe2\x80\x99s right to decide on the degree\r\nof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\r\nher account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\r\nreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\r\nbody, that I really think you may say what you like of your\r\nacquaintance with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I, indeed?\xe2\x80\x94Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\r\nwell. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\r\nlittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\r\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\r\nwarm-hearted woman. I like them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s situation in life, I conclude; what she is\r\ndestined to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94(rather hesitatingly)\xe2\x80\x94I believe I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston smiling;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cremember that I am here.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\r\nwhen you speak of Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s situation in life. I will move a\r\nlittle farther off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly do forget to think of _her_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cas having ever\r\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, \xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank\r\nChurchill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver hear her!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget how much she belongs to\r\nHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\r\nShe plays charmingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so, do you?\xe2\x80\x94I wanted the opinion of some one who could\r\nreally judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\r\nconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of\r\njudging of any body\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\xe2\x80\x94I have been used to hear her\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman\xe2\x80\x94engaged to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94on the point of marriage\xe2\x80\x94would yet never ask that other woman to\r\nsit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\r\ninstead\xe2\x80\x94never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\r\nThat, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProof indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, highly amused.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Dixon is very musical,\r\nis he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\r\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\r\nvery strong proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\r\nthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\r\nto me. I could not excuse a man\xe2\x80\x99s having more music than love\xe2\x80\x94more ear\r\nthan eye\xe2\x80\x94a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\r\nHow did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was her very particular friend, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cOne would rather have a stranger\r\npreferred than one\xe2\x80\x99s very particular friend\xe2\x80\x94with a stranger it might\r\nnot recur again\xe2\x80\x94but the misery of having a very particular friend\r\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!\xe2\x80\x94Poor\r\nMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\r\nreally did not seem to feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better\xe2\x80\x94or so much the worse:\xe2\x80\x94I do not know which. But be\r\nit sweetness or be it stupidity in her\xe2\x80\x94quickness of friendship, or\r\ndulness of feeling\xe2\x80\x94there was one person, I think, who must have felt\r\nit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\r\ndistinction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that\xe2\x80\x94I do not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\r\nbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\r\nwas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nbegan rather quickly, but checking himself, added, \xe2\x80\x9chowever, it is\r\nimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were\xe2\x80\x94how it might\r\nall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\r\noutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a\r\nbetter judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\r\nherself in critical situations, than I can be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and\r\nwomen together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\r\nintimate,\xe2\x80\x94that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\r\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\r\nlittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to\r\ntake disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always\r\nwas, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her\r\nreserve\xe2\x80\x94I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOftentimes very\r\nconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\r\nbut no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\r\nmay be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\r\nagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\r\nconquering any body\xe2\x80\x99s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\r\nFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\r\nill of her\xe2\x80\x94not the least\xe2\x80\x94except that such extreme and perpetual\r\ncautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\r\nabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something\r\nto conceal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\r\nthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\r\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He\r\nwas not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in\r\nsome of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore\r\nbetter than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nfeelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of\r\nconsidering Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s house, which, as well as the church, he would\r\ngo and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,\r\nhe could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to\r\nbe pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,\r\nhe could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There\r\nmust be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a\r\nblockhead who wanted more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking\r\nabout. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking\r\nhow many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he\r\ncould be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small\r\none. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\r\nwas talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to\r\nsettle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not\r\nbe aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no\r\nhousekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, or a bad butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry, but no doubt he did\r\nperfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that\r\nwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to\r\nbe allowed an early establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\r\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to\r\nhave his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at\r\nbreakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\r\nreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\r\nhaving his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling\r\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of\r\nfoppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not\r\naccord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even\r\nthe unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to\r\ndiscern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\r\nrestlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\r\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\r\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\r\nliable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and\r\nthought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was\r\nclear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making\r\nno other comment than that \xe2\x80\x9call young people would have their little\r\nwhims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\r\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was\r\nvery ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\r\nappeared to have a very open temper\xe2\x80\x94certainly a very cheerful and\r\nlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great\r\ndeal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond\r\nof talking of him\xe2\x80\x94said he would be the best man in the world if he were\r\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\r\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\r\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\r\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\r\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\r\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of\r\nbeing at least very near it, and saved only by her own\r\nindifference\xe2\x80\x94(for still her resolution held of never marrying)\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have\r\nsome weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\r\nextremely\xe2\x80\x94thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\r\nmuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\r\nharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, \xe2\x80\x9call young people would have their\r\nlittle whims.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\r\nleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\r\nof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were\r\nmade for the little excesses of such a handsome young man\xe2\x80\x94one who\r\nsmiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them\r\nnot to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nKnightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,\r\nhe was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to\r\nhimself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cHum! just the trifling,\r\nsilly fellow I took him for.\xe2\x80\x9d She had half a mind to resent; but an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s observation convinced her that it was really said only to\r\nrelieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she\r\nlet it pass.\r\n\r\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s visit this morning was in another respect particularly\r\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make\r\nEmma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted\r\nexactly the advice they gave.\r\n\r\nThis was the occurrence:\xe2\x80\x94The Coles had been settled some years in\r\nHighbury, and were very good sort of people\xe2\x80\x94friendly, liberal, and\r\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in\r\ntrade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the\r\ncountry, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping\r\nlittle company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two\r\nhad brought them a considerable increase of means\xe2\x80\x94the house in town had\r\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.\r\nWith their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,\r\ntheir inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their\r\nnumber of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time\r\nwere, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at\r\nHartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared\r\nevery body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly\r\namong the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best\r\nfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite\xe2\x80\x94neither\r\nDonwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,\r\nif they did; and she regretted that her father\xe2\x80\x99s known habits would be\r\ngiving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were\r\nvery respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was\r\nnot for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would\r\nvisit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only\r\nfrom herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\r\n\r\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\r\nbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\r\nvery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\r\ninvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s accounting for it with \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they will not take the\r\nliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\xe2\x80\x9d was not quite\r\nsufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\r\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled\r\nthere, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,\r\noccurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been\r\ntempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the\r\nBateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the\r\nday before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her\r\nabsence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of\r\nhis. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her\r\nspirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the\r\nomission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\r\n\r\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\r\nHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\r\nfirst remark, on reading it, was that \xe2\x80\x9cof course it must be declined,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\r\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\r\n\r\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without\r\ninclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\r\nproperly\xe2\x80\x94there was so much real attention in the manner of it\xe2\x80\x94so much\r\nconsideration for her father. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would have solicited the honour\r\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\r\nLondon, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\r\nair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\r\nof his company.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\r\nbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without\r\nneglecting his comfort\xe2\x80\x94how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,\r\nmight be depended on for bearing him company\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Woodhouse was to be\r\ntalked into an acquiescence of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s going out to dinner on a\r\nday now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As\r\nfor _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours\r\nwould be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not fond of dinner-visiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI never was. No more is\r\nEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\r\nshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\r\nin one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us\xe2\x80\x94take us in\r\ntheir afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\r\nreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\r\nevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\r\nbody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\r\nwith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to\r\ntake care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be\r\nwhat it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to Mrs.\r\nWeston, with a look of gentle reproach\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Miss Taylor, if you had not\r\nmarried, you would have staid at home with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cas I took Miss Taylor away, it is\r\nincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\r\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not\r\nlessening, Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s agitation. The ladies knew better how to\r\nallay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\r\nas usual. \xe2\x80\x9cHe should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great\r\nregard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her.\r\nJames could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer\r\nwritten to Mrs. Cole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will\r\nsay that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\r\ndecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of\r\ncourse. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is\r\nto be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will\r\nbe wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have\r\nnever been there above once since the new approach was made; but still\r\nI have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get\r\nthere, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you\r\nagain; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying\r\nlate. You will get very tired when tea is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great\r\nmany people talking at once. You will not like the noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cif Emma comes away early, it\r\nwill be breaking up the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no great harm if it does,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sooner every\r\nparty breaks up, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\naway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\r\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel\r\nthat any body\xe2\x80\x99s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s doing it would be more thought of than any other person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I\r\nam sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\r\nbeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you\r\nfor reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\r\npain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\r\nnever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\r\nhe is bilious\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of\r\ngiving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\r\nrather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\r\nlittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\r\nwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\r\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\r\nonly afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not\r\nbeing exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\r\nknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\r\nyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time\xe2\x80\x94and the idea of\r\nthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if\r\nshe came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\r\nhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\r\nsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\r\nthing were safe in the house, as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father\xe2\x80\x99s dinner\r\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\r\nfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any\r\nimperfection which could be concealed.\r\n\r\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\r\ngood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\r\ndone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any\r\nconfusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his\r\nspirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after\r\nseeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do\r\ncease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\r\nway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.\xe2\x80\x94It\r\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\r\n_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\r\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been\r\nashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a\r\ncoxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\r\nvanities.\xe2\x80\x94No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a\r\nlonger time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\r\ninference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\r\nhow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\r\nand of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\r\nnow seeing them together for the first time.\r\n\r\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\r\nCole\xe2\x80\x99s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\r\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\r\nhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\r\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\r\nthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\r\ndinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\r\ndress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\r\nthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\r\nunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\r\nthem to practise during the meal.\xe2\x80\x94She had provided a plentiful dinner\r\nfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s door; and was pleased to\r\nsee that it was Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\r\nhaving little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\r\nindependence, was too apt, in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, to get about as he could,\r\nand not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\r\nShe had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\r\nher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is coming as you should do,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9clike a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nquite glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thanked her, observing, \xe2\x80\x9cHow lucky that we should arrive at the same\r\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\r\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.\xe2\x80\x94You\r\nmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\r\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\r\nbeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\r\nwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I\r\nalways observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_\r\nyou have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed\r\nashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_\r\nI shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsensical girl!\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply, but not at all in anger.\r\n\r\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\r\nwith Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\r\nnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When\r\nthe Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\r\nadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\r\nher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\r\nand at dinner she found him seated by her\xe2\x80\x94and, as she firmly believed,\r\nnot without some dexterity on his side.\r\n\r\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\r\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\r\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox\xe2\x80\x99s family,\r\nthe lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\r\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at\r\ndinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\r\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\r\nfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her\r\nneighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to\r\nattend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating\r\nsomething of her that was expected to be very interesting. She\r\nlistened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of\r\nEmma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that\r\nshe had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room\r\nhad been struck by the sight of a pianoforte\xe2\x80\x94a very elegant looking\r\ninstrument\xe2\x80\x94not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\r\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\r\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and\r\nexplanations on Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived\r\nfrom Broadwood\xe2\x80\x99s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt\r\nand niece\xe2\x80\x94entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s account,\r\nJane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\r\npossibly have ordered it\xe2\x80\x94but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\r\nthat it could be from only one quarter;\xe2\x80\x94of course it must be from\r\nColonel Campbell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can suppose nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Cole, \xe2\x80\x9cand I was only\r\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\r\nhad a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\r\nShe knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\r\nany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\r\nto surprize her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\r\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\r\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\r\nenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\r\nlisten to Mrs. Cole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\r\nmore satisfaction!\xe2\x80\x94It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\r\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a\r\nshame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\r\ninstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a\r\nslap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I\r\nreally was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\r\ndrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\r\ngirls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\r\nit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\r\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\r\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.\xe2\x80\x94I was saying this to Mr.\r\nCole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\r\nparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in\r\nthe purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\r\nobliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\r\nreally is the reason why the instrument was bought\xe2\x80\x94or else I am sure we\r\nought to be ashamed of it.\xe2\x80\x94We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\r\nmay be prevailed with to try it this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\r\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s, turned\r\nto Frank Churchill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you smile?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, why do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x94I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s being so rich\r\nand so liberal.\xe2\x80\x94It is a handsome present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather wonder that it was never made before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr that he did not give her the use of their own instrument\xe2\x80\x94which must\r\nnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\r\nBates\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may _say_ what you chuse\xe2\x80\x94but your countenance testifies that your\r\n_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\r\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\r\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\r\nthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She\r\nmust know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;\r\nand perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a\r\nyoung woman\xe2\x80\x99s scheme than an elderly man\xe2\x80\x99s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare\r\nsay. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Dixon.\xe2\x80\x94Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\r\njoint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day,\r\nyou know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\r\nentertained before.\xe2\x80\x94I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\r\nof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting\r\neither that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the\r\nmisfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a\r\nlittle attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without\r\nguessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular\r\ncause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the\r\nCampbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and\r\npenance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of\r\ntrying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.\xe2\x80\x94In the summer\r\nit might have passed; but what can any body\xe2\x80\x99s native air do for them in\r\nthe months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages\r\nwould be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and\r\nI dare say in her\xe2\x80\x99s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\r\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell\r\nyou what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npreference of her music to her friend\xe2\x80\x99s, I can answer for being very\r\ndecided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?\xe2\x80\x94A water party;\r\nand by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did. I was there\xe2\x80\x94one of the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you really?\xe2\x80\x94Well!\xe2\x80\x94But you observed nothing of course, for it\r\nseems to be a new idea to you.\xe2\x80\x94If I had been there, I think I should\r\nhave made some discoveries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\r\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon\r\ncaught her.\xe2\x80\x94It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent\r\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durable\xe2\x80\x94indeed I believe\r\nit was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again\xe2\x80\x94yet that\r\nwas too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\r\nobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\r\ndiscoveries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in\r\nthe awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\r\nobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the\r\ntable was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\r\nexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a\r\nlittle more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\r\nsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\r\nconclude it to come from the Campbells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\r\nnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\r\nwould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\r\nconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\r\nDixon is a principal in the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\r\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\r\nyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\r\npaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\r\nBut when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that\r\nit should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see\r\nit in no other light than as an offering of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction\r\nseemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other\r\nsubjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the\r\ndessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired\r\namid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few\r\ndownright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x94nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old\r\nnews, and heavy jokes.\r\n\r\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\r\nladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\r\nof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\r\ndignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\r\nthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\r\ncheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\r\nalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\r\naffection. There she sat\xe2\x80\x94and who would have guessed how many tears she\r\nhad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\r\nseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\r\nnothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\r\ndid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad\r\nto change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\r\nmortification of having loved\xe2\x80\x94yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\r\nvain\xe2\x80\x94by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\r\nbeloved by the husband of her friend.\r\n\r\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\r\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\r\nsecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\r\nand therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\r\nsubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\r\nconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of\r\nguilt which accompanied the name of \xe2\x80\x9cmy excellent friend Colonel\r\nCampbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by\r\nthe circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\r\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\r\nto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\r\nof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\r\nfair heroine\xe2\x80\x99s countenance.\r\n\r\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of\r\nthe early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\r\nhandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\r\nand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the\r\ncircle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\r\nwould not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be\r\nthinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She\r\nintroduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\r\nafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had never seen so\r\nlovely a face, and was delighted with her na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d And she, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly to\r\nbe sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think\r\nthere were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\xe2\x80\x9d Emma restrained her\r\nindignation, and only turned from her in silence.\r\n\r\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\r\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\r\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room\xe2\x80\x94hated\r\nsitting long\xe2\x80\x94was always the first to move when he could\xe2\x80\x94that his\r\nfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\r\nparish business\xe2\x80\x94that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\r\npleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of\r\ngentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury\r\naltogether\xe2\x80\x94thought it so abundant in agreeable families\xe2\x80\x94that Emma began\r\nto feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much. She\r\nquestioned him as to the society in Yorkshire\xe2\x80\x94the extent of the\r\nneighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his\r\nanswers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little\r\ngoing on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,\r\nnone very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations\r\naccepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health\r\nand spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\r\nperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not\r\nwithout difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he\r\ncould get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.\r\n\r\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\r\nits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement\r\nat home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He\r\ndid not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded\r\nhis aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and\r\nnoticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he\r\ncould _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on\r\nwhich his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much\r\nto go abroad\xe2\x80\x94had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel\xe2\x80\x94but she\r\nwould not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he\r\nsaid, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\r\n\r\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\r\ngood behaviour to his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made a most wretched discovery,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after a short pause.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been here a week to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94half my time. I never knew days fly\r\nso fast. A week to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x94And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But\r\njust got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!\xe2\x80\x94I hate the\r\nrecollection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\r\nof so few, in having your hair cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is no subject of regret at all. I have no\r\npleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\r\nseen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\r\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\r\nWhen Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as\r\nbefore, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at\r\nMiss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nHe started. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for rousing me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have\r\nbeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94so very odd a way\xe2\x80\x94that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\r\nany thing so outr\xc3\xa9e!\xe2\x80\x94Those curls!\xe2\x80\x94This must be a fancy of her own. I\r\nsee nobody else looking like her!\xe2\x80\x94I must go and ask her whether it is\r\nan Irish fashion. Shall I?\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I will\xe2\x80\x94I declare I will\xe2\x80\x94and you shall\r\nsee how she takes it;\xe2\x80\x94whether she colours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\r\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as\r\nhe had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\r\nfront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\r\n\r\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the luxury of a large party,\xe2\x80\x9d said she:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cone can get near\r\nevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to\r\nyou. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\r\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\r\nMiss Bates and her niece came here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x94They were invited, were not they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes\xe2\x80\x94but how they were conveyed hither?\xe2\x80\x94the manner of their\r\ncoming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey walked, I conclude. How else could they come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true.\xe2\x80\x94Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it\r\nwould be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\r\ncold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\r\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\r\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\r\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\r\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may\r\nguess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I\r\nmade my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage\r\nwould be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would\r\nbe making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as\r\npossible, you may be sure. \xe2\x80\x98Nobody was ever so fortunate as\r\nherself!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but with many, many thanks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98there was no occasion to trouble\r\nus, for Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s carriage had brought, and was to take them home\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99 I was quite surprized;\xe2\x80\x94very glad, I am sure; but really quite\r\nsurprized. Such a very kind attention\xe2\x80\x94and so thoughtful an\r\nattention!\xe2\x80\x94the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in\r\nshort, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\r\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do\r\nsuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it\r\nwas only as an excuse for assisting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnothing more likely. I know no man more\r\nlikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing\xe2\x80\x94to do any thing\r\nreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\r\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\r\nFairfax\xe2\x80\x99s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;\xe2\x80\x94and for\r\nan act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\r\nmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day\xe2\x80\x94for we arrived\r\ntogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\r\ncould betray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cyou give him credit for more\r\nsimple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while\r\nMiss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have\r\nnever been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more\r\nprobable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.\r\nKnightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you\r\ncompany!\xe2\x80\x94What do you say to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mrs. Weston,\r\nhow could you think of such a thing?\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley!\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley must\r\nnot marry!\xe2\x80\x94You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\r\nno, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am\r\namazed that you should think of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not\r\nwant the match\xe2\x80\x94I do not want to injure dear little Henry\xe2\x80\x94but the idea\r\nhas been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished\r\nto marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry\xe2\x80\x99s account, a boy of\r\nsix years old, who knows nothing of the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley\r\nmarry!\xe2\x80\x94No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.\r\nAnd Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the imprudence of such a match!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\r\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\r\nbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for\r\nthe Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x94and is always glad\r\nto shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to\r\nmatch-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the\r\nAbbey!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! no, no;\xe2\x80\x94every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not\r\nhave him do so mad a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImprudent, if you please\xe2\x80\x94but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\r\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\r\nleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?\xe2\x80\x94He\r\nis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\r\nhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\r\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\r\nhis time or his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\r\nloves Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I\r\nam sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the greatest good he could\r\ndo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\r\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\r\nBates belonging to him?\xe2\x80\x94To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\r\nhim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98So very kind\r\nand obliging!\xe2\x80\x94But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthen fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s old petticoat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that it was such a very old petticoat either\xe2\x80\x94for still it would\r\nlast a great while\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their\r\npetticoats were all very strong.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my\r\nconscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be\r\nmuch disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She\r\nmight talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only\r\ntalk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it\r\nwould be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think\r\nhe does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of\r\nJane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her\xe2\x80\x94his anxiety about her\r\nhealth\xe2\x80\x94his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have\r\nheard him express himself so warmly on those points!\xe2\x80\x94Such an admirer of\r\nher performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him\r\nsay that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost\r\nforgotten one idea that occurred to me\xe2\x80\x94this pianoforte that has been\r\nsent here by somebody\xe2\x80\x94though we have all been so well satisfied to\r\nconsider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.\r\nKnightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person\r\nto do it, even without being in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\r\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\r\nnothing mysteriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\r\noftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\r\ncourse of things, occur to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\r\nher so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very\r\nstrong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly\r\nsilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\r\nmany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve nothing of the pianoforte\xe2\x80\x94and proof only shall convince me that\r\nMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\r\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the\r\nmost used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed\r\nthem that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;\xe2\x80\x94and at the\r\nsame moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do\r\nthem the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the\r\neagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing\r\nnothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.\r\nCole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it\r\nsuited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.\r\n\r\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more\r\nthan she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit\r\nin the little things which are generally acceptable, and could\r\naccompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her\r\nagreeably by surprize\xe2\x80\x94a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank\r\nChurchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and\r\nevery thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful\r\nvoice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and\r\nthat he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly\r\nasserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her\r\nplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,\r\nshe never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely\r\nsuperior to her own.\r\n\r\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\r\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\r\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\r\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\r\nMrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united\r\nvoices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s marrying did not in the least subside. She could see\r\nnothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John\r\nKnightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmost mortifying change, and material loss to them all;\xe2\x80\x94a very great\r\ndeduction from her father\xe2\x80\x99s daily comfort\xe2\x80\x94and, as to herself, she could\r\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\r\nKnightley for them all to give way to!\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley must never\r\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\r\ntalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\r\nvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\r\nstruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\r\nkindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\r\nthe spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate\r\nonly his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often feel concern,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I dare not make our carriage\r\nmore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;\r\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should\r\nput-to for such a purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite out of the question, quite out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut you must often wish it, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d And he smiled with\r\nsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis present from the Campbells,\xe2\x80\x9d said she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis pianoforte is very\r\nkindly given.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and without the smallest apparent\r\nembarrassment.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut they would have done better had they given her\r\nnotice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\r\nenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\r\nexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\r\nhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely\r\nfree from peculiar attachment\xe2\x80\x94whether there were no actual\r\npreference\xe2\x80\x94remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsecond song, her voice grew thick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nsung quite enough for one evening\xe2\x80\x94now be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for. \xe2\x80\x9cOne more;\xe2\x80\x94they would not\r\nfatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd Frank Churchill was heard to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you could manage this\r\nwithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\r\nsong falls on the second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthinks of nothing but shewing off\r\nhis own voice. This must not be.\xe2\x80\x9d And touching Miss Bates, who at that\r\nmoment passed near\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\r\nherself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be\r\ngrateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\r\nsinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss\r\nWoodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but\r\nsoon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing\xe2\x80\x94originating nobody\r\nexactly knew where\xe2\x80\x94was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,\r\nthat every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.\r\nWeston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an\r\nirresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming\r\ngallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\r\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\r\nvoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\r\nKnightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\r\nwere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\r\nsomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to\r\nMrs. Cole\xe2\x80\x94he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody\r\nelse, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\r\n\r\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\r\nshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\r\nfive couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it\r\nmade it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\r\npartner. They were a couple worth looking at.\r\n\r\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\r\ngrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to\r\nbegin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,\r\nand have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it is as well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\r\nher carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cI must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\r\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\r\nafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\r\nmight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\r\nbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\r\nthe Coles\xe2\x80\x94worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!\xe2\x80\x94And left a name\r\nbehind her that would not soon die away.\r\n\r\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\r\npoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\r\ntransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\r\nJane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\r\nhad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his\r\nsubmission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,\r\nwhich made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to\r\nhave held her tongue.\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\r\nthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret\r\nthe inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\r\ngrieve over the idleness of her childhood\xe2\x80\x94and sat down and practised\r\nvigorously an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s coming in; and if Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthan a lamp is like sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear\xe2\x80\x94I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\r\nas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\r\nlast night said how well you played.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\r\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\r\nbut Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s is much beyond it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\r\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\r\nsaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great\r\ndeal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than\r\nexecution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\r\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.\xe2\x80\x94There is no\r\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\r\nknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\r\nteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\r\nany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as they always do\xe2\x80\x94very vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told me something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet rather hesitatingly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is\r\nnothing of any consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\r\nproducing Mr. Elton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told me\xe2\x80\x94that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay\r\nto dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\r\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay\r\nthere again next summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her\r\nat dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to\r\nmarry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely.\xe2\x80\x94I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\r\ngirls in Highbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet had business at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x94Emma thought it most prudent to go with\r\nher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\r\nher present state, would be dangerous.\r\n\r\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\r\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\r\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.\xe2\x80\x94Much could\r\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nPerry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\r\noffice-door, Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\r\nstray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\r\ncould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher\r\nwith his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her\r\nfull basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of\r\ndawdling children round the baker\xe2\x80\x99s little bow-window eyeing the\r\ngingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused\r\nenough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at\r\nease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nShe looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\r\nappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\r\nHighbury;\xe2\x80\x94to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\r\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls\r\nthan Ford\xe2\x80\x99s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\r\neye.\xe2\x80\x94Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\r\nagreeableness of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure\r\nto the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to\r\ncall on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my companion tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I absolutely promised Miss\r\nBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\r\nmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\r\nam going now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFrank Churchill, \xe2\x80\x9cto join your party and wait for her at Hartfield\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou are going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94I may be equally in the\r\nway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt\r\nalways sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to\r\ndeath; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.\r\nWhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here on no business of my own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cI am only waiting for\r\nmy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\r\nBut you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if you advise it.\xe2\x80\x94But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\r\nhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\r\nindifferent tone\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\r\nWeston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would\r\nbe palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the\r\nworld at a civil falsehood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe any such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am persuaded that\r\nyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\r\nthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\r\notherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s opinion last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo come with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be not very disagreeable to\r\nyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We\r\nwill follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\r\nwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\r\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s door. Emma watched them in,\r\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,\xe2\x80\x94trying, with all\r\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\r\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\r\nit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\r\nlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I send it to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs.\r\nFord.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94yes, to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s. Only my pattern gown is at\r\nHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\r\nMrs. Goddard will want to see it.\xe2\x80\x94And I could take the pattern gown\r\nhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly\xe2\x80\x94so it had better go\r\nto Hartfield\xe2\x80\x94at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\r\nMrs. Ford, could not you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\r\nparcels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo trouble in the world, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\r\nplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I do not know\xe2\x80\x94No, I\r\nthink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield,\r\nand take it home with me at night. What do you advise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\r\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, that will be much best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, quite satisfied, \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVoices approached the shop\xe2\x80\x94or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\r\nWeston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cI am just run across to\r\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\r\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\r\ndo you do, Miss Smith?\xe2\x80\x94Very well I thank you.\xe2\x80\x94And I begged Mrs. Weston\r\nto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\r\nand Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?\xe2\x80\x94I am so glad\r\nto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\r\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\r\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\r\nvery happy to see her\xe2\x80\x94and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\r\nrefuse.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Aye, pray do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Frank Churchill, \xe2\x80\x98Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94But, said I, I shall\r\nbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94For, would you\r\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\r\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles.\xe2\x80\x94The rivet\r\ncame out, you know, this morning.\xe2\x80\x94So very obliging!\xe2\x80\x94For my mother had\r\nno use of her spectacles\xe2\x80\x94could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\r\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane\r\nsaid so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I\r\ndid, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one\r\nthing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time\r\nPatty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh,\r\nsaid I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet\r\nof your mistress\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home,\r\nMrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging\r\nto us, the Wallises, always\xe2\x80\x94I have heard some people say that Mrs.\r\nWallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never\r\nknown any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be\r\nfor the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,\r\nyou know? Only three of us.\xe2\x80\x94besides dear Jane at present\xe2\x80\x94and she really\r\neats nothing\xe2\x80\x94makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite\r\nfrightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she\r\neats\xe2\x80\x94so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But\r\nabout the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she\r\nlikes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\r\nfor I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I\r\nhappened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it\r\nis the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly\r\nwholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an\r\nexcellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I\r\nhope, and these ladies will oblige us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma would be \xe2\x80\x9cvery happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.,\xe2\x80\x9d and they did at\r\nlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\r\nI hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\r\ncame back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well\xe2\x80\x94only a\r\nlittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was I talking of?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, beginning again when they were all\r\nin the street.\r\n\r\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndo think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\r\nexcessively.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\r\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\r\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\r\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x98I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\r\nexcessively.\xe2\x80\x99 I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\r\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so\r\nvery obliging as to take some, \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said he directly, \xe2\x80\x98there is\r\nnothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the\r\nfinest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.\xe2\x80\x99 That, you\r\nknow, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no\r\ncompliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis\r\ndoes them full justice\xe2\x80\x94only we do not have them baked more than twice,\r\nand Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nMiss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples\r\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\r\nfrom Donwell\xe2\x80\x94some of Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s most liberal supply. He sends us a\r\nsack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\r\nanywhere as one of his trees\xe2\x80\x94I believe there is two of them. My mother\r\nsays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was\r\nreally quite shocked the other day\xe2\x80\x94for Mr. Knightley called one\r\nmorning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and\r\nsaid how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to\r\nthe end of our stock. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure you must be,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98and I will\r\nsend you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever\r\nuse. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this\r\nyear. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nI begged he would not\xe2\x80\x94for really as to ours being gone, I could not\r\nabsolutely say that we had a great many left\xe2\x80\x94it was but half a dozen\r\nindeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all\r\nbear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been\r\nalready; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost\r\nquarrelled with me\xe2\x80\x94No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a\r\nquarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\r\napples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a\r\ngreat many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.\r\nHowever, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large\r\nbasket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was\r\nvery much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said\r\nevery thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old\r\nacquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found\r\nafterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of\r\n_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all\xe2\x80\x94and now his master\r\nhad not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it\r\nhimself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for\r\nWilliam, you know, thinks more of his master\xe2\x80\x99s profit than any thing;\r\nbut Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent\r\naway. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have\r\nanother apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not\r\nmind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.\r\nHodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were\r\nsold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me,\r\nand I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\r\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\r\nto keep it from Jane\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\r\nbefore I was aware.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\r\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\r\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\r\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase\xe2\x80\x94rather darker and\r\nnarrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\r\nWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\r\nSmith, the step at the turning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\r\ntranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\r\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\r\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\r\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\r\n\r\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\r\nhappy countenance on seeing Emma again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in rather a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming at least\r\nten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\r\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9chave not you finished it yet? you would not\r\nearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been working uninterruptedly,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\r\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\r\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to\r\nbe persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\r\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to\r\nmake her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite\r\nready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately\r\nready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had\r\nnot yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without\r\nemotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and\r\nEmma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could\r\nnot but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\r\n\r\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\r\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\r\nWeston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined\r\nher in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\r\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Churchill, with a\r\nsmile at Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cthe person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\r\nColonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\r\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\r\nparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\r\nfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not\r\nyou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\r\nbeen speaking to her at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, in a whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cmine was a random guess. Do\r\nnot distress her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\r\ndoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on\r\nthis occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and\r\nwonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to\r\nbe going forward just at this time?\xe2\x80\x94Do you imagine it to be the\r\nconsequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have\r\nsent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to\r\ndepend upon contingencies and conveniences?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a voice of\r\nforced calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\r\nall conjecture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConjecture\xe2\x80\x94aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\r\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\r\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at\r\nwork, if one talks at all;\xe2\x80\x94your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\r\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have\r\nthe pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,\r\nhealed for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\r\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\r\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be one of the waltzes we\r\ndanced last night;\xe2\x80\x94let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\r\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\r\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds\xe2\x80\x94all the worlds one ever\r\nhas to give\xe2\x80\x94for another half-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe played.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\r\nhappy!\xe2\x80\x94If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\r\nsomething else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\r\nand turning to Emma, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is something quite new to me. Do you know it?\xe2\x80\x94Cramer.\xe2\x80\x94And here\r\nare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\r\nexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\r\nColonel Campbell, was not it?\xe2\x80\x94He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\r\nhere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\r\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\r\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\r\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the\r\nremains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of\r\nconsciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less\r\nscruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x94This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently\r\ncherishing very reprehensible feelings.\r\n\r\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.\xe2\x80\x94Emma\r\ntook the opportunity of whispering,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak too plain. She must understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\r\nashamed of my meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the\r\nidea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\r\na key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\r\nwrong, she ought to feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not entirely without it, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94_his_ favourite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\r\nKnightley on horse-back not far off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Knightley I declare!\xe2\x80\x94I must speak to him if possible, just to\r\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\r\nbut I can go into my mother\xe2\x80\x99s room you know. I dare say he will come in\r\nwhen he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x94Our little room so honoured!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\r\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and every\r\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others,\r\nas if it had passed within the same apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99 ye do?\xe2\x80\x94how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do?\xe2\x80\x94Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\r\nfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\r\nfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\r\nhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is your niece, Miss Bates?\xe2\x80\x94I want to inquire after you all, but\r\nparticularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?\xe2\x80\x94I hope she caught no cold\r\nlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\r\nher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\r\nEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\r\nsteady scepticism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo obliged to you!\xe2\x80\x94so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed Miss Bates.\r\n\r\nHe cut her short with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! dear, Kingston\xe2\x80\x94are you?\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\r\nwanted something from Kingston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new\r\npianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a deliberating manner, \xe2\x80\x9cfor five minutes, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!\xe2\x80\x94Quite delightful;\r\nso many friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\r\nto Kingston as fast as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear\r\nthe pianoforte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am so sorry!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\r\nnight; how extremely pleasant.\xe2\x80\x94Did you ever see such dancing?\xe2\x80\x94Was not\r\nit delightful?\xe2\x80\x94Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\r\nthing equal to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\r\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\r\nAnd (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\r\nnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\r\nWeston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in\r\nEngland. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\r\nsomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\r\nhear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nshocked!\xe2\x80\x94Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a\r\ngreat many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\r\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\r\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\r\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\r\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to\r\nthe room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.\r\nHe is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cwe heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\r\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\r\nhave heard every thing to be sure. \xe2\x80\x98Can I do any thing for you at\r\nKingston?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must\r\nyou be going?\xe2\x80\x94You seem but just come\xe2\x80\x94so very obliging of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\r\nlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to\r\nbe gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\r\nallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\r\ngates, before they set off for Randalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\r\nknown of young people passing many, many months successively, without\r\nbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\r\neither to body or mind;\xe2\x80\x94but when a beginning is made\xe2\x80\x94when the\r\nfelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\r\n\r\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\r\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\r\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\r\npeople in schemes on the subject. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s was the first idea; and his\r\nthe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of\r\nthe difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and\r\nappearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people\r\nagain how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse\r\ndanced\xe2\x80\x94for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself\r\nwith Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x94and even for simple dancing itself, without any of\r\nthe wicked aids of vanity\xe2\x80\x94to assist him first in pacing out the room\r\nthey were in to see what it could be made to hold\xe2\x80\x94and then in taking\r\nthe dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in\r\nspite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,\r\nthat it was a little the largest.\r\n\r\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshould be finished there\xe2\x80\x94that the same party should be collected, and\r\nthe same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\r\nWeston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\r\nmost willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\r\nand the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly\r\nwho there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of\r\nspace to every couple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\r\nCoxes five,\xe2\x80\x9d had been repeated many times over. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there will be the\r\ntwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\r\nYes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\r\nMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\r\ncouple there will be plenty of room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will there be good room for five couple?\xe2\x80\x94I really do not think\r\nthere will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn another,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\r\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\r\nIt will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\r\nthought of the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\r\nwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\r\nput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one\r\nfamily of cousins who must be included, and another of very old\r\nacquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the\r\nfive couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation\r\nin what possible manner they could be disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. \xe2\x80\x9cMight not\r\nthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed the best\r\nscheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\r\nbetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress\r\nabout the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score\r\nof health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\r\npersevered in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\r\nbear it for Emma!\xe2\x80\x94Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\r\nSo would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\r\nbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\r\nnot let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\r\nthoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\r\nthe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and\r\nkeeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\r\ndraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\r\nquite the thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it,\r\nand said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\r\nclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\r\nin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\r\nFrank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now\r\nendeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were too magnificent,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe allowed unnecessary room. Ten\r\ncouple may stand here very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma demurred. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a crowd\xe2\x80\x94a sad crowd; and what could be\r\nworse than dancing without space to turn in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d he gravely replied; \xe2\x80\x9cit was very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d But still he went\r\non measuring, and still he ended with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\r\nto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to\r\nbe dancing in a crowd\xe2\x80\x94and a crowd in a little room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no denying it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you exactly. A\r\ncrowd in a little room\xe2\x80\x94Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\r\npictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!\xe2\x80\x94Still, however,\r\nhaving proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It\r\nwould be a disappointment to my father\xe2\x80\x94and altogether\xe2\x80\x94I do not know\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\r\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\r\ndancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\r\nHad she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\r\npause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\r\nand the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\r\nacquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\r\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\r\nthe scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d he almost immediately began, \xe2\x80\x9cyour inclination\r\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\r\nof my father\xe2\x80\x99s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nthought of my father\xe2\x80\x99s, which waits only your approbation to be acted\r\nupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\r\nof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\r\nCrown Inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Crown!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you\r\ncannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him\r\nthere. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less\r\ngrateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees\r\nno objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all\r\nfeel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the\r\nRandalls rooms, would have been insufferable!\xe2\x80\x94Dreadful!\xe2\x80\x94I felt how\r\nright you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_\r\n_thing_ to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?\xe2\x80\x94You consent\xe2\x80\x94I hope\r\nyou consent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\r\nmyself, shall be most happy\xe2\x80\x94It seems the only improvement that could\r\nbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\r\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\r\nnecessary to make it acceptable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he thought it very far from an improvement\xe2\x80\x94a very bad plan\xe2\x80\x94much\r\nworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\r\nnever properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\r\nhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the\r\nCrown in his life\xe2\x80\x94did not know the people who kept it by sight.\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\r\nno\xe2\x80\x94a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to observe, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Churchill, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of the\r\ngreat recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of\r\nany body\xe2\x80\x99s catching cold\xe2\x80\x94so much less danger at the Crown than at\r\nRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\r\nnobody else could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very much mistaken\r\nif you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\r\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\r\nthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\r\noccasion to open the windows at all\xe2\x80\x94not once the whole evening; and it\r\nis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\r\nheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the windows!\xe2\x80\x94but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\r\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\r\nheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!\xe2\x80\x94I am sure, neither\r\nyour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! sir\xe2\x80\x94but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\r\nwindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I\r\nhave often known it done myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you indeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x94Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\r\nlive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\r\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\r\nover\xe2\x80\x94but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\r\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\r\nobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\r\ncan be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be plenty of time for talking every\r\nthing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\r\nthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will\r\nbe so near their own stable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\r\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\r\nbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired\xe2\x80\x94but is Mrs. Stokes to be\r\ntrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\r\nunder Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, papa!\xe2\x80\x94Now you must be satisfied\xe2\x80\x94Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\r\nis carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\r\nyears ago, when I had the measles? \xe2\x80\x98If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\r\nwrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 How often have I\r\nheard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\r\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would\r\nhave been very bad, but for Perry\xe2\x80\x99s great attention. He came four times\r\na day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful\r\ncomplaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s little ones have the\r\nmeasles, she will send for Perry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank\r\nChurchill, \xe2\x80\x9cexamining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\r\nand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\r\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\r\ndesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them,\r\nif you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\r\nsatisfactorily without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\r\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\r\nset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWeston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\r\nvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and\r\nhe, finding every thing perfect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthis paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\r\nyou see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\r\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you are too particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does all\r\nthat signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\r\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\r\nclub-nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \xe2\x80\x9cMen never know\r\nwhen things are dirty or not;\xe2\x80\x9d and the gentlemen perhaps thought each\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWomen will have their little nonsenses and needless\r\ncares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It\r\nregarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom\xe2\x80\x99s being built,\r\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\r\nthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\r\nas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by\r\ntheir four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\r\nsupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\r\npurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\r\npassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\r\nWeston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and\r\nneither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\r\nmiserably crowded at supper.\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &amp;c.,\r\nset out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\r\nsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\r\npronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.\r\nWeston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\r\nexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\r\nthrough the passage, was calling out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\r\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cone could know which arrangement our\r\nguests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally\r\npleasing must be our object\xe2\x80\x94if one could but tell what that would be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Frank, \xe2\x80\x9cvery true. You want your neighbours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nopinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\r\nof them\xe2\x80\x94the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\r\nupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.\xe2\x80\x94And I do not know\r\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\r\nthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger\r\ncouncil. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think\r\nshe will be of any use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwill be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\r\nwill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in\r\nconsulting Miss Bates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\r\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\r\nhis decided approbation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, do, Frank.\xe2\x80\x94Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\r\nonce. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a\r\nproperer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss\r\nBates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of\r\nhow to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth sir! Can the old lady?\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a\r\ngreat blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\r\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd away he ran.\r\n\r\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving\r\naunt, and her elegant niece,\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman\r\nand a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of\r\nit much less than she had supposed before\xe2\x80\x94indeed very trifling; and\r\nhere ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation\r\nat least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\r\nchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\r\nas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\r\nStokes.\xe2\x80\x94Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\r\nwritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\r\nwhich could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As\r\na counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\r\ncharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and\r\nminute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\r\nhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different\r\nrooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of\r\nthe future. The party did not break up without Emma\xe2\x80\x99s being positively\r\nsecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor\r\nwithout her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has asked\r\nher, my dear. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. I knew he would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\r\nsatisfactory to Emma\xe2\x80\x94its being fixed for a day within the granted term\r\nof Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\r\nChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\r\nfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\r\ntheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\r\nentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\r\nhoping in uncertainty\xe2\x80\x94at the risk\xe2\x80\x94in her opinion, the great risk, of\r\nits being all in vain.\r\n\r\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\r\nwish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not\r\nopposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\r\nsolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of\r\nher ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s provoking\r\nindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\r\nbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed\r\nresolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\r\nexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\r\nTo her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\r\nthan,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\r\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\r\nagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! yes, I\r\nmust be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I\r\ncan; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s account; much rather, I confess.\xe2\x80\x94Pleasure in seeing dancing!\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nI, indeed\xe2\x80\x94I never look at it\xe2\x80\x94I do not know who does.\xe2\x80\x94Fine dancing, I\r\nbelieve, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by\r\nare usually thinking of something very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was\r\nnot in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,\r\nor so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the\r\nball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.\r\nIt made her animated\xe2\x80\x94open hearted\xe2\x80\x94she voluntarily said;\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\r\nWhat a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\r\n_very_ great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\r\npreferred the society of William Larkins. No!\xe2\x80\x94she was more and more\r\nconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There\r\nwas a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94but no love.\r\n\r\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\r\ndays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\r\nevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell\xe2\x80\x94far too unwell to do without\r\nhim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when\r\nwriting to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\r\nunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\r\nherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\r\nand must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\r\n\r\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\r\nWeston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\r\nwithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\r\nto lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred\r\nbut for her own convenience.\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he could only allow himself time to hurry to\r\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom\r\nhe could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\r\nexpected at Hartfield very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast. When once it had\r\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\r\nloss of the ball\xe2\x80\x94the loss of the young man\xe2\x80\x94and all that the young man\r\nmight be feeling!\xe2\x80\x94It was too wretched!\xe2\x80\x94Such a delightful evening as it\r\nwould have been!\xe2\x80\x94Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\r\nhappiest!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI said it would be so,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only consolation.\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\r\nMrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and\r\nas for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but\r\nthey would all be safer at home.\r\n\r\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if\r\nthis reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total\r\nwant of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going\r\naway almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\r\nsat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\r\nhimself, it was only to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will come again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will not be your only visit\r\nto Randalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94(shaking his head)\xe2\x80\x94the uncertainty of when I may be able to\r\nreturn!\xe2\x80\x94I shall try for it with a zeal!\xe2\x80\x94It will be the object of all my\r\nthoughts and cares!\xe2\x80\x94and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI am afraid\xe2\x80\x94they did not stir last spring\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid it is a custom\r\ngone for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur poor ball must be quite given up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that ball!\xe2\x80\x94why did we wait for any thing?\xe2\x80\x94why not seize the\r\npleasure at once?\xe2\x80\x94How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\r\nfoolish preparation!\xe2\x80\x94You told us it would be so.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\r\nwhy are you always so right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\r\nrather have been merry than wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\r\non it. Do not forget your engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma looked graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a fortnight as it has been!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cevery day more\r\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!\xe2\x80\x94every day making me\r\nless fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\r\nHighbury!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you do us such ample justice now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\r\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\r\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\r\ncoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\r\nwas convinced that it had been so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you must be off this very morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\r\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will\r\nbring him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\r\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s powerful, argumentative mind might\r\nhave strengthened yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\r\nwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\r\nby Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\r\nto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\r\nlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay\r\nmy visit, then\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps, Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94I think you can hardly be\r\nquite without suspicion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\r\nwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\r\nserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,\r\nin the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\r\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\r\nhim sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\r\nHe could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\r\npassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given\r\nto Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.\xe2\x80\x94He was more\r\nin love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\r\nhave ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\r\nsoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\r\n\r\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\r\nWeston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\r\nprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\r\nwas doubtful, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was time to go;\xe2\x80\x9d and the young man, though he\r\nmight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall hear about you all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is my chief consolation. I\r\nshall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\r\nMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\r\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\r\ninterested in the absent!\xe2\x80\x94she will tell me every thing. In her letters\r\nI shall be at dear Highbury again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d closed\r\nthe speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had\r\nbeen the notice\xe2\x80\x94short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so\r\nsorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from\r\nhis absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\r\narrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the\r\nlast two weeks\xe2\x80\x94indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of\r\nseeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\r\nattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\r\nfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\r\ncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he\r\nhad _almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what\r\nconstancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but\r\nat present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,\r\na conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all\r\nthe rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him,\r\nin spite of every previous determination against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly must,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cThis sensation of listlessness,\r\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ\r\nmyself, this feeling of every thing\xe2\x80\x99s being dull and insipid about the\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x94 I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world\r\nif I were not\xe2\x80\x94for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always\r\ngood to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not\r\nfor Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the\r\nevening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not\r\nsay that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would\r\nhave contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that\r\nhe was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with\r\nconsiderable kindness added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really\r\nout of luck; you are very much out of luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\r\nregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was\r\nodious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\r\nheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\r\ntaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\r\ncharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\r\nill-health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\r\nonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\r\ndeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\r\nFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than\r\never in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,\r\nand quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how\r\nwere his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his\r\ncoming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could\r\nnot admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be\r\nless disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and\r\ncheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have\r\nfaults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat\r\ndrawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress\r\nand close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and\r\ninventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary\r\ndeclaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection\r\nwas always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming\r\nwas to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became\r\nsensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in\r\nlove; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to\r\nquit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must\r\nproduce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIn not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\r\nthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\r\nreally necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\r\nnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love.\r\nI should be sorry to be more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love\xe2\x80\x94every thing denotes it\xe2\x80\x94very much\r\nin love indeed!\xe2\x80\x94and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I\r\nmust be on my guard not to encourage it.\xe2\x80\x94It would be most inexcusable\r\nto do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I imagine he\r\ncan think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had believed\r\nme at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched.\r\nCould he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at\r\nparting would have been different.\xe2\x80\x94Still, however, I must be on my\r\nguard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it\r\nnow is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him\r\nto be quite the sort of man\xe2\x80\x94I do not altogether build upon his\r\nsteadiness or constancy.\xe2\x80\x94His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them\r\nrather changeable.\xe2\x80\x94Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes\r\nme thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.\xe2\x80\x94I shall do\r\nvery well again after a little while\xe2\x80\x94and then, it will be a good thing\r\nover; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I\r\nshall have been let off easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\r\nshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at\r\nfirst shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\r\nundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\r\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\r\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and\r\ndescribing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\r\nattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\r\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\r\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\r\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\r\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much\r\nmore might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\ncharm of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more\r\nthan once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either\r\na compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and\r\nin the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by\r\nany such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\r\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\r\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\r\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\r\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\r\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\r\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\r\n\r\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\r\npart, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\r\nto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she\r\ncould still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without\r\nher. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew\r\nmore interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent\r\nconsolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words\r\nwhich clothed it, the \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful little friend,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested to her the\r\nidea of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s succeeding her in his affections. Was it\r\nimpossible?\xe2\x80\x94No.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\r\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of\r\nher face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\r\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.\xe2\x80\x94For\r\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not dwell upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI must not think of it. I know\r\nthe danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\r\nhappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\r\nwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\r\nfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, though it\r\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that\r\nquarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s arrival had succeeded Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest\r\ninterest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank\r\nChurchill\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s concerns were assuming the most\r\nirresistible form.\xe2\x80\x94His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among\r\nthem again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over\r\nthe first letter from Enscombe before \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton and his bride\xe2\x80\x9d was in\r\nevery body\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick\r\nat the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.\r\nElton; and Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been\r\nlately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s ball in view at least, there\r\nhad been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now\r\ntoo evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as\r\ncould stand against the actual approach\xe2\x80\x94new carriage, bell-ringing, and\r\nall.\r\n\r\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\r\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\r\ngive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet\r\nhad a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy\r\nwork to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever\r\nagreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet\r\nlistened submissively, and said \xe2\x80\x9cit was very true\xe2\x80\x94it was just as Miss\r\nWoodhouse described\xe2\x80\x94it was not worth while to think about them\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nwould not think about them any longer\xe2\x80\x9d but no change of subject could\r\navail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the\r\nEltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\r\nYou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It\r\nwas all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x94Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you\xe2\x80\x94and it will be a\r\npainful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\r\nforgetting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\r\nexclamation. Emma continued,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\r\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\r\nwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than\r\nmy comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is\r\nyour duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the\r\nsuspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your\r\ntranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.\r\nThey are very important\xe2\x80\x94and sorry I am that you cannot feel them\r\nsufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very\r\nsecondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.\r\nPerhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what\r\nwas due\xe2\x80\x94or rather what would be kind by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\r\nwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\r\nloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\r\nof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt\r\nto what was right and support her in it very tolerably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life\xe2\x80\x94Want\r\ngratitude to you!\xe2\x80\x94Nobody is equal to you!\xe2\x80\x94I care for nobody as I do for\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\r\nmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\r\nwell, nor valued her affection so highly before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said she afterwards\r\nto herself. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and\r\ntenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all\r\nthe clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.\r\nIt is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\r\nbeloved\xe2\x80\x94which gives Isabella all her popularity.\xe2\x80\x94I have it not\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nknow how to prize and respect it.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet is my superior in all the\r\ncharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!\xe2\x80\x94I would not change\r\nyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\r\nbreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x94Harriet is worth a\r\nhundred such\xe2\x80\x94And for a wife\xe2\x80\x94a sensible man\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94it is invaluable. I\r\nmention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\r\ninterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\r\nit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\r\nsettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\r\nnot pretty at all.\r\n\r\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to\r\nmake her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she\r\nmade a point of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s going with her, that the worst of the\r\nbusiness might be gone through as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\r\nwhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\r\nlace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\r\nwould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\r\nnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too;\r\nbut she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The\r\nvisit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and\r\noccupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself\r\nentirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,\r\nbeyond the nothing-meaning terms of being \xe2\x80\x9celegantly dressed, and very\r\npleasing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\r\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;\xe2\x80\x94ease, but not elegance.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\r\nwas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\r\nbut neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\r\nthought at least it would turn out so.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear\xe2\x80\x94but no, she would not\r\npermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was\r\nan awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a\r\nman had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\r\nwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\r\nprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\r\ndepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\r\nElton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\r\nmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\r\nbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\r\nlittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, when they had quitted the house,\r\nand after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss\r\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?\xe2\x80\x94Is not she\r\nvery charming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes\xe2\x80\x94very\xe2\x80\x94a very pleasing young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing to surprize one at all.\xe2\x80\x94A pretty fortune; and\r\nshe came in his way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Harriet, sighing again, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say she was very\r\nmuch attached to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she might; but it is not every man\xe2\x80\x99s fate to marry the woman\r\nwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought\r\nthis the best offer she was likely to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cand well she might, nobody could ever\r\nhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\r\nWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\r\nsuperior as ever;\xe2\x80\x94but being married, you know, it is quite a different\r\nthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit\r\nand admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not\r\nthrown himself away, is such a comfort!\xe2\x80\x94She does seem a charming young\r\nwoman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her \xe2\x80\x98Augusta.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHow delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\r\nmore and judge better. From Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s happening not to be at Hartfield,\r\nand her father\xe2\x80\x99s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\r\nof an hour of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s conversation to herself, and could composedly\r\nattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs.\r\nElton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\r\nthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be\r\nvery superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school,\r\npert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of\r\npeople, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant,\r\nand that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\r\n\r\nHarriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\r\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\r\nmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\r\nher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\r\nalliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\r\n\r\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother\r\nMr. Suckling\xe2\x80\x99s seat;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\r\ngrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\r\nmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by\r\nthe size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\r\nimagine. \xe2\x80\x9cVery like Maple Grove indeed!\xe2\x80\x94She was quite struck by the\r\nlikeness!\xe2\x80\x94That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at\r\nMaple Grove; her sister\xe2\x80\x99s favourite room.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton was appealed\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWas not it astonishingly like?\xe2\x80\x94She could really almost fancy\r\nherself at Maple Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the staircase\xe2\x80\x94You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\r\nstaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\r\ncould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\r\ndelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial\r\nto as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a\r\nlittle sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body\r\nwho sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a\r\nhome. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\r\nunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\r\nwhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils\r\nof matrimony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\r\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\r\nThe laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\r\nvery much in the same way\xe2\x80\x94just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of\r\na fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\r\nmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\r\nwho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\r\nin the same style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\r\npeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\r\nextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to\r\nattack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\r\nyou have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\r\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\r\ncounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\r\nSurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I fancy not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever heard any county but Surry called so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was silenced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or\r\nsummer at farthest,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Elton; \xe2\x80\x9cand that will be our time\r\nfor exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I\r\ndare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds\r\nfour perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_\r\ncarriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely\r\nwell. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season\r\nof the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly\r\nrecommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much\r\npreferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you\r\nknow, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as\r\npossible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored\r\nto King\xe2\x80\x99s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,\r\njust after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many\r\nparties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\r\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and\r\nwe are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at\r\nhome than engage in schemes of pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\r\nbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at\r\nMaple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to\r\nBristol, \xe2\x80\x98I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I\r\nabsolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the\r\nbarouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her\r\nown good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.\xe2\x80\x99 Many a time\r\nhas she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I\r\nthink, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from\r\nsociety, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to\r\nmix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too\r\nmuch or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,\r\nMiss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father\xe2\x80\x99s state of\r\nhealth must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?\xe2\x80\x94Indeed he\r\nshould. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of\r\nits doing Mr. Woodhouse good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\r\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\r\ndoes not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\r\nwaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\r\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\r\nthat it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s spirits,\r\nwhich, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\r\nrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\r\non them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\r\nunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\r\nso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\r\nsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\r\nacquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\r\nalways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\r\nattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of\r\nher being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\r\n_introduction_\xe2\x80\x94of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\r\nof Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help\r\nof a boarder, just made a shift to live!\xe2\x80\x94The dignity of Miss Woodhouse,\r\nof Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\r\n\r\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\r\nhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut their going to\r\nBath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced\r\nthat the place might suit her better than her father.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, to\r\nprevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these\r\noccasions, a lady\xe2\x80\x99s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has\r\nlong known that you are a superior performer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\r\nperformer!\xe2\x80\x94very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a\r\nquarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\r\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94passionately fond;\xe2\x80\x94and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of\r\ntaste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\r\n_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\r\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\r\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\r\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life\r\nto me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\r\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\r\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,\r\nand expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\r\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too\xe2\x80\x94knowing what I had\r\nbeen accustomed to\xe2\x80\x94of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\r\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\r\n_world_ I could give up\xe2\x80\x94parties, balls, plays\xe2\x80\x94for I had no fear of\r\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\r\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who\r\nhad no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me\r\nquite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used\r\nto, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal\r\nto any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed\r\nto every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages\r\nwere not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without\r\nsomething of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but\r\nwithout music, life would be a blank to me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Elton would hesitate\r\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\r\nI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\r\npardoned, in consideration of the motive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\r\nfind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\r\nconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\r\nmusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\r\nWill not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\r\nnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\r\nparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\r\npractice; for married women, you know\xe2\x80\x94there is a sad story against\r\nthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, who are so extremely fond of it\xe2\x80\x94there can be no danger,\r\nsurely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope not; but really when I look around among my\r\nacquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music\xe2\x80\x94never\r\ntouches the instrument\xe2\x80\x94though she played sweetly. And the same may be\r\nsaid of Mrs. Jeffereys\xe2\x80\x94Clara Partridge, that was\xe2\x80\x94and of the two\r\nMilmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can\r\nenumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to\r\nbe quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a\r\nmarried woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was\r\nhalf an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut every thing of that kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cwill soon be in so regular\r\na train\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\r\nmore to say; and, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been calling at Randalls,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand found them both at\r\nhome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\r\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature\xe2\x80\x94quite a first-rate favourite\r\nwith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good\xe2\x80\x94there is\r\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\r\ndirectly. She was your governess, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\r\nwaited for the affirmative before she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\r\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s manners,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cwere always particularly good.\r\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\r\nmodel for any young woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who do you think came in while we were there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhow could she possibly guess?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnightley!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Elton; \xe2\x80\x9cKnightley himself!\xe2\x80\x94Was not it\r\nlucky?\xe2\x80\x94for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\r\nseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nI had a great curiosity. \xe2\x80\x98My friend Knightley\xe2\x80\x99 had been so often\r\nmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\r\ncaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his\r\nfriend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.\r\nDecidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHappily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsufferable woman!\xe2\x80\x9d was her immediate exclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cWorse than I had\r\nsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!\xe2\x80\x94I could not have believed\r\nit. Knightley!\xe2\x80\x94never seen him in her life before, and call him\r\nKnightley!\xe2\x80\x94and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\r\nvulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\r\nresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\r\nActually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\r\nhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\r\nnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\r\nform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\r\nWeston!\xe2\x80\x94Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\r\ngentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\r\nmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\r\nChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\r\nwould be! Ah! there I am\xe2\x80\x94thinking of him directly. Always the first\r\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\r\nas regularly into my mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her\r\nfather had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons\xe2\x80\x99 departure,\r\nand was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he deliberately began, \xe2\x80\x9cconsidering we never saw her\r\nbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\r\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\r\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I\r\nam nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\r\npoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\r\nyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\r\nhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\r\nhaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion;\r\nI said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought\r\nto have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it\r\nshews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into\r\nVicarage Lane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: but a young lady\xe2\x80\x94a bride\xe2\x80\x94I ought to have paid my respects to her\r\nif possible. It was being very deficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\r\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\r\nbe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\r\nmake so much of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\r\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady\xe2\x80\x94and a bride, especially,\r\nis never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\r\nknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\r\nthey may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\r\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\r\nsuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common\r\npoliteness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\r\nencouragement to people to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\r\n_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s offences, and long, very long,\r\ndid they occupy her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\r\nopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\r\nMrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\r\nwhenever they met again,\xe2\x80\x94self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\r\nand ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but\r\nso little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\r\nknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\r\nand conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s consequence only could surpass.\r\n\r\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\r\nfrom his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had\r\nthe air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to\r\nHighbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part\r\nof her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of\r\njudging, following the lead of Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s good-will, or taking it for\r\ngranted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she\r\nprofessed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npraise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by\r\nMiss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked\r\nwith a good grace of her being \xe2\x80\x9cvery pleasant and very elegantly\r\ndressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\r\nfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.\xe2\x80\x94Offended, probably, by the\r\nlittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\r\nback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\r\nthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\r\nnecessarily increasing Emma\xe2\x80\x99s dislike. Her manners, too\xe2\x80\x94and Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\r\nnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s cure; but the\r\nsensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x94It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s attachment had been\r\nan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,\r\nunder a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to\r\nhim, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the\r\nobject of their joint dislike.\xe2\x80\x94When they had nothing else to say, it\r\nmust be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity\r\nwhich they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader\r\nvent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\r\nmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\r\nrecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\r\nwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration\xe2\x80\x94but without\r\nsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\r\nbefriend her.\xe2\x80\x94Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\r\nthird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s knight-errantry\r\non the subject.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.\xe2\x80\x94I quite rave\r\nabout Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\r\nladylike\xe2\x80\x94and with such talents!\xe2\x80\x94I assure you I think she has very\r\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\r\nwell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\r\nis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth\xe2\x80\x94but, upon my word,\r\nI talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94And her situation is so calculated\r\nto affect one!\xe2\x80\x94Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to\r\ndo something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\r\nmust not be suffered to remain unknown.\xe2\x80\x94I dare say you have heard those\r\ncharming lines of the poet,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98And waste its fragrance on the desert air.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think there is any danger of it,\xe2\x80\x9d was Emma\xe2\x80\x99s calm answer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhen you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s situation and\r\nunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\r\nhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\r\nobscurity, so thrown away.\xe2\x80\x94Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\r\nwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\r\nI am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\r\nfeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must\r\nconfess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\r\ntimidity\xe2\x80\x94and I am sure one does not often meet with it.\xe2\x80\x94But in those\r\nwho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\r\nyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\r\nthan I can express.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to feel a great deal\xe2\x80\x94but I am not aware how you or any of\r\nMiss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her\r\nlonger than yourself, can shew her any other attention than\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\r\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\r\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\r\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\r\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\r\nleast inconvenient.\xe2\x80\x94I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\r\nsend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\r\nthan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\r\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\r\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\r\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\r\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be\xe2\x80\x94for we do not\r\nat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.\xe2\x80\x94However, my\r\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94I shall certainly have\r\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\r\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\r\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\r\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her\r\nshortly.\xe2\x80\x94I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\r\nbrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\r\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\r\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of\r\neither but what is highly conciliating.\xe2\x80\x94I shall have her very often\r\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\r\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Jane Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94thought Emma.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not deserved this. You may\r\nhave done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\r\nbeyond what you can have merited!\xe2\x80\x94The kindness and protection of Mrs.\r\nElton!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x99 Heavens! Let me not suppose\r\nthat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!\xe2\x80\x94But upon my honour,\r\nthere seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman\xe2\x80\x99s tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again\xe2\x80\x94to any so exclusively\r\naddressed to herself\xe2\x80\x94so disgustingly decorated with a \xe2\x80\x9cdear Miss\r\nWoodhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d The change on Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s side soon afterwards appeared,\r\nand she was left in peace\xe2\x80\x94neither forced to be the very particular\r\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s guidance, the very active\r\npatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\r\nway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\r\n\r\nShe looked on with some amusement.\xe2\x80\x94Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude for Mrs.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\r\nsimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies\xe2\x80\x94the most\r\namiable, affable, delightful woman\xe2\x80\x94just as accomplished and\r\ncondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nsurprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and\r\ntolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with\r\nthe Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!\r\nThis was astonishing!\xe2\x80\x94She could not have believed it possible that the\r\ntaste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and\r\nfriendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a riddle, quite a riddle!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo chuse to remain here\r\nmonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\r\nmortification of Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s notice and the penury of her\r\nconversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have\r\nalways loved her with such real, generous affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\r\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\r\npromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\r\ninvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\r\nBates\xe2\x80\x94it all came from her\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\r\nWould Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\r\ncontrived\xe2\x80\x94no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\r\ndeclined it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\r\nthis invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d was Emma\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must be under some sort\r\nof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is\r\ngreat fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.\xe2\x80\x94She is _not_ to\r\nbe with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must\r\nshe consent to be with the Eltons?\xe2\x80\x94Here is quite a separate puzzle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\r\nthe few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\r\napology for Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my\r\ndear Emma\xe2\x80\x94but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\r\ngood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\r\nmust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\r\nwhat she goes to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Mrs. Weston,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fairfax\r\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\r\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\r\nher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions\r\nfrom Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\r\nwas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch attentions as Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s, I should have imagined, would rather\r\ndisgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s invitations I should\r\nhave imagined any thing but inviting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cif Miss Fairfax were to have\r\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness in\r\naccepting Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very\r\nlikely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\r\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\r\nspite of the very natural wish of a little change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\r\nminutes silence, he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother thing must be taken into consideration too\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Elton does not\r\ntalk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\r\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\r\namongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\r\ncivility in our personal intercourse with each other\xe2\x80\x94a something more\r\nearly implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\r\nmay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\r\nAnd besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\r\nsure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\r\nand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\r\nrespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\r\nnever fell in Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s way before\xe2\x80\x94and no degree of vanity can\r\nprevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\r\nnot in consciousness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. Little Henry\r\nwas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\r\nirresolute what else to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cany body may know how highly I think of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\r\nstopping\xe2\x80\x94it was better, however, to know the worst at once\xe2\x80\x94she hurried\r\non\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\r\nis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\r\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\r\nsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! are you there?\xe2\x80\x94But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\r\na hint of it six weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\xe2\x80\x94Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\r\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\r\nsay, would not have me if I were to ask her\xe2\x80\x94and I am very sure I shall\r\nnever ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma returned her friend\xe2\x80\x99s pressure with interest; and was pleased\r\nenough to exclaim,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful\xe2\x80\x94and in a manner which\r\nshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\r\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just\r\nnow, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without\r\nany idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the\r\nsmallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You\r\nwould not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were\r\nmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\r\nme by surprize.\xe2\x80\x94I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And soon afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cJane Fairfax is a very charming young\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\r\nnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cand you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\r\nhe asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\r\nwittier than his neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\r\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nshe calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\r\nin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley\xe2\x80\x94what can she do for Mr.\r\nCole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her\r\ncivilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\r\nweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\r\nof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\r\nMiss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\r\nbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\r\nI cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\r\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\r\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\r\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\r\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane Fairfax has feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do not accuse her of\r\nwant of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong\xe2\x80\x94and her\r\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\r\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\r\nshe used to be\xe2\x80\x94And I love an open temper. No\xe2\x80\x94till Cole alluded to my\r\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\r\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always\xe2\x80\x94but with no\r\nthought beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Weston,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma triumphantly when he left them, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do\r\nyou say now to Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Jane Fairfax?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\r\nidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\r\nwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\r\ndisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\r\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\r\nin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\r\nnever to have a disengaged day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI see what a life I am to lead among you.\r\nUpon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\r\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\r\nformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\r\ndisengaged day!\xe2\x80\x94A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\r\nbeen at a loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\r\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\r\ndinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\r\nthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\r\ncard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\r\ngood deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon\r\nshew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the\r\nspring she must return their civilities by one very superior party\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nwhich her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\r\nunbroken packs in the true style\xe2\x80\x94and more waiters engaged for the\r\nevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\r\nrefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\r\n\r\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\r\nHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\r\nshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\r\nresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\r\nten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\r\nusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\r\nwith the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\r\n\r\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons,\r\nit must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\r\nbe asked to make the eighth:\xe2\x80\x94but this invitation was not given with\r\nequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\r\nby Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s begging to be allowed to decline it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe would rather not\r\nbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able\r\nto see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\r\nuncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\r\nrather stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\r\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\r\nfortitude of her little friend\xe2\x80\x94for fortitude she knew it was in her to\r\ngive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\r\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was\r\nmore conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\r\nbeen.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\r\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very true,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cat least as far as relates to me, which\r\nwas all that was meant\xe2\x80\x94and it is very shameful.\xe2\x80\x94Of the same age\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nalways knowing her\xe2\x80\x94I ought to have been more her friend.\xe2\x80\x94She will never\r\nlike me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her greater\r\nattention than I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x94The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\r\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\r\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\r\nweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\r\nstaying one whole day at Hartfield\xe2\x80\x94which one day would be the very day\r\nof this party.\xe2\x80\x94His professional engagements did not allow of his being\r\nput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\r\nso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\r\nutmost that his nerves could bear\xe2\x80\x94and here would be a ninth\xe2\x80\x94and Emma\r\napprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\r\nbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\r\nfalling in with a dinner-party.\r\n\r\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\r\nrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he\r\nalways said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\r\nimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\r\nhave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\r\ninstead of his brother.\r\n\r\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\r\nKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\r\nmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\r\nevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\r\nand the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\r\nphilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\r\nchief of even Emma\xe2\x80\x99s vexation.\r\n\r\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\r\nKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\r\nagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\r\nwaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as\r\nelegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\r\nsilence\xe2\x80\x94wanting only to observe enough for Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s information\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\r\ntalk to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a\r\nwalk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It\r\nwas natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\r\nsure you must have been wet.\xe2\x80\x94We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\r\nturned directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went only to the post-office,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand reached home before\r\nthe rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters\r\nwhen I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A\r\nwalk before breakfast does me good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\r\nyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and\r\nHenry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.\r\nThe post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you\r\nhave lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth\r\ngoing through the rain for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\r\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\r\nolder should make me indifferent about letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndifferent! Oh! no\xe2\x80\x94I never conceived you could become indifferent.\r\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\r\npositive curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\r\nfriendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often thought them the worst of the two,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he coolly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\r\ncan easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\r\nto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes\r\nthe difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body\r\ndearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and\r\ntherefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I\r\nthink, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of\r\nyears,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cI meant to imply the change of situation\r\nwhich time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time\r\nwill generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the\r\ndaily circle\xe2\x80\x94but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an\r\nold friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years\r\nhence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant \xe2\x80\x9cthank\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\r\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\r\nnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on\r\nsuch occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his\r\nparticular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her\xe2\x80\x94and with all\r\nhis mildest urbanity, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\r\nin the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.\xe2\x80\x94Young ladies\r\nare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\r\ncomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\r\nsolicitude about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\r\nold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\r\ndo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are\r\nboth highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\r\nsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\r\nhad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\r\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Jane, what is this I hear?\xe2\x80\x94Going to the post-office in the\r\nrain!\xe2\x80\x94This must not be, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x94You sad girl, how could you do\r\nsuch a thing?\xe2\x80\x94It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\r\nhow to take care of yourself.\xe2\x80\x94To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\r\ndid you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\r\nauthority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly do\r\nfeel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.\xe2\x80\x94Liable\r\nas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\r\ncareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\r\nrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\r\nhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your\r\ncough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are\r\nmuch too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\xe2\x80\x9d eagerly rejoined Mrs.\r\nElton. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not allow her to do such a thing again:\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and nodding\r\nsignificantly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\r\nI shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\r\n(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\r\nbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and\r\nfrom _us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to\r\naccept such an accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are extremely kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot give up my early\r\nwalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\r\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\r\nscarcely ever had a bad morning before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\r\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\r\nwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\r\nyou and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\r\nmyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\r\nmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\r\nsettled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot by any means consent to\r\nsuch an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the\r\nerrand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is\r\nwhen I am not here, by my grandmama\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!\xe2\x80\x94And it is a kindness to\r\nemploy our men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\r\nanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe post-office is a wonderful establishment!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\r\nand all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly very well regulated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a\r\nletter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\r\nkingdom, is even carried wrong\xe2\x80\x94and not one in a million, I suppose,\r\nactually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\r\nhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clerks grow expert from habit.\xe2\x80\x94They must begin with some quickness\r\nof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\r\nexplanation,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are paid for it. That is the\r\nkey to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\r\nobservations made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard it asserted,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the same sort of\r\nhandwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\r\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\r\nthe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have\r\nvery little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand\r\nthey can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I\r\nhave not always known their writing apart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a likeness. I know what\r\nyou mean\xe2\x80\x94but Emma\xe2\x80\x99s hand is the strongest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsabella and Emma both write beautifully,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Woodhouse; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with half a sigh and half a\r\nsmile at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw any gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Emma began, looking also at\r\nMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\r\nto some one else\xe2\x80\x94and the pause gave her time to reflect, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, how am I\r\ngoing to introduce him?\xe2\x80\x94Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\r\nbefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\r\nphrase?\xe2\x80\x94Your Yorkshire friend\xe2\x80\x94your correspondent in Yorkshire;\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.\xe2\x80\x94No, I can pronounce\r\nhis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x94Now for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Frank Churchill\r\nwrites one of the best gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hands I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not admire it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too small\xe2\x80\x94wants\r\nstrength. It is like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\r\nthe base aspersion. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it by no means wanted strength\xe2\x80\x94it was not a\r\nlarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston\r\nany letter about her to produce?\xe2\x80\x9d No, she had heard from him very\r\nlately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were in the other room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had my writing-desk, I\r\nam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.\xe2\x80\x94Do not you\r\nremember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe chose to say he was employed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\r\nMr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nKnightley dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cwrites to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will,\r\nof course, put forth his best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinner was on table.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\r\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\r\nallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\r\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\r\nthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\r\n_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in\r\nfull expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had\r\nnot been in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness\r\nthan usual\xe2\x80\x94a glow both of complexion and spirits.\r\n\r\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\r\nexpense of the Irish mails;\xe2\x80\x94it was at her tongue\xe2\x80\x99s end\xe2\x80\x94but she\r\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should\r\nhurt Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of\r\nthe room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming\r\nto the beauty and grace of each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\r\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nso much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\r\nJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be\r\nalmost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\r\nleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon\r\nbegan again; and though much that passed between them was in a\r\nhalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s side, there was no avoiding a\r\nknowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office\xe2\x80\x94catching\r\ncold\xe2\x80\x94fetching letters\xe2\x80\x94and friendship, were long under discussion; and\r\nto them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x94inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\r\nsuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s meditated activity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is April come!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI get quite anxious about you. June\r\nwill soon be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have never fixed on June or any other month\xe2\x80\x94merely looked\r\nforward to the summer in general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut have you really heard of nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\r\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI not aware!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, shaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cdear Mrs. Elton, who can\r\nhave thought of it as I have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\r\nhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\r\na vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\r\nMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\r\nbody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first\r\ncircle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable!\r\nOf all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge\xe2\x80\x99s is the one I would most wish\r\nto see you in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJane. \xe2\x80\x9cI must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\r\nit;\xe2\x80\x94afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\r\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\r\ntrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\r\nmore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\r\na day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\r\nfor any thing eligible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;\r\ntill the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\r\nor say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\r\nus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you\r\ndeserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday\r\noccurrence, is not obtained at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice; indeed, indeed, we\r\nmust begin inquiring directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\r\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.\r\nWhen I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of\r\nbeing long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\r\nwould soon produce something\xe2\x80\x94Offices for the sale\xe2\x80\x94not quite of human\r\nflesh\xe2\x80\x94but of human intellect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\r\nthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend\r\nto the abolition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jane;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgoverness-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\r\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\r\nthe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I\r\nonly mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\r\napplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\r\nsomething that would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that would do!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Elton. \xe2\x80\x9cAye, _that_ may suit\r\nyour humble ideas of yourself;\xe2\x80\x94I know what a modest creature you are;\r\nbut it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\r\nthing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\r\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it\r\nwould be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\r\nthink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\r\nA gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s family is all that I should condition for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\r\nbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\r\non my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\r\nfirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\r\nyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\r\nas much as you chose;\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94I do not know\xe2\x80\x94if you knew the harp, you\r\nmight do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;\xe2\x80\x94yes, I\r\nreally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you\r\nchose;\xe2\x80\x94and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\r\ncomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a\r\nsituation together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are pretty sure to be equal;\r\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at\r\npresent for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\r\nobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\r\nnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\r\nshall remain where I am, and as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am quite serious too, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\r\nwatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till\r\nMr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of\r\nobject, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!\xe2\x80\x94Only think of his\r\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!\xe2\x80\x94what a dear creature he\r\nis;\xe2\x80\x94I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\r\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\r\nmodern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\r\nyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\r\nbegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am\r\nrather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94Selina\xe2\x80\x99s choice\xe2\x80\x94handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is\r\nnot over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\r\nover-trimmed\xe2\x80\x94quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\r\nnow, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\r\na bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of\r\ndress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\r\nminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,\xe2\x80\x94show\r\nand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\r\ntrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\r\nlook well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\r\nWeston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late\r\ndinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too\r\nmuch expected by the best judges, for surprize\xe2\x80\x94but there was great joy.\r\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been\r\nsorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute\r\nastonishment.\xe2\x80\x94That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at\r\nhome after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk\r\nhalf a mile to another man\xe2\x80\x99s house, for the sake of being in mixed\r\ncompany till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility\r\nand the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A\r\nman who had been in motion since eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and\r\nmight now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have\r\nbeen silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been\r\nalone!\xe2\x80\x94Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own\r\nfireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again\r\ninto the world!\xe2\x80\x94Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\r\nback his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\r\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley looked\r\nat him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nnot have believed it even of _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\r\nexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\r\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\r\nmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\r\ninquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\r\nher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\r\nabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\r\ncommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\r\nhad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\r\nthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\r\nhad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it, read it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit will give you pleasure; only a few\r\nlines\xe2\x80\x94will not take you long; read it to Emma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\r\nto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible\r\nto every body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\r\nto it?\xe2\x80\x94I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?\xe2\x80\x94Anne,\r\nmy dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?\xe2\x80\x94In\r\ntown next week, you see\xe2\x80\x94at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\r\nimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\r\nlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\r\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\r\nagain, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\r\nand he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\r\nWell, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\r\nit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\r\nother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\r\ncircumstance to the others in a common way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and\r\nwords had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\r\nhappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm\r\nand open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little\r\noccupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the\r\ndegree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\r\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\r\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\r\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\r\n\r\nIt was well that he took every body\xe2\x80\x99s joy for granted, or he might not\r\nhave thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\r\ndelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\r\nbe made happy;\xe2\x80\x94from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\r\nshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\r\nbeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\r\nElton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the\r\nsubject with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Weston.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\r\nher by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\r\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\r\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very obliging.\xe2\x80\x94Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x94 He\r\nis to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\r\nletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s hand, presumed to open it\xe2\x80\x94though it was not directed to me\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nto Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\r\nhardly ever get a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x94(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.\xe2\x80\x94A most\r\ndangerous precedent indeed!\xe2\x80\x94I beg you will not let your neighbours\r\nfollow your example.\xe2\x80\x94Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\r\nmarried women must begin to exert ourselves!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\r\nnot have believed it of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\r\nElton.\xe2\x80\x94This letter tells us\xe2\x80\x94it is a short letter\xe2\x80\x94written in a hurry,\r\nmerely to give us notice\xe2\x80\x94it tells us that they are all coming up to\r\ntown directly, on Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s account\xe2\x80\x94she has not been well the\r\nwhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her\xe2\x80\x94so they are all to\r\nmove southward without loss of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x94from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\r\nconsiderable journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\r\nfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\r\nof large fortune?\xe2\x80\x94You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\r\nSuckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me\xe2\x80\x94but twice\r\nin one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\r\nhorses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evil of the distance from Enscombe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cis, that\r\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\r\nsofa for a week together. In Frank\xe2\x80\x99s last letter she complained, he\r\nsaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\r\nboth his arm and his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\r\nweakness\xe2\x80\x94but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\r\nsleep only two nights on the road.\xe2\x80\x94So Frank writes word. Certainly,\r\ndelicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\r\nmust grant me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\r\nown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice\xe2\x80\x94You will find me a formidable\r\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women\xe2\x80\x94and I assure you,\r\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\r\nwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s making incredible exertions to\r\navoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her\xe2\x80\x94and I believe I have\r\ncaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\r\nan excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\r\nlady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the\r\nland for\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\r\nyou. Do not run away with such an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\r\na fine lady as any body ever beheld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\r\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\r\n_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\r\nit;\xe2\x80\x94and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\r\nWeston went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthis is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\r\ntherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\r\nnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I\r\nwould not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith\r\nin Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s illness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?\xe2\x80\x94To Bath, or to\r\nClifton?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\r\nher. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\r\nbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\r\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\r\nretired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye\xe2\x80\x94like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\r\nthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\r\nseem shut out from every thing\xe2\x80\x94in the most complete retirement.\xe2\x80\x94And\r\nMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\r\nthat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough\r\nin herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman\r\ncannot have too many resources\xe2\x80\x94and I feel very thankful that I have so\r\nmany myself as to be quite independent of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank was here in February for a fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\r\nof Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\r\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\r\nsuch a creature in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\r\nWeston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing\r\npossible. Not heard of you!\xe2\x80\x94I believe Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s letters lately have\r\nbeen full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Frank left us,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cit was quite uncertain when we\r\nmight see him again, which makes this day\xe2\x80\x99s news doubly welcome. It has\r\nbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\r\nhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\r\ndesponding. \xe2\x80\x98How could he contrive to come? And how could it be\r\nsupposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?\xe2\x80\x99 and so forth\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nalways felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has,\r\nyou see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if\r\nthings are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say\r\nto a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,\r\nbecause things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the\r\nrapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and\r\nexclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to\r\ndispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The\r\ncarriage\xe2\x80\x94we had disappointments about the carriage;\xe2\x80\x94one morning, I\r\nremember, he came to me quite in despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\r\nseized the opportunity of going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is\r\nordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\r\nEnscombe\xe2\x80\x94in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\r\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring\xe2\x80\x94precisely the\r\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\r\nthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\r\nnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\r\nof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there\r\nalways is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\r\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\r\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\r\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\r\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\r\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\r\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\r\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\r\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\r\ngratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\r\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\r\nFrank Churchill.\xe2\x80\x94At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\r\nof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means\r\nimplicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,\r\nso I shall judge of him.\xe2\x80\x94I am no flatterer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Weston was musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said he presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\r\nChurchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\r\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me\r\nto speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be\r\nignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the\r\ntreatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of\r\nit is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s mother would\r\nnever have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has\r\npride; but his pride is nothing to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s: his is a quiet,\r\nindolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only\r\nmake himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance\r\nand insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair\r\npretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely\r\nthe daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a\r\nChurchill she has out-Churchill\xe2\x80\x99d them all in high and mighty claims:\r\nbut in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a\r\nhorror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\r\npeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\r\nare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\r\nthemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\r\ndirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\r\nencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense\r\nairs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established\r\nfamilies. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived\r\nat West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came\r\nfrom Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.\r\nWeston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is\r\nsomething direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of\r\nthe Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\r\nyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my\r\nbrother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\r\nneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\r\nyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve, at least\xe2\x80\x94I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\r\nthe purchase before his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\r\nsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\r\nWoodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\r\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\r\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\r\nnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of\r\nspirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\r\n\r\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\r\nleave them early the next day; and he soon began with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\r\nboys; but you have your sister\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and every thing is down at\r\nfull length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise\r\nthan her\xe2\x80\x99s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have\r\nto recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather hope to satisfy you both,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I shall do all in\r\nmy power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\r\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very likely. You think so, do not you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father\xe2\x80\x94or even\r\nmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue\r\nto increase as much as they have done lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncrease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\r\ngreat difference in your way of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifference! No indeed I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\r\nthan you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for\r\nonly one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!\xe2\x80\x94When did it\r\nhappen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,\r\nand you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella\r\nbrought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s, or balls\r\nat the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in\r\nyour goings-on, is very great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cit is Randalls that does it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\r\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\r\nthat Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I\r\nonly beg you to send them home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cthat need not be the consequence. Let them\r\nbe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cyou amuse me! I should like to know\r\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\r\nof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\r\nto attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nhave they been? Dining once with the Coles\xe2\x80\x94and having a ball talked of,\r\nwhich never took place. I can understand you\xe2\x80\x94(nodding at Mr. John\r\nKnightley)\xe2\x80\x94your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\r\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning\r\nto Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours\r\nfrom Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for\r\nme, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that\r\nif Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much\r\nbetter with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours\r\nwhere she is absent one\xe2\x80\x94and who, when he is at home, is either reading\r\nto himself or settling his accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\r\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to talk to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\r\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\r\nwas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\r\napprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\r\nreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\r\ntwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he\r\nhad taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\r\nmonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\r\nher:\xe2\x80\x94caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did not\r\nmean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\r\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\r\n\r\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\r\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\r\nacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\r\ndecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\r\ncrisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and\r\ntranquil state.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had\r\nforeseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank\r\nChurchill\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so\r\nsoon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.\r\nHe rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he\r\ncame from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise\r\nall her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was\r\ninfluenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost\r\nfriendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing\r\nher. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\r\nhad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. She\r\nwatched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had\r\nbeen. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had\r\nproduced this very natural and very desirable effect.\r\n\r\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\r\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and\r\nhe was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\r\nhis comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently\r\nfluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it\r\nseemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her\r\nbelief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and\r\nhurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had seen a group of\r\nold acquaintance in the street as he passed\xe2\x80\x94he had not stopped, he\r\nwould not stop for more than a word\xe2\x80\x94but he had the vanity to think they\r\nwould be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay\r\nlonger at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\xe2\x80\x9d She had no doubt as to his\r\nbeing less in love\xe2\x80\x94but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying\r\naway, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think\r\nit implied a dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of\r\nnot trusting himself with her long.\r\n\r\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\r\nHe was often hoping, intending to come\xe2\x80\x94but was always prevented. His\r\naunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\r\nRandall\xe2\x80\x99s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\r\nto be inferred that Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s removal to London had been of no\r\nservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\r\nreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,\r\nat Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he\r\nlooked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been\r\nhalf a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that\r\ncare and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have\r\nmany years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,\r\nby all his father\xe2\x80\x99s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely\r\nimaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not\r\nendure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\r\nsuffering; and by the ten days\xe2\x80\x99 end, her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Randalls\r\ncommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\r\nRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\r\nan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\r\nready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\r\nexpected from the change.\r\n\r\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\r\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\r\nbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nhouse was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\r\nthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\r\ncould even wish.\r\n\r\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\r\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\r\nhoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It\r\nwas the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\r\nreally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a\r\nyoung man?\xe2\x80\x94An hour\xe2\x80\x99s ride. He would be always coming over. The\r\ndifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\r\nthe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\r\nmiles\xe2\x80\x94nay, eighteen\xe2\x80\x94it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street\xe2\x80\x94was a\r\nserious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent\r\nin coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London;\r\nhe might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for\r\neasy intercourse. Better than nearer!\r\n\r\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\r\nremoval,\xe2\x80\x94the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but\r\nit had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\r\nhowever, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\r\nvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines\r\nfrom Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the\r\nchange, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for\r\ntwenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a\r\nday as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\r\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\r\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\r\nspend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\r\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have\r\nany thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\r\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\r\nChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\r\nbefore dinner, and every thing was safe.\r\n\r\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at\r\nthe Crown was to witness it;\xe2\x80\x94but it would be better than a common\r\nmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\r\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\r\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort\r\nof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse\r\nhim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good\r\ntime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\r\n\r\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\r\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\r\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it\r\nshould be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of\r\nanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,\r\nwithout great surprize. \xe2\x80\x9cSo unreasonably early!\xe2\x80\x9d she was going to\r\nexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,\r\nwho were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another\r\ncarriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same\r\ndistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if\r\nhalf the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of\r\npreparatory inspection.\r\n\r\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.\r\nWeston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a\r\nman who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\r\ndistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a\r\nlittle less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x94General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man\r\nwhat he ought to be.\xe2\x80\x94She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked\r\nabout, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to\r\ndo, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\r\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a\r\nfire in the evening was still very pleasant.\r\n\r\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s fault that the number of privy\r\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s door\r\nto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\r\nbrought by the Eltons.\r\n\r\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\r\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\r\nthe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,\xe2\x80\x94impatient\r\nto begin, or afraid of being always near her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton was spoken of. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she must be here soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\r\nIt cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\r\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Weston, looking about. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nthought you were to bring them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\r\nlonged to know what Frank\xe2\x80\x99s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\r\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\r\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\r\nby giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.\xe2\x80\x94Somebody talked of rain.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank to his father:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bates must not be forgotten:\xe2\x80\x9d and away he went. Mr. Weston was\r\nfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\r\nof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\r\nthough by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\r\nI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\r\npleased with him.\xe2\x80\x94You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a\r\nvery handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\r\napprove\xe2\x80\x94so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\r\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies\xe2\x80\x94quite a horror of them.\r\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me\r\nhad ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\r\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\r\nmuch better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s attention was chained; but\r\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\r\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of its being our\r\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\r\nextremely expeditious!\xe2\x80\x94I believe we drive faster than any body.\xe2\x80\x94What a\r\npleasure it is to send one\xe2\x80\x99s carriage for a friend!\xe2\x80\x94I understand you\r\nwere so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite\r\nunnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\r\nthe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be\r\nunderstood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every\r\nbody\xe2\x80\x99s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,\r\nwho came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes\r\nafter her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door\r\nopened she was heard,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo very obliging of you!\xe2\x80\x94No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\r\ncare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares\xe2\x80\x94Well!\xe2\x80\x94(as soon as\r\nshe was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!\xe2\x80\x94This is\r\nadmirable!\xe2\x80\x94Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\r\nnot have imagined it.\xe2\x80\x94So well lighted up!\xe2\x80\x94Jane, Jane, look!\xe2\x80\x94did you\r\never see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\r\nI came in; she was standing in the entrance. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! Mrs. Stokes,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94but I had not time for more.\xe2\x80\x9d She was now met by Mrs. Weston.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nwell, I thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\r\nit. So afraid you might have a headache!\xe2\x80\x94seeing you pass by so often,\r\nand knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it\r\nindeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the\r\ncarriage!\xe2\x80\x94excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the\r\nhorses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! and I am sure our\r\nthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most\r\nkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.\xe2\x80\x94But two such offers in\r\none day!\xe2\x80\x94Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, \xe2\x80\x98Upon my\r\nword, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x99 Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s. I made her take her shawl\xe2\x80\x94for the evenings are not\r\nwarm\xe2\x80\x94her large new shawl\xe2\x80\x94 Mrs. Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-present.\xe2\x80\x94So kind of her\r\nto think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s choice.\r\nThere were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some\r\ntime. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you\r\nsure you did not wet your feet?\xe2\x80\x94It was but a drop or two, but I am so\r\nafraid:\xe2\x80\x94but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely\xe2\x80\x94and there was a mat to\r\nstep upon\xe2\x80\x94I shall never forget his extreme politeness.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! Mr. Frank\r\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother\xe2\x80\x99s spectacles have never been in\r\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\r\nyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?\xe2\x80\x94Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\r\nChurchill?\xe2\x80\x94Ah! here\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Woodhouse.\xe2\x80\x94Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x94Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in\r\nfairy-land!\xe2\x80\x94Such a transformation!\xe2\x80\x94Must not compliment, I know (eyeing\r\nEmma most complacently)\xe2\x80\x94that would be rude\xe2\x80\x94but upon my word, Miss\r\nWoodhouse, you do look\xe2\x80\x94how do you like Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hair?\xe2\x80\x94You are a\r\njudge.\xe2\x80\x94She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\r\nhair!\xe2\x80\x94No hairdresser from London I think could.\xe2\x80\x94Ah! Dr. Hughes I\r\ndeclare\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x94How do you do? How do you do?\xe2\x80\x94Very well, I thank you. This is\r\ndelightful, is not it?\xe2\x80\x94Where\xe2\x80\x99s dear Mr. Richard?\xe2\x80\x94Oh! there he is. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do\r\nyou do, Mr. Richard?\xe2\x80\x94I saw you the other day as you rode through the\r\ntown\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Otway, I protest!\xe2\x80\x94and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss\r\nCaroline.\xe2\x80\x94Such a host of friends!\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!\xe2\x80\x94How do\r\nyou do? How do you all do?\xe2\x80\x94Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t I hear another carriage?\xe2\x80\x94Who can this be?\xe2\x80\x94very likely the\r\nworthy Coles.\xe2\x80\x94Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among\r\nsuch friends! And such a noble fire!\xe2\x80\x94I am quite roasted. No coffee, I\r\nthank you, for me\xe2\x80\x94never take coffee.\xe2\x80\x94A little tea if you please, sir,\r\nby and bye,\xe2\x80\x94no hurry\xe2\x80\x94Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\r\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\r\ndiscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little\r\nway behind her.\xe2\x80\x94He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she\r\ncould not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress\r\nand look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was\r\nevidently wanting to be complimented herself\xe2\x80\x94and it was, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\nlike my gown?\xe2\x80\x94How do you like my trimming?\xe2\x80\x94How has Wright done my\r\nhair?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\r\npoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, \xe2\x80\x9cNobody can think less of dress in\r\ngeneral than I do\xe2\x80\x94but upon such an occasion as this, when every body\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons\xe2\x80\x94who I have\r\nno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour\xe2\x80\x94I would not wish\r\nto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x94So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.\xe2\x80\x94We shall\r\nsee if our styles suit.\xe2\x80\x94A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\r\nI like him very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\r\nbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\r\nmore;\xe2\x80\x94and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\r\nanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s tones again distinctly\r\nforward.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\r\ntidings of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\r\ndispleasure.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat is easy\xe2\x80\x94but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you like Mrs. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ungrateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful!\xe2\x80\x94What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Then changing from a frown to a\r\nsmile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, do not tell me\xe2\x80\x94I do not want to know what you mean.\xe2\x80\x94Where is\r\nmy father?\xe2\x80\x94When are we to begin dancing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\r\noff to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\r\nMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\r\nlaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\r\nmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\r\ninterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.\xe2\x80\x94Emma\r\nheard the sad truth with fortitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Weston.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will think Frank ought to ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\r\nboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\r\nperfect approbation of\xe2\x80\x94and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\r\nwanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\r\nwas to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nWeston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\r\nWoodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\r\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was\r\nalmost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly\r\nthe advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though\r\nshe had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by\r\nthe change. Mr. Weston might be his son\xe2\x80\x99s superior.\xe2\x80\x94In spite of this\r\nlittle rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see\r\nthe respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that\r\nshe had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.\xe2\x80\x94She was more\r\ndisturbed by Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s not dancing than by any thing else.\xe2\x80\x94There\r\nhe was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be\r\ndancing,\xe2\x80\x94not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and\r\nwhist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance\r\ntill their rubbers were made up,\xe2\x80\x94so young as he looked!\xe2\x80\x94He could not\r\nhave appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had\r\nplaced himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms\r\nand stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must\r\ndraw every body\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not\r\none among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.\xe2\x80\x94He\r\nmoved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in\r\nhow gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have\r\ndanced, would he but take the trouble.\xe2\x80\x94Whenever she caught his eye, she\r\nforced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he\r\ncould love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.\xe2\x80\x94He\r\nseemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he\r\nthought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she\r\ndid not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and\r\nher partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.\r\nThat Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was\r\nindubitable.\r\n\r\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\r\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\r\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\r\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\r\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\r\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings\r\nusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x94The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\r\npartner;\xe2\x80\x94the only young lady sitting down;\xe2\x80\x94and so equal had been\r\nhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one\r\ndisengaged was the wonder!\xe2\x80\x94But Emma\xe2\x80\x99s wonder lessened soon afterwards,\r\non seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance\r\nif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nwas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.\r\n\r\nEscape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room\r\nwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in\r\nfront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of\r\nmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss\r\nSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.\xe2\x80\x94Emma saw it. She was\r\nnot yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had\r\ntherefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little\r\nshe saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were\r\nexactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;\r\nbut Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue\r\nwhich just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she\r\nperceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was\r\nnot only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant\r\nglances.\xe2\x80\x94The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join\r\nhim and say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo not you dance, Mr. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d to which his prompt reply\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x9cMost readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x94oh! no\xe2\x80\x94I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\r\ndancer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have great\r\npleasure, I am sure\xe2\x80\x94for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\r\nmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\r\ngreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\r\nGilbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\r\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing\xe2\x80\x94Miss Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nSmith!\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x94I had not observed.\xe2\x80\x94You are extremely obliging\xe2\x80\x94and if I were\r\nnot an old married man.\xe2\x80\x94But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You\r\nwill excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\r\ncommand\xe2\x80\x94but my dancing days are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\r\nmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton!\r\nthe amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.\xe2\x80\x94She looked round for a moment;\r\nhe had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging\r\nhimself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed\r\nbetween him and his wife.\r\n\r\nShe would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\r\nface might be as hot.\r\n\r\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley leading\r\nHarriet to the set!\xe2\x80\x94Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\r\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\r\nboth for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\r\ntoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\r\ncatch his eye again.\r\n\r\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\r\nand Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\r\nthe cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\r\nand very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\r\nannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\r\nflew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\r\n\r\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\r\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\r\ngrowing very like her;\xe2\x80\x94_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\r\naudibly to her partner,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!\xe2\x80\x94Very good-natured,\r\nI declare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSupper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard\r\nfrom that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table\r\nand taking up her spoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?\xe2\x80\x94Here is your tippet. Mrs.\r\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there\r\nwill be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done\xe2\x80\x94One\r\ndoor nailed up\xe2\x80\x94Quantities of matting\xe2\x80\x94My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr.\r\nChurchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!\xe2\x80\x94so\r\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!\xe2\x80\x94Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\r\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody\r\nmissed me.\xe2\x80\x94I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\r\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\r\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.\xe2\x80\x94Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\r\nand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of\r\nher throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\r\namused, and who were your partners. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I shall not\r\nforestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love\r\nto tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.\r\nElton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMy dear sir, you are too obliging.\xe2\x80\x94Is there nobody you would not\r\nrather?\xe2\x80\x94I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane\r\non one arm, and me on the other!\xe2\x80\x94Stop, stop, let us stand a little\r\nback, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she\r\nlooks!\xe2\x80\x94Beautiful lace!\xe2\x80\x94Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen\r\nof the evening!\xe2\x80\x94Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take\r\ncare of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded\r\nthere were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there\r\nis but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and\r\nstyle\xe2\x80\x94Candles everywhere.\xe2\x80\x94I was telling you of your grandmama,\r\nJane,\xe2\x80\x94There was a little disappointment.\xe2\x80\x94The baked apples and biscuits,\r\nexcellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of\r\nsweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.\r\nWoodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all\r\nout again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread\r\nand asparagus\xe2\x80\x94so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would\r\nnot speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss\r\nWoodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!\xe2\x80\x94Well, this is\r\nbrilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!\xe2\x80\x94Such\r\nelegance and profusion!\xe2\x80\x94I have seen nothing like it since\xe2\x80\x94Well, where\r\nshall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a\r\ndraught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this\r\nside?\xe2\x80\x94Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill\xe2\x80\x94only it seems too good\xe2\x80\x94but just as\r\nyou please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane,\r\nhow shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too!\r\nBless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent,\r\nand I cannot help beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\r\nbut, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him\r\nirresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\r\nreprobation of Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\r\nand Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s looks also received the due share of censure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cEmma, why is it\r\nthat they are your enemies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x94To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\r\nthat you did want him to marry Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cand they cannot forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\r\nonly said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you trust me with such flatterers?\xe2\x80\x94Does my vain spirit ever tell\r\nme I am wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.\xe2\x80\x94If one leads you wrong,\r\nI am sure the other tells you of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There\r\nis a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not:\r\nand I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was\r\nthrough a series of strange blunders!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\r\njustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\r\nchosen for himself.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\r\nMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\r\nwoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was extremely gratified.\xe2\x80\x94They were interrupted by the bustle of\r\nMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\r\ndoing?\xe2\x80\x94Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\r\nEvery body is asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever I am wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom are you going to dance with?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Knightley.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWith you, if you will ask\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, offering his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\r\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother and sister! no, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\r\npleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\r\nshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.\xe2\x80\x94She was extremely\r\nglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\r\nEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\r\nalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\r\npeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\r\nminutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\r\noccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\r\nto another happy result\xe2\x80\x94the cure of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation.\xe2\x80\x94From\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted\r\nthe ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were\r\nsuddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the\r\nsuperior creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma\r\ncould harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by\r\ninjurious courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\r\nsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\r\nrequisite.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\r\nMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\r\nmust be before her!\r\n\r\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that\r\nhe could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he\r\nwas to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them\r\nall to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened\r\nup for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their\r\ngrandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons\r\nentered whom she had never less expected to see together\xe2\x80\x94Frank\r\nChurchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm\xe2\x80\x94actually Harriet!\xe2\x80\x94A moment\r\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\r\nHarriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x94The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards\r\nasunder;\xe2\x80\x94they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately\r\nsinking into a chair fainted away.\r\n\r\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\r\nand surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\r\nsuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\r\nwith the whole.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\r\nGoddard\xe2\x80\x99s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\r\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\r\nfor safety, had led them into alarm.\xe2\x80\x94About half a mile beyond Highbury,\r\nmaking a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\r\nfor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had\r\nadvanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\r\ndistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\r\nparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\r\nMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and\r\ncalling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight\r\nhedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to\r\nHighbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much\r\nfrom cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\r\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nthis state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\r\n\r\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\r\ncourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\r\nnot be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen\r\nchildren, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and\r\nimpertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.\xe2\x80\x94More and more\r\nfrightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her\r\npurse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to\r\nuse her ill.\xe2\x80\x94She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was\r\nmoving away\xe2\x80\x94but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was\r\nfollowed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\r\n\r\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\r\nconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\r\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\r\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\r\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\r\na mile or two beyond Highbury\xe2\x80\x94and happening to have borrowed a pair of\r\nscissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\r\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\r\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on\r\nfoot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\r\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\r\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\r\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\r\nenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It\r\nwas his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis was the amount of the whole story,\xe2\x80\x94of his communication and of\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.\xe2\x80\x94He dared\r\nnot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not\r\nanother minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\r\nsafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\r\nin the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the\r\ngrateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\r\n\r\nSuch an adventure as this,\xe2\x80\x94a fine young man and a lovely young woman\r\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\r\nideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\r\nleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\r\nhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\r\nheard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\r\nat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?\xe2\x80\x94How much\r\nmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\r\nforesight!\xe2\x80\x94especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\r\nmind had already made.\r\n\r\nIt was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\r\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\r\nrencontre, no alarm of the kind;\xe2\x80\x94and now it had happened to the very\r\nperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\r\nto pass by to rescue her!\xe2\x80\x94It certainly was very extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x94And\r\nknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\r\nperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\r\nattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr.\r\nElton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most\r\ninteresting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence\r\nshould not be strongly recommending each to the other.\r\n\r\nIn the few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation which she had yet had with him, while\r\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her\r\nna\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\r\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\naccount had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\r\nabominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing\r\nwas to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\r\nShe would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\r\ninterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive\r\nscheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\r\nwhat had passed,\xe2\x80\x94aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\r\nshe soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\r\nit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\r\nwho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\r\nthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as\r\nhe sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without\r\ntheir promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some\r\ncomfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse\r\n(for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well\r\nas Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\r\nthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\r\nindifferent\xe2\x80\x94which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\r\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\r\nan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for\r\nshe hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\r\nillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\r\n\r\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\r\nthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\r\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\r\ndwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\r\nnephews:\xe2\x80\x94in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\r\nJohn were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\r\ngipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\r\nslightest particular from the original recital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\r\nmorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\r\nand hesitating, thus began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94if you are at leisure\xe2\x80\x94I have something that I should\r\nlike to tell you\xe2\x80\x94a sort of confession to make\xe2\x80\x94and then, you know, it\r\nwill be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\r\nseriousness in Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s manner which prepared her, quite as much as\r\nher words, for something more than ordinary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cto have\r\nno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\r\ncreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\r\nnecessary\xe2\x80\x94I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\r\nI dare say you understand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I could so long a time be fancying myself!...\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet,\r\nwarmly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\r\nin him now.\xe2\x80\x94I do not care whether I meet him or not\xe2\x80\x94except that of the\r\ntwo I had rather not see him\xe2\x80\x94and indeed I would go any distance round\r\nto avoid him\xe2\x80\x94but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\r\nher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\r\nall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable\xe2\x80\x94I shall\r\nnever forget her look the other night!\xe2\x80\x94However, I assure you, Miss\r\nWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.\xe2\x80\x94No, let them be ever so happy together,\r\nit will not give me another moment\xe2\x80\x99s pang: and to convince you that I\r\nhave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy\xe2\x80\x94what I ought to\r\nhave destroyed long ago\xe2\x80\x94what I ought never to have kept\xe2\x80\x94I know that\r\nvery well (blushing as she spoke).\xe2\x80\x94However, now I will destroy it\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\r\nmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\r\nholds?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a conscious look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least in the world.\xe2\x80\x94Did he ever give you any thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\r\nvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\r\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\r\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\r\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which\r\nHarriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\r\nexcepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _must_ recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed I do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\r\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\r\ntimes we ever met in it!\xe2\x80\x94It was but a very few days before I had my\r\nsore throat\xe2\x80\x94just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came\xe2\x80\x94I think the\r\nvery evening.\xe2\x80\x94Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\r\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?\xe2\x80\x94But, as you had none\r\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\r\nmine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\r\ncut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before\r\nhe gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help\r\nmaking a treasure of it\xe2\x80\x94so I put it by never to be used, and looked at\r\nit now and then as a great treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Harriet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and\r\njumping up, \xe2\x80\x9cyou make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\r\nRemember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\r\nrelic\xe2\x80\x94I knew nothing of that till this moment\xe2\x80\x94but the cutting the\r\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! my sins, my sins!\xe2\x80\x94And I had plenty all the while in my\r\npocket!\xe2\x80\x94One of my senseless tricks!\xe2\x80\x94I deserve to be under a continual\r\nblush all the rest of my life.\xe2\x80\x94Well\xe2\x80\x94(sitting down again)\xe2\x80\x94go on\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\r\nit, you did it so naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\r\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cLord\r\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\r\npiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\r\nnever was equal to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \xe2\x80\x9chere is something\r\nstill more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\r\nthis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\r\nnever did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of\r\nan old pencil,\xe2\x80\x94the part without any lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was really his,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harriet.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo not you remember one\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x94no, I dare say you do not. But one morning\xe2\x80\x94I forget exactly\r\nthe day\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\r\n_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\r\nabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\r\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\r\nhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\r\nit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\r\ntable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\r\ndared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do remember it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cI perfectly remember it.\xe2\x80\x94Talking about\r\nspruce-beer.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! yes\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and\r\nMr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly\r\nremember it.\xe2\x80\x94Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I\r\nhave an idea he was standing just here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I do not know. I cannot recollect.\xe2\x80\x94It is very odd, but I cannot\r\nrecollect.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\r\nam now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say\xe2\x80\x94except that\r\nI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to\r\nsee me do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\r\ntreasuring up these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, simpleton as I was!\xe2\x80\x94but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\r\ncould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\r\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhad not resolution enough to part with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?\xe2\x80\x94I have not a\r\nword to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\r\nuseful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be happier to burn it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harriet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has a\r\ndisagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.\xe2\x80\x94There it goes,\r\nand there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cwill there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\r\nalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\r\n_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x94About a\r\nfortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and\r\nquite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which\r\nmade the information she received more valuable. She merely said, in\r\nthe course of some trivial chat, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Harriet, whenever you marry I\r\nwould advise you to do so and so\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thought no more of it, till after\r\na minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall never marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not,\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever marry!\xe2\x80\x94This is a new resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one that I shall never change, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter another short hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it does not proceed from\xe2\x80\x94I hope\r\nit is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Elton indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet indignantly.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Emma could\r\njust catch the words, \xe2\x80\x9cso superior to Mr. Elton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\r\nfarther?\xe2\x80\x94should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?\xe2\x80\x94Perhaps\r\nHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she\r\nwere totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to\r\nhear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had\r\nbeen, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she\r\nwas perfectly resolved.\xe2\x80\x94She believed it would be wiser for her to say\r\nand know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was\r\nalways best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,\r\non any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have\r\nthe judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.\xe2\x80\x94She was\r\ndecided, and thus spoke\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\r\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\r\nan idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly\r\nyour superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose\xe2\x80\x94\r\nIndeed I am not so mad.\xe2\x80\x94But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\r\ndistance\xe2\x80\x94and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\r\nthe world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\r\nproper, in me especially.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\r\nwas enough to warm your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cService! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!\xe2\x80\x94The very\r\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time\xe2\x80\x94when I saw him\r\ncoming\xe2\x80\x94his noble look\xe2\x80\x94and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one\r\nmoment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.\xe2\x80\x94Yes,\r\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.\xe2\x80\x94But that it\r\nwill be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\r\nadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for\r\nits being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\r\nwisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\r\nlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\r\nobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\r\ngive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\r\nthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\r\nknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were\r\nvery wrong before; we will be cautious now.\xe2\x80\x94He is your superior, no\r\ndoubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious\r\nnature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there\r\nhave been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I\r\nwould not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured\r\nyour raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I\r\nshall always know how to value.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\r\nvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her\r\nfriend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind\xe2\x80\x94and it must\r\nbe saving her from the danger of degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\r\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\r\nEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\r\nto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was\r\nagain delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was\r\nlikely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she\r\nwere able to defeat Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s activity in her service, and save\r\nherself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had\r\ncertainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing\r\nto dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in\r\nhis pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\r\nEvery thing declared it; his own attentions, his father\xe2\x80\x99s hints, his\r\nmother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,\r\ndiscretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many\r\nwere devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,\r\nMr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with\r\nJane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of\r\nintelligence between them\xe2\x80\x94he thought so at least\xe2\x80\x94symptoms of admiration\r\non his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself\r\nto think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any\r\nof Emma\xe2\x80\x99s errors of imagination. _She_ was not present when the\r\nsuspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and\r\nJane, at the Eltons\xe2\x80\x99; and he had seen a look, more than a single look,\r\nat Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed\r\nsomewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not\r\nhelp remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations\r\nwhich, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMyself creating what I saw,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of\r\nprivate liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill\r\nand Jane.\r\n\r\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\r\nhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he\r\njoined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,\r\nlike themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\r\nweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\r\nand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\r\nreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\r\nvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\r\nand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;\r\nand after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons\r\nlistened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmost obliging invitation.\r\n\r\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on\r\nhorseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nbecame of Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s plan of setting up his carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know that he ever\r\nhad any such plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was\r\ncertainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\r\nextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\r\nthought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\r\nmust remember it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! really, never!\xe2\x80\x94Bless me! how could it be?\xe2\x80\x94Then I must have\r\ndreamt it\xe2\x80\x94but I was completely persuaded\xe2\x80\x94Miss Smith, you walk as if you\r\nwere tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x94What is this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cabout Perry and a\r\ncarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he\r\ncan afford it. You had it from himself, had you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his son, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI seem to have had it from\r\nnobody.\xe2\x80\x94Very odd!\xe2\x80\x94I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s having\r\nmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with\r\nall these particulars\xe2\x80\x94but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\r\nit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I\r\ndream of every body at Highbury when I am away\xe2\x80\x94and when I have gone\r\nthrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPerry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is odd though,\xe2\x80\x9d observed his father, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should have had such\r\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\r\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s setting up his carriage! and\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s persuading him to it, out of care for his health\xe2\x80\x94just what\r\nwill happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\r\npremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\r\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your\r\ndream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are\r\nabsent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\r\nprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of\r\nMr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s hint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to own the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\r\nto be heard the last two minutes, \xe2\x80\x9cif I must speak on this subject,\r\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have\xe2\x80\x94I do not mean\r\nto say that he did not dream it\xe2\x80\x94I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\r\ndreams in the world\xe2\x80\x94but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\r\nthat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\r\nmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\r\nourselves\xe2\x80\x94but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\r\nthought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\r\nhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\r\nbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember\r\ngrandmama\xe2\x80\x99s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had\r\nbeen walking to\xe2\x80\x94very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\r\nRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother\xe2\x80\x94indeed I\r\ndo not know who is not\xe2\x80\x94and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\r\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\r\nbeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\r\nI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\r\nnever dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing\r\nbefore I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and\r\nnow and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not\r\nlike Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the\r\nleast thing in the world. Where is she?\xe2\x80\x94Oh! just behind. Perfectly\r\nremember Mrs. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x94Extraordinary dream, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had preceded Miss\r\nBates\xe2\x80\x99s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s face, where he\r\nthought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\r\ninvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\r\nwith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen\r\nwaited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\r\nChurchill the determination of catching her eye\xe2\x80\x94he seemed watching her\r\nintently\xe2\x80\x94in vain, however, if it were so\xe2\x80\x94Jane passed between them into\r\nthe hall, and looked at neither.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\r\nborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\r\nthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\r\nand which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\r\npersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on\r\nwhich two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea\r\npassed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\r\nhim, which he could reach as he sat, \xe2\x80\x9chave your nephews taken away\r\ntheir alphabets\xe2\x80\x94their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is\r\nit? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated\r\nrather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters\r\none morning. I want to puzzle you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was\r\nquickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\r\ndisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\r\nfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The\r\nquietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,\r\nwho had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.\r\nWeston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in\r\nlamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\r\nlittle boys,\xe2\x80\x9d or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter\r\nnear him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\r\n\r\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\r\nglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\r\nEmma, Jane opposite to them\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\r\nall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\r\napparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\r\npushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\r\nburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\r\nlooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\r\nevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell\r\nto work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\r\nThe word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there\r\nwas a blush on Jane\xe2\x80\x99s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise\r\nostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could\r\nall be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion\r\nof his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must\r\nbe some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed\r\nto meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for\r\ngallantry and trick. It was a child\xe2\x80\x99s play, chosen to conceal a deeper\r\ngame on Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\r\nand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a\r\nshort word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and\r\ndemure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly\r\nentertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to\r\nappear to censure; for she said, \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! for shame!\xe2\x80\x9d He heard Frank\r\nChurchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give it to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing\r\nwarmth. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\r\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\r\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\r\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s excessive curiosity\r\nto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\r\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to\r\nbe _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s perception seemed to accompany his; her\r\ncomprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the\r\nsuperior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\r\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\r\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not\r\nknow that proper names were allowed,\xe2\x80\x9d pushed away the letters with even\r\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\r\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\r\nattack, and turned towards her aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, very true, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\r\na word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\r\ngoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\r\nfor us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x99s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\r\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;\r\nbut so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.\r\nKnightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed\r\ntowards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was\r\nafterwards looking for her shawl\xe2\x80\x94Frank Churchill was looking also\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,\r\nMr. Knightley could not tell.\r\n\r\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what\r\nhe had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\r\nobservations, he must\xe2\x80\x94yes, he certainly must, as a friend\xe2\x80\x94an anxious\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\r\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\r\npoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw\r\nthe word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining\r\nto the one, and so very distressing to the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\r\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she\r\nwas really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in evident embarrassment, \xe2\x80\x9cit all meant nothing; a mere\r\njoke among ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe joke,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cseemed confined to you and Mr.\r\nChurchill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\r\nbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\r\ndoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference\xe2\x80\x94fruitless\r\ninterference. Emma\xe2\x80\x99s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed\r\nto declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to\r\nher, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome\r\ninterference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather\r\nthan the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at last, with earnest kindness, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think\r\nyou perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\r\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.\xe2\x80\x94Why\r\ndo you make a doubt of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\r\nthat she admired him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with a most open eagerness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNever, for the\r\ntwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\r\nit possibly come into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\r\npublic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\r\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander\xe2\x80\x94but it will not do\xe2\x80\x94very sorry\r\nto check you in your first essay\xe2\x80\x94but indeed it will not do. There is no\r\nadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\r\nhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances\xe2\x80\x94feelings\r\nrather of a totally different nature\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible exactly to\r\nexplain:\xe2\x80\x94there is a good deal of nonsense in it\xe2\x80\x94but the part which is\r\ncapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\r\nfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\r\nthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\r\ncan _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which\r\nsilenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\r\nprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\r\nsuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\r\ncircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\r\nhers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\r\nirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\r\nfever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s tender habits required almost\r\nevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\r\nleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSuckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\r\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\r\nimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\r\npresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again\r\nrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncoming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\r\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the\r\nsituation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might\r\neventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of\r\nall her neighbours was by the approach of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\r\nof pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\r\nwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\r\nat first;\xe2\x80\x94but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\r\nneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the\r\nSucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\r\nautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\r\nto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\r\nidea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see\r\nwhat every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had\r\nagreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more\r\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be\r\ndone in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the\r\nbustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic\r\nparade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.\r\n\r\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\r\nfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.\r\nWeston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and\r\nsister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go\r\ntogether; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it\r\nwas to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing\r\nbut her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must\r\nalready be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ncould not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain\r\nto his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an\r\narrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an\r\narrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of\r\nbeing said to be of Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s party! Every feeling was offended; and\r\nthe forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of\r\nsecret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you approve of what I have done,\xe2\x80\x9d said he very comfortably.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\r\nnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\r\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\r\nleave her out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was\r\ngrowing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\r\npigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\r\ninto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\r\nbefore the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\r\non, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s resources were\r\ninadequate to such an attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not this most vexatious, Knightley?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd such weather\r\nfor exploring!\xe2\x80\x94These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\r\nare we to do?\xe2\x80\x94The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.\r\nBefore this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\r\nexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better explore to Donwell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Knightley. \xe2\x80\x9cThat may\r\nbe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are\r\nripening fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\r\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I should like\r\nit of all things,\xe2\x80\x9d was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\r\nfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\r\nbut no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\r\nthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\r\nand again to come\xe2\x80\x94much oftener than he doubted\xe2\x80\x94and was extremely\r\ngratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\r\nas she chose to consider it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may depend upon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly will come. Name your\r\nday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot name a day,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I have spoken to some others whom\r\nI would wish to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.\xe2\x80\x94I am Lady\r\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will bring Elton,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will not trouble you to\r\ngive any other invitations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! now you are looking very sly. But consider\xe2\x80\x94you need not be afraid\r\nof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\r\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party.\r\nLeave it all to me. I will invite your guests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he calmly replied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere is but one married woman in the world\r\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\r\nthat one is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Knightley;\xe2\x80\x94and till she is in being, I will manage such\r\nmatters myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are an odd creature!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, satisfied to have no one\r\npreferred to herself.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a humourist, and may say what you like.\r\nQuite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me\xe2\x80\x94Jane and her\r\naunt.\xe2\x80\x94The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\r\nthe Hartfield family. Don\xe2\x80\x99t scruple. I know you are attached to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on\r\nMiss Bates in my way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:\xe2\x80\x94but as you like. It is\r\nto be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\r\nshall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\r\non my arm. Here,\xe2\x80\x94probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\r\nmore simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\r\nno form or parade\xe2\x80\x94a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your\r\ngardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\r\ntrees;\xe2\x80\x94and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\r\nof doors\xe2\x80\x94a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\r\nand simple as possible. Is not that your idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the\r\ntable spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\r\ngentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\r\nbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\r\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94as you please; only don\xe2\x80\x99t have a great set out. And, by the bye,\r\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?\xe2\x80\x94Pray be\r\nsincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to\r\ninspect anything\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\r\nclever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\r\nwould spurn any body\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\r\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me\xe2\x80\x94and my caro sposo walking by. I\r\nreally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I\r\nconceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so\r\nmany resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\r\nhome;\xe2\x80\x94and very long walks, you know\xe2\x80\x94in summer there is dust, and in\r\nwinter there is dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane\r\nis never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however,\r\nif you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s. I would wish every thing\r\nto be as much to your taste as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\r\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\r\nwarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.\xe2\x80\x94Yes,\r\nbelieve me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\r\nthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\r\nwished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\r\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat\r\nwould inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\r\nspecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\r\nDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.\r\n\r\nHe was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him\r\nfor his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for\r\ntwo years. \xe2\x80\x9cSome very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\r\nvery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear\r\ngirls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp\r\nnow, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house\r\nagain exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,\r\nand any other of his neighbours.\xe2\x80\x94He could not see any objection at all\r\nto his, and Emma\xe2\x80\x99s, and Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s going there some very fine morning.\r\nHe thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them\xe2\x80\x94very kind\r\nand sensible\xe2\x80\x94much cleverer than dining out.\xe2\x80\x94He was not fond of dining\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\xe2\x80\x99s most ready concurrence. The\r\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\r\nMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\r\nto themselves.\xe2\x80\x94Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\r\npleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over\r\nto join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which\r\ncould have been dispensed with.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say\r\nthat he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no\r\ntime in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\r\nBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\r\nsettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,\xe2\x80\x94the weather appearing\r\nexactly right.\r\n\r\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\r\nsafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\r\nthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\r\nAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\r\nhappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\r\nhad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\r\nto heat themselves.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\r\npurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all\r\nthe others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\r\nsympathiser.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\r\nwas satisfied of her father\xe2\x80\x99s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and\r\nlook around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more\r\nparticular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds\r\nwhich must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\r\n\r\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\r\nthe present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\r\nthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\r\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered\xe2\x80\x94its ample gardens\r\nstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\r\nall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight\xe2\x80\x94and its abundance\r\nof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\r\nhad rooted up.\xe2\x80\x94The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\r\nit, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\r\ncomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.\xe2\x80\x94It was just what it ought\r\nto be, and it looked what it was\xe2\x80\x94and Emma felt an increasing respect\r\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\r\nin blood and understanding.\xe2\x80\x94Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\r\nbut Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\r\nneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These\r\nwere pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\r\nwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\r\nstrawberry-beds.\xe2\x80\x94The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\r\nChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\r\nin all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was\r\nvery ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\r\ntalking\xe2\x80\x94strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\r\nspoken of.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe best fruit in England\xe2\x80\x94every body\xe2\x80\x99s favourite\xe2\x80\x94always\r\nwholesome.\xe2\x80\x94These the finest beds and finest sorts.\xe2\x80\x94Delightful to gather\r\nfor one\xe2\x80\x99s self\xe2\x80\x94the only way of really enjoying them.\xe2\x80\x94Morning decidedly\r\nthe best time\xe2\x80\x94never tired\xe2\x80\x94every sort good\xe2\x80\x94hautboy infinitely\r\nsuperior\xe2\x80\x94no comparison\xe2\x80\x94the others hardly eatable\xe2\x80\x94hautboys very\r\nscarce\xe2\x80\x94Chili preferred\xe2\x80\x94white wood finest flavour of all\xe2\x80\x94price of\r\nstrawberries in London\xe2\x80\x94abundance about Bristol\xe2\x80\x94Maple\r\nGrove\xe2\x80\x94cultivation\xe2\x80\x94beds when to be renewed\xe2\x80\x94gardeners thinking exactly\r\ndifferent\xe2\x80\x94no general rule\xe2\x80\x94gardeners never to be put out of their\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94delicious fruit\xe2\x80\x94only too rich to be eaten much of\xe2\x80\x94inferior to\r\ncherries\xe2\x80\x94currants more refreshing\xe2\x80\x94only objection to gathering\r\nstrawberries the stooping\xe2\x80\x94glaring sun\xe2\x80\x94tired to death\xe2\x80\x94could bear it no\r\nlonger\xe2\x80\x94must go and sit in the shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation\xe2\x80\x94interrupted only once by\r\nMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\r\ninquire if he were come\xe2\x80\x94and she was a little uneasy.\xe2\x80\x94She had some fears\r\nof his horse.\r\n\r\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to\r\noverhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.\xe2\x80\x94A situation,\r\na most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received\r\nnotice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs.\r\nSuckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it\r\nfell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an\r\nacquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful,\r\ncharming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x94On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\npositively refused to take her friend\xe2\x80\x99s negative, though Miss Fairfax\r\ncontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\r\nthing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x94Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\r\nacquiescence by the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s post.\xe2\x80\x94How Jane could bear it at all, was\r\nastonishing to Emma.\xe2\x80\x94She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly\xe2\x80\x94and at\r\nlast, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\r\nremoval.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShould not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\r\ngardens\xe2\x80\x94all the gardens?\xe2\x80\x94She wished to see the whole extent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The\r\npertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\r\n\r\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a\r\nscattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\r\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of\r\nlimes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the\r\nriver, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.\xe2\x80\x94It led to nothing;\r\nnothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,\r\nwhich seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an\r\napproach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,\r\nas might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a\r\ncharming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nconsiderable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,\r\ngradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a\r\nmile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well\r\nclothed with wood;\xe2\x80\x94and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed\r\nand sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the\r\nriver making a close and handsome curve around it.\r\n\r\nIt was a sweet view\xe2\x80\x94sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\r\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without\r\nbeing oppressive.\r\n\r\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\r\ntowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\r\ndistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\r\nHarriet!\xe2\x80\x94It was an odd t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate; but she was glad to see it.\xe2\x80\x94There\r\nhad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\r\nturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\r\nconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been\r\nsorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;\r\nbut now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its\r\nappendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading\r\nflocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.\xe2\x80\x94She\r\njoined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in\r\nlooking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes of\r\nagriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nare my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without\r\nbeing suspected of introducing Robert Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She did not suspect him.\r\nIt was too old a story.\xe2\x80\x94Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of\r\nHarriet.\xe2\x80\x94They took a few turns together along the walk.\xe2\x80\x94The shade was\r\nmost refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\r\n\r\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;\xe2\x80\x94and they\r\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\r\nWeston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\r\nuneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\r\nthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\r\ncoming, with more than common certainty. \xe2\x80\x9cHis aunt was so much better,\r\nthat he had not a doubt of getting over to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\r\nsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\r\ndependence\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\r\nthat it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x94Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\r\nshe behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\r\n\r\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\r\nwhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as\r\nfar as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\r\nany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nWoodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\r\nof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by\r\nhim, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him,\r\nthat Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise\r\nand variety which her spirits seemed to need.\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\r\nshells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\r\nprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the\r\nkindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly\r\nwell amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he\r\nwould shew them all to Emma;\xe2\x80\x94fortunate in having no other resemblance\r\nto a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was\r\nslow, constant, and methodical.\xe2\x80\x94Before this second looking over was\r\nbegun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly\r\nin from the garden, and with a look of escape.\xe2\x80\x94Little expecting to meet\r\nMiss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse\r\nwas the very person she was in quest of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be so kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am missed, as to say that I am\r\ngone home?\xe2\x80\x94I am going this moment.\xe2\x80\x94My aunt is not aware how late it is,\r\nnor how long we have been absent\xe2\x80\x94but I am sure we shall be wanted, and\r\nI am determined to go directly.\xe2\x80\x94I have said nothing about it to any\r\nbody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to\r\nthe ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not\r\nbe missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I\r\nam gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if you wish it;\xe2\x80\x94but you are not going to walk to Highbury\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94what should hurt me?\xe2\x80\x94I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s servant go with you.\xe2\x80\x94Let me order the carriage. It can be\r\nround in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you\xe2\x80\x94but on no account.\xe2\x80\x94I would rather walk.\xe2\x80\x94And for\r\n_me_ to be afraid of walking alone!\xe2\x80\x94I, who may so soon have to guard\r\nothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\r\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.\xe2\x80\x94You are fatigued already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\r\nfatigue\xe2\x80\x94quick walking will refresh me.\xe2\x80\x94Miss Woodhouse, we all know at\r\ntimes what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\r\nexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me\r\nhave my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\r\nher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched\r\nher safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\r\ngrateful\xe2\x80\x94and her parting words, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\r\nbeing sometimes alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\r\nto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\r\neven towards some of those who loved her best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a home, indeed! such an aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, as she turned back into\r\nthe hall again. \xe2\x80\x9cI do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\r\ntheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\r\naccomplished some views of St. Mark\xe2\x80\x99s Place, Venice, when Frank\r\nChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\r\nforgotten to think of him\xe2\x80\x94but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\r\nwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right who\r\nhad named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by a\r\ntemporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\r\nlasted some hours\xe2\x80\x94and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\r\ntill very late;\xe2\x80\x94and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how\r\nlate, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\r\ncome at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\r\nlike it\xe2\x80\x94almost wished he had staid at home\xe2\x80\x94nothing killed him like\r\nheat\xe2\x80\x94he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\r\nintolerable\xe2\x80\x94and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\r\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s fire, looking very deplorable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\r\nspared\xe2\x80\x94but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\r\ngoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94Madness in such weather!\xe2\x80\x94absolute madness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\r\nhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\r\nhis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\r\nthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some\r\nrefreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\r\ndining-room\xe2\x80\x94and she humanely pointed out the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\r\nhotter.\xe2\x80\x9d In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\r\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all\r\nher attention to her father, saying in secret\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\r\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s sweet easy\r\ntemper will not mind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\r\nback all the better\xe2\x80\x94grown quite cool\xe2\x80\x94and, with good manners, like\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\r\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\r\nHe was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\r\nat last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\r\nover views in Swisserland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\r\nsketches, some time or other, to look at\xe2\x80\x94or my tour to read\xe2\x80\x94or my poem.\r\nI shall do something to expose myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be\xe2\x80\x94but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\r\nSwisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\r\nher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\r\nassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\r\nshall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\r\nwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\r\neyes may fancy\xe2\x80\x94I am sick of England\xe2\x80\x94and would leave it to-morrow, if I\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\r\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\r\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in\r\nevery thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\r\nperson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\r\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice\r\nof cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you\r\nnearly on a par with the rest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to Box Hill to-morrow;\xe2\x80\x94you will join us. It is not\r\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want\r\nof a change. You will stay, and go with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen pray stay at Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of\r\nyou all there without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\r\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\r\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\r\ntook it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\r\ndisturbance on Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance being explained. That it\r\nwas time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short\r\nfinal arrangement for the next day\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, they parted. Frank\r\nChurchill\xe2\x80\x99s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much,\r\nthat his last words to Emma were,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell;\xe2\x80\x94if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from\r\nRichmond was to take him back before the following evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\r\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\r\nfavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\r\nsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\r\ntime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\r\nthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\r\nWoodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\r\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\r\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\r\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of\r\nspirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated\r\ntoo much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took\r\ncharge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank\r\nChurchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise\r\nbetter. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never\r\nmaterially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness\r\nto mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole\r\nhours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\r\nseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine\r\nprospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\r\nChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing\xe2\x80\x94looked\r\nwithout seeing\xe2\x80\x94admired without intelligence\xe2\x80\x94listened without knowing\r\nwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\r\nshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\r\n\r\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\r\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first\r\nobject. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to\r\nher. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\r\ncared for\xe2\x80\x94and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\r\nwas gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the\r\nadmission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most\r\nanimating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own\r\nestimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people\r\nlooking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but\r\nflirtation could very well describe. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Frank Churchill and Miss\r\nWoodhouse flirted together excessively.\xe2\x80\x9d They were laying themselves\r\nopen to that very phrase\xe2\x80\x94and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple\r\nGrove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and\r\nthoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less\r\nhappy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;\r\nand though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,\r\nwhether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious,\r\nthey were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much I am obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor telling me to come\r\nto-day!\xe2\x80\x94If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\r\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that\r\nyou were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than\r\nyou deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hotter to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are comfortable because you are under command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour command?\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\r\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\r\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again\xe2\x80\x94and as I cannot be always\r\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\r\nrather than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\r\nmotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\r\nwith me. You are always with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDating from three o\xe2\x80\x99clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\r\nbegin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\r\nfirst in February.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)\xe2\x80\x94nobody\r\nspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\r\nnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing of which I am ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, with lively\r\nimpudence. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\r\nhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and\r\nDorking on the other. I saw you first in February.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nwhispering\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOur companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to\r\nrouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies and\r\ngentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\r\npresides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\r\ndeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s presiding; Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s answer was the most distinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\r\nthinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, no\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cUpon no\r\naccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\r\nof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all\r\nthinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,\r\n(glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be\r\nafraid of knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich _I_\r\nshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\r\nperhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party\xe2\x80\x94_I_ never was in any\r\ncircle\xe2\x80\x94exploring parties\xe2\x80\x94young ladies\xe2\x80\x94married women\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed\xe2\x80\x94quite unheard of\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nsome ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body\r\nknows what is due to _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not do,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Frank to Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are most of them\r\naffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\r\nknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\r\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\r\nare seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\r\nentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\r\nthing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated\xe2\x80\x94or two\r\nthings moderately clever\xe2\x80\x94or three things very dull indeed, and she\r\nengages to laugh heartily at them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very well,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Bates, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I need not be uneasy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three things very dull indeed.\xe2\x80\x99 That will just do for me, you know. I\r\nshall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on\r\nevery body\xe2\x80\x99s assent)\xe2\x80\x94Do not you all think I shall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not resist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ma\xe2\x80\x99am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me\xe2\x80\x94but you will be\r\nlimited as to number\xe2\x80\x94only three at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\r\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\r\nanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\r\nKnightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\r\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your plan,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cAgreed, agreed. I will do my\r\nbest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLow, I am afraid, sir, very low,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his son;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut we shall be\r\nindulgent\xe2\x80\x94especially to any one who leads the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cit will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\r\nhear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt its being very clever myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too\r\nmuch a matter of fact, but here it is.\xe2\x80\x94What two letters of the alphabet\r\nare there, that express perfection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat two letters!\xe2\x80\x94express perfection! I am sure I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\r\nguess.\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you.\xe2\x80\x94M. and A.\xe2\x80\x94Em-ma.\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnderstanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\r\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\r\nenjoy in it\xe2\x80\x94and so did Frank and Harriet.\xe2\x80\x94It did not seem to touch the\r\nrest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\r\nKnightley gravely said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\r\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\r\nelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elton; \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\r\nreally cannot attempt\xe2\x80\x94I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\r\nan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\r\npleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!\xe2\x80\x94You know\r\nwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well\r\nat Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\r\nplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in\r\nsummer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have\r\nwitty things at every body\xe2\x80\x99s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I\r\nhave a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be\r\nallowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if\r\nyou please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We\r\nhave nothing clever to say\xe2\x80\x94not one of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, pray pass _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d added her husband, with a sort of sneering\r\nconsciousness; \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\r\nWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man\xe2\x80\x94quite good for\r\nnothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\r\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy\r\ncouple!\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\r\nhearing:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow well they suit one another!\xe2\x80\x94Very lucky\xe2\x80\x94marrying as they\r\ndid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!\xe2\x80\x94They only knew\r\neach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!\xe2\x80\x94for as to\r\nany real knowledge of a person\xe2\x80\x99s disposition that Bath, or any public\r\nplace, can give\xe2\x80\x94it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\r\nonly by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\r\nthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\r\nis all guess and luck\xe2\x80\x94and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\r\nhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\r\nof his life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\r\nconfederates, spoke now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch things do occur, undoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She was stopped by a cough. Frank\r\nChurchill turned towards her to listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate\r\ncircumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot\r\nimagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may\r\narise\xe2\x80\x94but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I\r\nwould be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute\r\ncharacters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)\r\nwho will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an\r\noppression for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\r\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\r\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning\r\nto Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?\xe2\x80\x94I am sure I should like any\r\nbody fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a\r\nsmile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt\r\nher, educate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd make her like myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\r\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years\xe2\x80\x94and when I return, I shall come\r\nto you for my wife. Remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\r\nfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\r\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\r\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could\r\nsay? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane to her aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cshall we join Mrs. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\r\nready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\r\nsoon overtake her. There she is\xe2\x80\x94no, that\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of\r\nthe ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.\xe2\x80\x94Well, I\r\ndeclare\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.\r\nWeston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at\r\nlast of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking\r\nquietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and\r\nquite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views\r\nbeneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them to\r\ngive notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of\r\ncollecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to\r\nhave _her_ carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the\r\nquiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of\r\nthis day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many\r\nill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\r\nlooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\r\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use\r\nit. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could\r\nyou be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your\r\nwit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?\xe2\x80\x94Emma, I had not\r\nthought it possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, how could I help saying what I did?\xe2\x80\x94Nobody could have helped it.\r\nIt was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it\r\nsince. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it\xe2\x80\x94with what\r\ncandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\r\nforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\r\never receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\r\nso irksome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cI know there is not a better creature in the world:\r\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\r\nunfortunately blended in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are blended,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\r\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\r\nthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\r\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\r\nliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation\xe2\x80\x94but, Emma,\r\nconsider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\r\nfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\r\nprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\r\nbadly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she\r\nhad seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have\r\nyou now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at\r\nher, humble her\xe2\x80\x94and before her niece, too\xe2\x80\x94and before others, many of\r\nwhom (certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\r\nof her.\xe2\x80\x94This is not pleasant to you, Emma\xe2\x80\x94and it is very far from\r\npleasant to me; but I must, I will,\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you truths while I can;\r\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\r\ntrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than\r\nyou can do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\r\nready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\r\nmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\r\ntongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\r\nmortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,\r\non entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nreproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no\r\nacknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with\r\nvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He\r\nhad turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look\r\nback, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they\r\nwere half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was\r\nvexed beyond what could have been expressed\xe2\x80\x94almost beyond what she\r\ncould conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at\r\nany circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth\r\nof this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.\r\nHow could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could\r\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And\r\nhow suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of\r\nconcurrence, of common kindness!\r\n\r\nTime did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\r\nit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\r\nto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\r\nfagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\r\ndown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble\r\nto check them, extraordinary as they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts all the\r\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\r\nnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\r\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a\r\nmorning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\r\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\r\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her\r\nfather, was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for\r\nthere she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his\r\ncomfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond\r\naffection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct,\r\nbe open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not\r\nwithout a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cHow could\r\nyou be so unfeeling to your father?\xe2\x80\x94I must, I will tell you truths\r\nwhile I can.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bates should never again\xe2\x80\x94no, never! If attention, in\r\nfuture, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had\r\nbeen often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in\r\nthought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.\r\nIn the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next\r\nmorning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular,\r\nequal, kindly intercourse.\r\n\r\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\r\nnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\r\nmight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while\r\nshe were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\r\nashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\r\nHer eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ladies were all at home.\xe2\x80\x9d She had never rejoiced at the sound\r\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\r\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\r\nderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\r\n\r\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\r\nShe heard Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\r\nmaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait\r\na moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed\r\nboth escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse\r\nof, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she\r\nheard Miss Bates saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid\r\ndown upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did\r\nnot quite understand what was going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid Jane is not very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not know; they\r\n_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\r\nMiss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I\r\nam very little able\xe2\x80\x94Have you a chair, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? Do you sit where you like?\r\nI am sure she will be here presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s fear of Miss Bates\r\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cVery happy and\r\nobliged\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but Emma\xe2\x80\x99s conscience told her that there was not the same\r\ncheerful volubility as before\xe2\x80\x94less ease of look and manner. A very\r\nfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\r\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!\xe2\x80\x94I suppose you have heard\xe2\x80\x94and are\r\ncome to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94(twinkling away a tear or two)\xe2\x80\x94but it will be very trying for us to\r\npart with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\r\nheadache just now, writing all the morning:\xe2\x80\x94such long letters, you\r\nknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. \xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, \xe2\x80\x98you will blind yourself\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94for tears were in her eyes\r\nperpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great\r\nchange; and though she is amazingly fortunate\xe2\x80\x94such a situation, I\r\nsuppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nnot think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good\r\nfortune\xe2\x80\x94(again dispersing her tears)\xe2\x80\x94but, poor dear soul! if you were\r\nto see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one\r\ncannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as\r\npossible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy\r\nshe is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x94she is not able\xe2\x80\x94she is gone into her own room\xe2\x80\x94I want her to lie\r\ndown upon the bed. \xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I shall say you are laid down\r\nupon the bed:\xe2\x80\x99 but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room.\r\nBut, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be\r\nwell. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\r\nbut your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas quite ashamed\xe2\x80\x94but somehow there was a little bustle\xe2\x80\x94for it so\r\nhappened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the\r\nstairs, we did not know any body was coming. \xe2\x80\x98It is only Mrs. Cole,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, \xe2\x80\x98depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x98it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut then Patty came in, and said it was you. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98it is Miss\r\nWoodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I can see nobody,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us\r\nkeep you waiting\xe2\x80\x94and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. \xe2\x80\x98If you must\r\ngo, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98you must, and I will say you are laid down upon\r\nthe bed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\r\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\r\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\r\nbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\r\nsensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\r\nnaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when\r\nshe might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest\r\nregret and solicitude\xe2\x80\x94sincerely wishing that the circumstances which\r\nshe collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might\r\nbe as much for Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s advantage and comfort as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmust be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be\r\ndelayed till Colonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo very kind!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Bates. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are always kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no bearing such an \xe2\x80\x9calways;\xe2\x80\x9d and to break through her\r\ndreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x94may I ask?\xe2\x80\x94is Miss Fairfax going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a Mrs. Smallridge\xe2\x80\x94charming woman\xe2\x80\x94most superior\xe2\x80\x94to have the charge\r\nof her three little girls\xe2\x80\x94delightful children. Impossible that any\r\nsituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\r\nMrs. Suckling\xe2\x80\x99s own family, and Mrs. Bragge\xe2\x80\x99s; but Mrs. Smallridge is\r\nintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:\xe2\x80\x94lives only four\r\nmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\r\nwould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, \xe2\x80\x98No;\xe2\x80\x99 for when\r\nJane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very\r\nmorning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite\r\ndecided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;\r\nexactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till\r\nColonel Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into\r\nany engagement at present\xe2\x80\x94and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\r\nmind!\xe2\x80\x94but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\r\nfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\r\nsuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane\xe2\x80\x99s answer; but she\r\npositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\r\nJane wished her; she would wait\xe2\x80\x94and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\r\nwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\r\nthe least idea!\xe2\x80\x94Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\r\nupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge\xe2\x80\x99s situation, she\r\nhad come to the resolution of accepting it.\xe2\x80\x94I did not know a word of it\r\ntill it was all settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\r\nthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. \xe2\x80\x98You _must_\r\n_all_ spend your evening with us,\xe2\x80\x99 said she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I positively must have you\r\n_all_ come.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Knightley was there too, was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\r\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\r\nhim off, he did not;\xe2\x80\x94but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\r\nand a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\r\nWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\r\nrather fagged after the morning\xe2\x80\x99s party. Even pleasure, you know, is\r\nfatiguing\xe2\x80\x94and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\r\nenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\r\nand feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\r\nmaking up her mind the whole day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say she had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in\r\nthe world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\r\nBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\r\nand elegant, in all Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\r\ndelightful woman!\xe2\x80\x94A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\nto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\r\nare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\r\nsuch regard and kindness!\xe2\x80\x94It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x94And her salary!\xe2\x80\x94I really cannot venture to name her salary to\r\nyou, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\r\nhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like\r\nJane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cif other children are at all like what I\r\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\r\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\r\nearned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so noble in your ideas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon, very soon, indeed; that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of it. Within a\r\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not\r\nknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\r\nsay, Come ma\xe2\x80\x99am, do not let us think about it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\r\nMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before\r\ntheir return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a\r\nsituation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so\r\nastonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs.\r\nElton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me\r\nupon it! It was before tea\xe2\x80\x94stay\xe2\x80\x94no, it could not be before tea, because\r\nwe were just going to cards\xe2\x80\x94and yet it was before tea, because I\r\nremember thinking\xe2\x80\x94Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something\r\nhappened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room\r\nbefore tea, old John Abdy\xe2\x80\x99s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old\r\nJohn, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father\r\ntwenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very\r\npoorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints\xe2\x80\x94I must go and see him\r\nto-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he\r\nis very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,\r\nostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his\r\nfather without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us\r\nwhat John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the\r\nchaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to\r\nRichmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane\r\nspoke to Mrs. Elton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\r\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\r\ncould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\r\naccumulation of the ostler\xe2\x80\x99s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\r\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\r\nsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill\xe2\x80\x94which messenger,\r\nhowever, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\r\nsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\r\naccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\r\nback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\r\nresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\r\nseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\r\nCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\r\ngoing a good pace, and driving very steady.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\r\ncaught Emma\xe2\x80\x99s attention only as it united with the subject which\r\nalready engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s, struck her; one was every\r\nthing, the other nothing\xe2\x80\x94and she sat musing on the difference of\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\r\ntill roused by Miss Bates\xe2\x80\x99s saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\r\nof that?\xe2\x80\x94Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98You\r\nmust go,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98You and I must part. You will have no business\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x94Let it stay, however,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98give it houseroom till Colonel\r\nCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\r\nme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94And to this day, I do\r\nbelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\r\nall her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\r\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long\r\nenough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to\r\nsay of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\r\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\r\nKnightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\r\nwith her father.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\r\ndecidedly graver than usual, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\r\nand therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\r\na few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\r\nbesides the \xe2\x80\x98love,\xe2\x80\x99 which nobody carries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94rather\xe2\x80\x94I have been thinking of it some little time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\r\nhowever, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\r\nagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going\xe2\x80\x94her father\r\nbegan his inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, and did you get there safely?\xe2\x80\x94And how did you find my\r\nworthy old friend and her daughter?\xe2\x80\x94I dare say they must have been very\r\nmuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and\r\nMiss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\r\nattentive to them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\r\nand shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\r\nKnightley.\xe2\x80\x94It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\r\nher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\r\nhad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nanother moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\r\nfriendliness on his part.\xe2\x80\x94He took her hand;\xe2\x80\x94whether she had not herself\r\nmade the first motion, she could not say\xe2\x80\x94she might, perhaps, have\r\nrather offered it\xe2\x80\x94but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was\r\non the point of carrying it to his lips\xe2\x80\x94when, from some fancy or other,\r\nhe suddenly let it go.\xe2\x80\x94Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should\r\nchange his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.\xe2\x80\x94He\r\nwould have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nintention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his\r\nmanners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\r\nhappened, but she thought nothing became him more.\xe2\x80\x94It was with him, of\r\nso simple, yet so dignified a nature.\xe2\x80\x94She could not but recall the\r\nattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.\xe2\x80\x94He left\r\nthem immediately afterwards\xe2\x80\x94gone in a moment. He always moved with the\r\nalertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\r\nnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\r\n\r\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\r\nhad left her ten minutes earlier;\xe2\x80\x94it would have been a great pleasure\r\nto talk over Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s situation with Mr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x94Neither would\r\nshe regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew\r\nhow much his visit would be enjoyed\xe2\x80\x94but it might have happened at a\r\nbetter time\xe2\x80\x94and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\r\npleasanter.\xe2\x80\x94They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be\r\ndeceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\r\ngallantry;\xe2\x80\x94it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\r\nhis good opinion.\xe2\x80\x94He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\r\nfound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\r\n\r\nIn the hope of diverting her father\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts from the\r\ndisagreeableness of Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s going to London; and going so\r\nsuddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\r\nEmma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the\r\neffect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,\xe2\x80\x94interested,\r\nwithout disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s going to London had been an unexpected blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\r\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\r\nher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\r\nsituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\r\nbe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s always was with me.\r\nYou know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\r\nwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\r\ninduced to go away after it has been her home so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\r\ninto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\r\nto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\r\nhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\r\nthing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\r\nstruggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\r\n\r\nIt was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\r\ngravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\r\nsurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\r\nshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\r\nto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\r\ndisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\r\nMrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\r\nnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\r\njustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\r\nevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\r\nimaginary complaints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\r\nmore than any body had ever supposed\xe2\x80\x94and continual pain would try the\r\ntemper. It was a sad event\xe2\x80\x94a great shock\xe2\x80\x94with all her faults, what\r\nwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s loss would be\r\ndreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Even Mr.\r\nWeston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! poor woman,\r\nwho would have thought it!\xe2\x80\x9d and resolved, that his mourning should be\r\nas handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over\r\nher broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.\r\nHow it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It\r\nwas also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.\r\nChurchill, the grief of her husband\xe2\x80\x94her mind glanced over them both\r\nwith awe and compassion\xe2\x80\x94and then rested with lightened feelings on how\r\nFrank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw\r\nin a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith\r\nwould have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his\r\nwife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into\r\nany thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the\r\nnephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the\r\ncause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.\r\n\r\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great\r\nself-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed\r\nnothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of\r\nstrengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might\r\nendanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath with mutual forbearance.\r\n\r\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\r\nthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\r\nwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\r\ndeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a\r\nvery old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\r\nvisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\r\nHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\r\non Emma\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\r\nprospects were closing, while Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s opened, and whose engagements\r\nnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\r\nkindness\xe2\x80\x94and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\r\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\r\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\r\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\r\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and\r\ntestify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to\r\nspend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation\r\nwas refused, and by a verbal message. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fairfax was not well enough\r\nto write;\xe2\x80\x9d and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it\r\nappeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\r\nthough against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\r\nunder severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him\r\ndoubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge\xe2\x80\x99s at the time\r\nproposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged\xe2\x80\x94appetite\r\nquite gone\xe2\x80\x94and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms,\r\nnothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing\r\napprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought\r\nshe had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so\r\nherself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\r\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\r\ndisorder:\xe2\x80\x94confined always to one room;\xe2\x80\x94he could have wished it\r\notherwise\xe2\x80\x94and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\r\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\r\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\r\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\r\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\r\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\r\nway of being useful. To take her\xe2\x80\x94be it only an hour or two\xe2\x80\x94from her\r\naunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\r\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\r\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\r\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\r\nhour that Jane would name\xe2\x80\x94mentioning that she had Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s decided\r\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was\r\nonly in this short note:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\r\nexercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\r\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\r\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\r\ncounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\r\nanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nin the hope that Jane would be induced to join her\xe2\x80\x94but it would not\r\ndo;\xe2\x80\x94Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\r\nwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\r\nservice\xe2\x80\x94and every thing that message could do was tried\xe2\x80\x94but all in\r\nvain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite\r\nunpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\r\nworse.\xe2\x80\x94Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\r\nbut, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\r\nthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\r\nbody\xe2\x80\x94any body at all\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs.\r\nCole had made such a point\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Perry had said so much\xe2\x80\x94but, except\r\nthem, Jane would really see nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\r\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\r\nshe feel any right of preference herself\xe2\x80\x94she submitted, therefore, and\r\nonly questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece\xe2\x80\x99s appetite and diet,\r\nwhich she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\r\nwas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\r\nthing:\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they\r\ncould command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\r\ndistasteful.\r\n\r\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\r\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\r\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In\r\nhalf an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from\r\nMiss Bates, but \xe2\x80\x9cdear Jane would not be satisfied without its being\r\nsent back; it was a thing she could not take\xe2\x80\x94and, moreover, she\r\ninsisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\r\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\r\nthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\r\nexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\r\nshe could have no doubt\xe2\x80\x94putting every thing together\xe2\x80\x94that Jane was\r\nresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\r\nHer heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\r\nfrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\r\ninequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\r\ncredit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend:\r\nbut she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good,\r\nand of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been\r\nprivy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have\r\nseen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any\r\nthing to reprove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s decease, Emma was\r\ncalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \xe2\x80\x9ccould not stay five minutes, and\r\nwanted particularly to speak with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94He met her at the parlour-door,\r\nand hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice,\r\nsunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you come to Randalls at any time this morning?\xe2\x80\x94Do, if it be\r\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she unwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not at all\xe2\x80\x94only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\r\ncarriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94(nodding towards her father)\xe2\x80\x94Humph!\xe2\x80\x94Can you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\r\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?\xe2\x80\x94Is she really not\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon me\xe2\x80\x94but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\r\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\r\nreally important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\r\nwell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her\r\nfather, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon\r\nout of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for\r\nRandalls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he gravely replied.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. I promised my wife to\r\nleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\r\nbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreak it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, standing still with terror.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nGod!\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Weston, tell me at once.\xe2\x80\x94Something has happened in Brunswick\r\nSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what\r\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Weston do not trifle with me.\xe2\x80\x94Consider how many of my dearest\r\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?\xe2\x80\x94I charge you\r\nby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, Emma.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour word!\xe2\x80\x94why not your honour!\xe2\x80\x94why not say upon your honour, that it\r\nhas nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!\xe2\x80\x94What can be to be\r\n_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said he very seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cit does not. It is not in\r\nthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\r\nKnightley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s courage returned, and she walked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cin talking of its being _broke_ to you. I\r\nshould not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94it concerns only myself,\xe2\x80\x94that is, we hope.\xe2\x80\x94Humph!\xe2\x80\x94In short, my dear\r\nEmma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that\r\nit is not a disagreeable business\xe2\x80\x94but things might be much worse.\xe2\x80\x94If we\r\nwalk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\r\nasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\r\nthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\r\nconcern\xe2\x80\x94something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\r\ncircumstances of the family,\xe2\x80\x94something which the late event at Richmond\r\nhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\r\nchildren, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94and poor Frank cut off!\xe2\x80\x94This, though very\r\nundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little\r\nmore than an animating curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that gentleman on horseback?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as they\r\nproceeded\xe2\x80\x94speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\r\nthan with any other view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know.\xe2\x80\x94One of the Otways.\xe2\x80\x94Not Frank;\xe2\x80\x94it is not Frank, I assure\r\nyou. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your son been with you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes\xe2\x80\x94did not you know?\xe2\x80\x94Well, well, never mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\r\nand demure,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, as they entered the room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought her, and now I hope you\r\nwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\r\ndelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And Emma distinctly\r\nheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\r\nthat Emma\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\r\neagerly said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\r\nfind, has occurred;\xe2\x80\x94do let me know directly what it is. I have been\r\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do\r\nnot let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\r\ndistress, whatever it may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you indeed no idea?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCannot you, my dear Emma\xe2\x80\x94cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\r\nhear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\nbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\r\nimpossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\r\nsubject,\xe2\x80\x94to announce an attachment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\r\nHarriet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than an attachment, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs. Weston; \xe2\x80\x9can\r\nengagement\xe2\x80\x94a positive engagement.\xe2\x80\x94What will you say, Emma\xe2\x80\x94what will any\r\nbody say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\r\nengaged;\xe2\x80\x94nay, that they have been long engaged!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma even jumped with surprize;\xe2\x80\x94and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJane Fairfax!\xe2\x80\x94Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well be amazed,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her\r\neyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to\r\nrecover\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cYou may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a\r\nsolemn engagement between them ever since October\xe2\x80\x94formed at Weymouth,\r\nand kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.\xe2\x80\x94It is so\r\nwonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet\r\nalmost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.\xe2\x80\x94I thought I knew\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.\xe2\x80\x94Her mind was divided between two\r\nideas\xe2\x80\x94her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\r\npoor Harriet;\xe2\x80\x94and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\r\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she at last, trying to recover herself; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a\r\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\r\nall comprehend it. What!\xe2\x80\x94engaged to her all the winter\xe2\x80\x94before either of\r\nthem came to Highbury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngaged since October,\xe2\x80\x94secretly engaged.\xe2\x80\x94It has hurt me, Emma, very\r\nmuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\r\ncannot excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not pretend _not_ to\r\nunderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\r\nthat no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\r\napprehensive of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was as\r\nsteady as her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\r\npresent perfect indifference,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI will farther tell you,\r\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\r\ndid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nwas attached\xe2\x80\x94and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\r\nFortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\r\nfor at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\r\nbelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\r\nutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\r\nthan any thing else in the world could do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cOn\r\nthis point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\r\nmight be attached to each other\xe2\x80\x94and we were persuaded that it was so.\xe2\x80\x94\r\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\r\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\r\nand I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to\r\ncome among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so\r\n_very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he\r\ncertainly did\xe2\x80\x94to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\r\nattention, as he certainly did\xe2\x80\x94while he really belonged to another?\xe2\x80\x94How\r\ncould he tell what mischief he might be doing?\xe2\x80\x94How could he tell that\r\nhe might not be making me in love with him?\xe2\x80\x94very wrong, very wrong\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to\r\nlook on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\r\nbefore her face, and not resent it.\xe2\x80\x94That is a degree of placidity,\r\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\r\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\r\nquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the\r\nfull use even of the time he could stay\xe2\x80\x94but that there had been\r\nmisunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed\r\nto be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\r\npossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x94it is too calm a censure. Much, much\r\nbeyond impropriety!\xe2\x80\x94It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\r\nin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!\xe2\x80\x94None of that upright\r\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain\r\nof trick and littleness, which a man should display in every\r\ntransaction of his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\r\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\r\nmany, very many, good qualities; and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, not attending to her.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Smallridge, too!\r\nJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\r\nsuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself\xe2\x80\x94to suffer her\r\neven to think of such a measure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\r\nhim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him\xe2\x80\x94or at\r\nleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.\xe2\x80\x94Till yesterday, I\r\nknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I\r\ndo not know how, but by some letter or message\xe2\x80\x94and it was the discovery\r\nof what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined\r\nhim to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\r\nhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\r\nconcealment that had been carrying on so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma began to listen better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to hear from him soon,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cHe told me at\r\nparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\r\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\r\nus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\r\nmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be\r\nunderstood. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let us be severe, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us be in a hurry to\r\ncondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\r\nsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\r\nfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\r\nboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\r\nconcealment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_His_ sufferings,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not appear to have done him\r\nmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost favourably for his nephew\xe2\x80\x94gave his consent with scarcely a\r\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that\r\nfamily! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have\r\nbeen a hope, a chance, a possibility;\xe2\x80\x94but scarcely are her remains at\r\nrest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly\r\nopposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when\r\nundue influence does not survive the grave!\xe2\x80\x94He gave his consent with\r\nvery little persuasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Emma, \xe2\x80\x9che would have done as much for Harriet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\r\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates\xe2\x80\x99s, I fancy, some time\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\r\nto whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\r\nhe could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x94He was very much\r\nagitated\xe2\x80\x94very much, indeed\xe2\x80\x94to a degree that made him appear quite a\r\ndifferent creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.\xe2\x80\x94In\r\naddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\r\nvery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of\xe2\x80\x94and there was\r\nevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with\r\nsuch perfect secresy?\xe2\x80\x94The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know\r\nof the engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being\r\nin the world but their two selves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\r\nidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very\r\nabominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\r\nhypocrisy and deceit,\xe2\x80\x94espionage, and treachery?\xe2\x80\x94To come among us with\r\nprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to\r\njudge us all!\xe2\x80\x94Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\r\ncompletely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\r\nand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\r\ncarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\r\nwords that were never meant for both to hear.\xe2\x80\x94They must take the\r\nconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\r\nperfectly agreeable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite easy on that head,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sure\r\nthat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might\r\nnot have heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in luck.\xe2\x80\x94Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\r\nimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\r\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\r\nas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the\r\nwindow, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited\r\nhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, dearest Emma, let\r\nme intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at\r\nease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the\r\nbest of it\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her\r\nfavour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not\r\nfeel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance\r\nfor him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a\r\ngirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always\r\ngiven her credit for\xe2\x80\x94and still am disposed to give her credit for, in\r\nspite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And\r\nhow much may be said in her situation for even that error!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma feelingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a woman can ever be excused\r\nfor thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\r\nFairfax\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x94Of such, one may almost say, that \xe2\x80\x98the world is not their\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nnor the world\xe2\x80\x99s law.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\r\nexclaiming,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\r\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent\r\nof guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\r\nyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\r\ncondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.\xe2\x80\x94I congratulate\r\nyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of\r\nthe most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\r\nright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\r\nwas immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he\r\nshook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the\r\nsubject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and\r\npersuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companions\r\nsuggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;\r\nand by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked\r\nit all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was\r\nbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best\r\nthing that Frank could possibly have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet, poor Harriet!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Those were the words; in them lay the\r\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\r\nthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved\r\nvery ill by herself\xe2\x80\x94very ill in many ways,\xe2\x80\x94but it was not so much _his_\r\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\r\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s account, that gave the\r\ndeepest hue to his offence.\xe2\x80\x94Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe\r\nof her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\r\nprophetically, when he once said, \xe2\x80\x9cEmma, you have been no friend to\r\nHarriet Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She was afraid she had done her nothing but\r\ndisservice.\xe2\x80\x94It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\r\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\r\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\r\nnever have entered Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\r\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\r\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of\r\nhaving encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\r\nprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\r\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\r\nto have prevented them.\xe2\x80\x94She felt that she had been risking her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have\r\ndirected her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think\r\nof him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his\r\never caring for her.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut, with common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid\r\nI have had little to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\r\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.\xe2\x80\x94As for Jane\r\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\r\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no\r\nlonger be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\r\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.\xe2\x80\x94Her\r\ndays of insignificance and evil were over.\xe2\x80\x94She would soon be well, and\r\nhappy, and prosperous.\xe2\x80\x94Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\r\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\r\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.\xe2\x80\x94In Jane\xe2\x80\x99s eyes she had been a rival;\r\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\r\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\r\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\r\nunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\r\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\r\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\r\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was\r\nlittle sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\r\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\r\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\r\njudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s mind, producing\r\nreserve and self-command, it would.\xe2\x80\x94She must communicate the painful\r\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\r\nbeen among Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s parting words. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the present, the whole\r\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\r\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and\r\nevery body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Emma had\r\npromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\r\nridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\r\noffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through\r\nby herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to\r\nher, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat\r\nquick on hearing Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had\r\npoor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the\r\nevent of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!\xe2\x80\x94But of that,\r\nunfortunately, there could be no chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Woodhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nnot this the oddest news that ever was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\r\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nneed not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\r\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\r\nand, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but\r\nyou, but he said you knew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Mr. Weston tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Emma, still perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\r\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\r\nanother this long while. How very odd!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour was so extremely odd, that\r\nEmma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\r\nabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\r\ndisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\r\nher, quite unable to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you any idea,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, \xe2\x80\x9cof his being in love with her?\xe2\x80\x94You,\r\nperhaps, might.\xe2\x80\x94You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\r\nbody\xe2\x80\x99s heart; but nobody else\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to doubt my having any such talent.\r\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to\r\nanother woman at the very time that I was\xe2\x80\x94tacitly, if not\r\nopenly\xe2\x80\x94encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?\xe2\x80\x94I never had\r\nthe slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\r\nChurchill\xe2\x80\x99s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\r\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you caution\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x94You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nEmma, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you do not mean to deny that there was a time\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot very distant either\xe2\x80\x94when you gave me reason to understand that you\r\ndid care about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim!\xe2\x80\x94never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nturning away distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x94Good\r\nHeaven! what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x94Mistake you!\xe2\x80\x94Am I to suppose then?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not speak another word.\xe2\x80\x94Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\r\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\r\n\r\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\r\nher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\r\nin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not have thought it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you could\r\nhave misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nconsidering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should\r\nnot have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other\r\nperson. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look\r\nat him in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than\r\nto think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And\r\nthat you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!\xe2\x80\x94I am sure, but for\r\nbelieving that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my\r\nattachment, I should have considered it at first too great a\r\npresumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not\r\ntold me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\r\nmatches of greater disparity (those were your very words);\xe2\x80\x94I should not\r\nhave dared to give way to\xe2\x80\x94I should not have thought it possible\xe2\x80\x94But if\r\n_you_, who had been always acquainted with him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet us understand\r\neach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\r\nspeaking of\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else\xe2\x80\x94and so I\r\nthought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Emma, with forced calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all that you\r\nthen said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could\r\nalmost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the\r\nservice Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from\r\nthe gipsies, was spoken of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\r\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that\r\nconsidering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\r\nnatural:\xe2\x80\x94and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\r\nyour sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations\r\nhad been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.\xe2\x80\x94The impression of\r\nit is strong on my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harriet, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I recollect what you mean; but I was\r\nthinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\r\ngipsies\xe2\x80\x94it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\r\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance\xe2\x80\x94of Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\r\nstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\r\nwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity;\r\nthat was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to\r\nevery other being upon earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, \xe2\x80\x9cthis has been a most unfortunate\xe2\x80\x94most\r\ndeplorable mistake!\xe2\x80\x94What is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\r\nleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\r\nother had been the person; and now\xe2\x80\x94it _is_ possible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should feel a\r\ngreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\r\nthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\r\nI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing\xe2\x80\x94that if\xe2\x80\x94strange as it may\r\nappear\xe2\x80\x94. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\r\nthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place\r\nthan between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if\r\nsuch a thing even as this, may have occurred before\xe2\x80\x94and if I should be\r\nso fortunate, beyond expression, as to\xe2\x80\x94if Mr. Knightley should\r\nreally\xe2\x80\x94if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss\r\nWoodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put\r\ndifficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look\r\nat her in consternation, and hastily said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any idea of Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s returning your affection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI must say that I\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\r\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\r\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once\r\nopening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched\xe2\x80\x94she admitted\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nacknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet\r\nshould be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why\r\nwas the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s having some hope of a\r\nreturn? It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr.\r\nKnightley must marry no one but herself!\r\n\r\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\r\nfew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\r\nher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\r\ninconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\r\nher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck\r\nher with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in\r\nthe world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of\r\nall these demerits\xe2\x80\x94some concern for her own appearance, and a strong\r\nsense of justice by Harriet\xe2\x80\x94(there would be no need of _compassion_ to\r\nthe girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x94but justice\r\nrequired that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave\r\nEmma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even\r\napparent kindness.\xe2\x80\x94For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the\r\nutmost extent of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet\r\nhad done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so\r\nvoluntarily formed and maintained\xe2\x80\x94or to deserve to be slighted by the\r\nperson, whose counsels had never led her right.\xe2\x80\x94Rousing from\r\nreflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet\r\nagain, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as\r\nto the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of\r\nJane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.\xe2\x80\x94Neither of them thought but\r\nof Mr. Knightley and themselves.\r\n\r\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\r\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\r\nand such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to\r\ngive the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\r\ndelight.\xe2\x80\x94Emma\xe2\x80\x99s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were\r\nbetter concealed than Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s, but they were not less. Her voice was\r\nnot unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a\r\ndevelopment of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion\r\nof sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.\xe2\x80\x94She listened with much\r\ninward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetail.\xe2\x80\x94Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could\r\nnot be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the\r\nfeebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her\r\nspirit\xe2\x80\x94especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own\r\nmemory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s most improved opinion of\r\nHarriet.\r\n\r\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\r\nthose two decisive dances.\xe2\x80\x94Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\r\nfound her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\r\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging her to think of\r\nhim, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more\r\nthan he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different\r\nmanner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!\xe2\x80\x94Latterly she\r\nhad been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking\r\ntogether, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\r\ndelightfully!\xe2\x80\x94He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\r\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\r\nalmost the same extent.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and\r\npraise from him\xe2\x80\x94and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with\r\nwhat she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being\r\nwithout art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\r\nfeelings.\xe2\x80\x94She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had\r\ndwelt on them to her more than once.\xe2\x80\x94Much that lived in Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\r\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a\r\ncompliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because\r\nunsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had\r\npassed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest\r\noccurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet,\r\nwere not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.\xe2\x80\x94The first,\r\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at\r\nDonwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he\r\nhad taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way\r\nthan he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!\xe2\x80\x94(Harriet\r\ncould not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking\r\nher, whether her affections were engaged.\xe2\x80\x94But as soon as she (Miss\r\nWoodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and\r\nbegan talking about farming:\xe2\x80\x94The second, was his having sat talking\r\nwith her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the\r\nvery last morning of his being at Hartfield\xe2\x80\x94though, when he first came\r\nin, he had said that he could not stay five minutes\xe2\x80\x94and his having told\r\nher, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it\r\nwas very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which\r\nwas much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The\r\nsuperior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article\r\nmarked, gave her severe pain.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\r\nlittle reflection, venture the following question. \xe2\x80\x9cMight he not?\xe2\x80\x94Is\r\nnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\r\nyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin\xe2\x80\x94he might have Mr.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Martin! No indeed!\xe2\x80\x94There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\r\nknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\r\nWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never should have presumed to think of it at first,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be\r\nthe rule of mine\xe2\x80\x94and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\r\ndeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\r\nvery wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\r\nfeelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma\xe2\x80\x99s side, to enable\r\nher to say on reply,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the\r\nlast man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea\r\nof his feeling for her more than he really does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\r\nsatisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\r\nat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\r\nmuch agitated to encounter him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe could not compose herself\xe2\x80\x94 Mr.\r\nWoodhouse would be alarmed\xe2\x80\x94she had better go;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with most ready\r\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\r\nanother door\xe2\x80\x94and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous\r\nburst of Emma\xe2\x80\x99s feelings: \xe2\x80\x9cOh God! that I had never seen her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\r\nthoughts.\xe2\x80\x94She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\r\nrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\r\nfresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x94How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\r\nbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!\xe2\x80\x94The blunders, the\r\nblindness of her own head and heart!\xe2\x80\x94she sat still, she walked about,\r\nshe tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery\xe2\x80\x94in every place, every\r\nposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\r\nbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\r\nbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was\r\nwretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\r\nendeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\r\n\r\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\r\ndeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\r\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?\xe2\x80\x94She looked back; she\r\ncompared the two\xe2\x80\x94compared them, as they had always stood in her\r\nestimation, from the time of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s becoming known to her\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\nthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it\xe2\x80\x94oh! had it, by\r\nany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.\xe2\x80\x94She\r\nsaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\r\nKnightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had\r\nnot been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\r\nin fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\r\ndelusion, totally ignorant of her own heart\xe2\x80\x94and, in short, that she had\r\nnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\r\n\r\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the\r\nknowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she\r\nreached; and without being long in reaching it.\xe2\x80\x94She was most\r\nsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\r\nto her\xe2\x80\x94her affection for Mr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x94Every other part of her mind\r\nwas disgusting.\r\n\r\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of\r\nevery body\xe2\x80\x99s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange\r\nevery body\xe2\x80\x99s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken;\r\nand she had not quite done nothing\xe2\x80\x94for she had done mischief. She had\r\nbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\r\nKnightley.\xe2\x80\x94Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\r\nher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\r\nattachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s;\xe2\x80\x94and even were this not the case, he would never have known\r\nHarriet at all but for her folly.\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!\xe2\x80\x94It was a union to distance every\r\nwonder of the kind.\xe2\x80\x94The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\r\nbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\r\nsurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\r\nthought.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!\xe2\x80\x94Such an elevation on her\r\nside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\r\nmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the\r\nsneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification\r\nand disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x94Could it be?\xe2\x80\x94No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very\r\nfar, from impossible.\xe2\x80\x94Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate\r\nabilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one,\r\nperhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x94Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal,\r\ninconsistent, incongruous\xe2\x80\x94or for chance and circumstance (as second\r\ncauses) to direct the human fate?\r\n\r\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\r\nought, and where he had told her she ought!\xe2\x80\x94Had she not, with a folly\r\nwhich no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\r\nunexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\r\nin the line of life to which she ought to belong\xe2\x80\x94all would have been\r\nsafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\r\n\r\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts\r\nto Mr. Knightley!\xe2\x80\x94How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of\r\nsuch a man till actually assured of it!\xe2\x80\x94But Harriet was less humble,\r\nhad fewer scruples than formerly.\xe2\x80\x94Her inferiority, whether of mind or\r\nsituation, seemed little felt.\xe2\x80\x94She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\r\nElton\xe2\x80\x99s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\r\nKnightley\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x94Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\r\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?\xe2\x80\x94Who but\r\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\r\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?\xe2\x80\x94If\r\nHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\r\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\r\nfirst in interest and affection.\xe2\x80\x94Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\r\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\r\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\r\nbeen.\xe2\x80\x94Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\r\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\r\ncould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\r\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\r\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\r\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\r\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he\r\nwould not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nstill, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of\r\nmind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an\r\nendeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\r\nother creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew\r\nshe was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?\xe2\x80\x94When the suggestions\r\nof hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she\r\ncould not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself\r\nnot unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by\r\nMr. Knightley. _She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any\r\nidea of blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very\r\nrecent proof of its impartiality.\xe2\x80\x94How shocked had he been by her\r\nbehaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed\r\nhimself to her on the subject!\xe2\x80\x94Not too strongly for the offence\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nfar, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright\r\njustice and clear-sighted goodwill.\xe2\x80\x94She had no hope, nothing to deserve\r\nthe name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself\r\nwhich was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one,\r\nat times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and\r\nbe overrating his regard for _her_.\xe2\x80\x94Wish it she must, for his sake\xe2\x80\x94be\r\nthe consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his\r\nlife. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at\r\nall, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.\xe2\x80\x94Let him but\r\ncontinue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr.\r\nKnightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of\r\ntheir precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\r\nwould be fully secured.\xe2\x80\x94Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It\r\nwould be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what\r\nshe felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She\r\nwould not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\r\n\r\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\r\nhoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be\r\nable to ascertain what the chances for it were.\xe2\x80\x94She should see them\r\nhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\r\nhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know\r\nhow to admit that she could be blinded here.\xe2\x80\x94He was expected back every\r\nday. The power of observation would be soon given\xe2\x80\x94frightfully soon it\r\nappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\r\nresolved against seeing Harriet.\xe2\x80\x94It would do neither of them good, it\r\nwould do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.\xe2\x80\x94She was\r\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\r\nno authority for opposing Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. To talk would be only\r\nto irritate.\xe2\x80\x94She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to\r\nbeg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it\r\nto be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\r\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were\r\nallowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94she objected only to a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate\xe2\x80\x94they might be able to act as\r\nif they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet submitted,\r\nand approved, and was grateful.\r\n\r\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\r\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston, who had\r\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\r\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\r\nrelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s, and gone through his\r\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\r\ninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\r\nmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a\r\nquarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s parlour, with all the\r\nencumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.\r\n\r\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\r\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\r\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at\r\nall at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,\r\nand to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and\r\nMr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement\xe2\x80\x99s becoming known;\r\nas, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\r\nwithout leading to reports:\xe2\x80\x94but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\r\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\r\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\r\nor if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for \xe2\x80\x9csuch things,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe observed, \xe2\x80\x9calways got about.\xe2\x80\x9d Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\r\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short\xe2\x80\x94and very\r\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\r\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\r\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\r\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x94who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\r\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\r\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\r\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\r\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\r\nFairfax\xe2\x80\x99s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\r\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\r\non being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs.\r\nWeston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\r\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\r\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first\r\nreception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always\r\nfeeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the\r\ncause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good\r\ndeal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.\r\nWeston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief\r\nto her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so\r\nlong been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\r\nmany months,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was energetic. This was one\r\nof her expressions. \xe2\x80\x98I will not say, that since I entered into the\r\nengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I\r\nhave never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and the quivering\r\nlip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cShe thinks herself wrong, then, for having\r\nconsented to a private engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to\r\nblame herself. \xe2\x80\x98The consequence,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98has been a state of\r\nperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the\r\npunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\r\nPain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting\r\ncontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\r\nthing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\r\nconscience tells me ought not to be.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do not imagine, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x98that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on\r\nthe principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error\r\nhas been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that\r\npresent circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the\r\nstory known to Colonel Campbell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe loves him then excessively, I\r\nsuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led\r\nto form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\r\njudgment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Emma, sighing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I must often have\r\ncontributed to make her unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably\r\nhad something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\r\nmisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\r\nconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\r\namiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\r\nand irritable to a degree that must have been\xe2\x80\x94that had been\xe2\x80\x94hard for\r\nhim to bear. \xe2\x80\x98I did not make the allowances,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98which I ought\r\nto have done, for his temper and spirits\xe2\x80\x94his delightful spirits, and\r\nthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\r\ncircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\r\nme, as they were at first.\xe2\x80\x99 She then began to speak of you, and of the\r\ngreat kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\r\nwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an\r\nopportunity, to thank you\xe2\x80\x94I could not thank you too much\xe2\x80\x94for every wish\r\nand every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had never\r\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not know her to be happy now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich,\r\nin spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\r\nmust be, I could not bear these thanks;\xe2\x80\x94for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\r\nwere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\r\nFairfax!\xe2\x80\x94Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is\r\nall to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\r\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\r\nvery good\xe2\x80\x94I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\r\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\r\nwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved\r\nhim very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with\r\na great deal of reason, and at least equal affection\xe2\x80\x94but she had too\r\nmuch to urge for Emma\xe2\x80\x99s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square\r\nor to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston\r\nended with, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you\r\nknow, but I hope it will soon come,\xe2\x80\x9d she was obliged to pause before\r\nshe answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could\r\nat all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you well, my Emma?\xe2\x80\x9d was Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s parting question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\r\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s communications furnished Emma with more food for\r\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\r\nsense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\r\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\r\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\r\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s known wishes, in paying that attention\r\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\r\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to\r\nfind a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\r\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x94Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\r\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nwas she?\xe2\x80\x94Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\r\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s confidence on this\r\nimportant matter\xe2\x80\x94which was most probable\xe2\x80\x94still, in knowing her as she\r\nought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\r\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\r\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\r\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\r\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, by the\r\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s. Of all the sources of evil\r\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\r\nthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\r\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\r\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s peace in a thousand instances; and on\r\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\r\nThe weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,\r\nand nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the\r\nwind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such\r\ncruel sights the longer visible.\r\n\r\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\r\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s side, and\r\nby exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\r\nher of their first forlorn t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate, on the evening of Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and\r\ndissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\r\nHartfield\xe2\x80\x99s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\r\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\r\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\r\nno pleasures had been lost.\xe2\x80\x94But her present forebodings she feared\r\nwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\r\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nmight not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might\r\ntake place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\r\ncomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\r\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\r\n\r\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\r\nherself; and Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s heart and time would be occupied by it. They\r\nshould lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\r\nalso.\xe2\x80\x94Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\r\nFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\r\nHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near\r\nEnscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these\r\nlosses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of\r\ncheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be\r\nno longer coming there for his evening comfort!\xe2\x80\x94No longer walking in at\r\nall hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x94How\r\nwas it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsociety all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the\r\nfirst, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the\r\nbest blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that\r\nit had been all her own work?\r\n\r\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\r\na start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few\r\nseconds\xe2\x80\x94and the only source whence any thing like consolation or\r\ncomposure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\r\nconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\r\nbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\r\nwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\r\nleave her less to regret when it were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the\r\nsame loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\r\nHartfield\xe2\x80\x94but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\r\nsofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\r\nsummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,\r\nEmma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the\r\nexquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and\r\nbrilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for\r\nthe serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\nin soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she\r\nlost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.\xe2\x80\x94There, with spirits\r\nfreshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,\r\nwhen she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\r\ntowards her.\xe2\x80\x94It was the first intimation of his being returned from\r\nLondon. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as\r\nunquestionably sixteen miles distant.\xe2\x80\x94There was time only for the\r\nquickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a\r\nminute they were together. The \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d were quiet and\r\nconstrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; they\r\nwere all well.\xe2\x80\x94When had he left them?\xe2\x80\x94Only that morning. He must have\r\nhad a wet ride.\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\xe2\x80\x94He meant to walk with her, she found. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had just\r\nlooked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred\r\nbeing out of doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She thought he neither looked nor spoke\r\ncheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her\r\nfears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his\r\nbrother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.\r\n\r\nThey walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\r\nat her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\r\ngive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\r\nspeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\r\nencouragement to begin.\xe2\x80\x94She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\r\nway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not\r\nbear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\r\nconsidered\xe2\x80\x94resolved\xe2\x80\x94and, trying to smile, began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\r\nsurprize you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I?\xe2\x80\x9d said he quietly, and looking at her; \xe2\x80\x9cof what nature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the best nature in the world\xe2\x80\x94a wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\r\nhe replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\r\nhim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\r\nat Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s in his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\r\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\r\ncomposure,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\r\nhad your suspicions.\xe2\x80\x94I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\r\nme a caution.\xe2\x80\x94I wish I had attended to it\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94(with a sinking voice and\r\na heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of\r\nhaving excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn\r\nwithin his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,\r\nin a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.\xe2\x80\x94Your own excellent\r\nsense\xe2\x80\x94your exertions for your father\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94I know you will not allow\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken\r\nand subdued accent, \xe2\x80\x9cThe feelings of the warmest\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94Indignation\xe2\x80\x94Abominable scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And in a louder, steadier\r\ntone, he concluded with, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will soon be gone. They will soon be in\r\nYorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\r\nof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind\xe2\x80\x94but you are mistaken\xe2\x80\x94and I must set you right.\xe2\x80\x94 I am\r\nnot in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going\r\non, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of,\r\nand I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\r\nwell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\r\nto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, looking eagerly at her, \xe2\x80\x9care you, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nchecking himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I understand you\xe2\x80\x94forgive me\xe2\x80\x94I am pleased that\r\nyou can say even so much.\xe2\x80\x94He is no object of regret, indeed! and it\r\nwill not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\r\nof more than your reason.\xe2\x80\x94Fortunate that your affections were not\r\nfarther entangled!\xe2\x80\x94I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\r\nmyself as to the degree of what you felt\xe2\x80\x94I could only be certain that\r\nthere was a preference\xe2\x80\x94and a preference which I never believed him to\r\ndeserve.\xe2\x80\x94He is a disgrace to the name of man.\xe2\x80\x94And is he to be rewarded\r\nwith that sweet young woman?\xe2\x80\x94Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\r\ncreature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Knightley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\r\nerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\r\nhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\r\nat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be\r\nnatural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.\xe2\x80\x94But I\r\nnever have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\r\nnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\r\nclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself\r\nin his opinion. She went on, however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very little to say for my own conduct.\xe2\x80\x94I was tempted by his\r\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.\xe2\x80\x94An old story,\r\nprobably\xe2\x80\x94a common case\xe2\x80\x94and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\r\nsex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\r\nas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\r\nHe was the son of Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x94he was continually here\xe2\x80\x94I always found him\r\nvery pleasant\xe2\x80\x94and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\r\ncauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last\xe2\x80\x94my vanity\r\nwas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however\xe2\x80\x94for some\r\ntime, indeed\xe2\x80\x94I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.\xe2\x80\x94I thought\r\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\r\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\r\nattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\r\nnever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\r\nsituation with another.\xe2\x80\x94It was his object to blind all about him; and\r\nno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself\xe2\x80\x94except\r\nthat I was _not_ blinded\xe2\x80\x94that it was my good fortune\xe2\x80\x94that, in short, I\r\nwas somehow or other safe from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had hoped for an answer here\xe2\x80\x94for a few words to say that her\r\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as\r\nshe could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual\r\ntone, he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.\xe2\x80\x94I can suppose,\r\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\r\nbeen but trifling.\xe2\x80\x94And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\r\nmay yet turn out well.\xe2\x80\x94With such a woman he has a chance.\xe2\x80\x94I have no\r\nmotive for wishing him ill\xe2\x80\x94and for her sake, whose happiness will be\r\ninvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of their being happy together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\nthem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a most fortunate man!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nearly in life\xe2\x80\x94at three-and-twenty\xe2\x80\x94a period when, if a man chuses a\r\nwife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a\r\nprize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has\r\nbefore him!\xe2\x80\x94Assured of the love of such a woman\xe2\x80\x94the disinterested love,\r\nfor Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every\r\nthing in his favour,\xe2\x80\x94equality of situation\xe2\x80\x94I mean, as far as regards\r\nsociety, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in\r\nevery point but one\xe2\x80\x94and that one, since the purity of her heart is not\r\nto be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his\r\nto bestow the only advantages she wants.\xe2\x80\x94A man would always wish to\r\ngive a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who\r\ncan do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be\r\nthe happiest of mortals.\xe2\x80\x94Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of\r\nfortune. Every thing turns out for his good.\xe2\x80\x94He meets with a young\r\nwoman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\r\nby negligent treatment\xe2\x80\x94and had he and all his family sought round the\r\nworld for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her\r\nsuperior.\xe2\x80\x94His aunt is in the way.\xe2\x80\x94His aunt dies.\xe2\x80\x94He has only to\r\nspeak.\xe2\x80\x94His friends are eager to promote his happiness.\xe2\x80\x94He had used\r\nevery body ill\xe2\x80\x94and they are all delighted to forgive him.\xe2\x80\x94He is a\r\nfortunate man indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if you envied him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of\r\nHarriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\r\npossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\r\ndifferent\xe2\x80\x94the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\r\nbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not ask me what is the point of envy.\xe2\x80\x94You are determined, I\r\nsee, to have no curiosity.\xe2\x80\x94You are wise\xe2\x80\x94but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma, I\r\nmust tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\r\nnext moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! then, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak it, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak it,\xe2\x80\x9d she eagerly cried. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a\r\nlittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\r\nanother syllable followed.\r\n\r\nEmma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to consult her;\xe2\x80\x94cost her what it would, she would listen.\r\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\r\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own\r\nindependence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be\r\nmore intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.\xe2\x80\x94They had\r\nreached the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going in, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94replied Emma\xe2\x80\x94quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he\r\nstill spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x9d And, after proceeding a few steps, she added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI stopped you\r\nungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\r\npain.\xe2\x80\x94But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to\r\nask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation\xe2\x80\x94as a\r\nfriend, indeed, you may command me.\xe2\x80\x94I will hear whatever you like. I\r\nwill tell you exactly what I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94repeated Mr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEmma, that I fear is a word\xe2\x80\x94No,\r\nI have no wish\xe2\x80\x94Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?\xe2\x80\x94I have gone too far\r\nalready for concealment.\xe2\x80\x94Emma, I accept your offer\xe2\x80\x94Extraordinary as it\r\nmay seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.\xe2\x80\x94Tell me,\r\nthen, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\r\nof his eyes overpowered her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Emma,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor dearest you will always be, whatever\r\nthe event of this hour\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, my dearest, most beloved\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x94tell me at once. Say \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 if it is to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She could really\r\nsay nothing.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou are silent,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with great animation;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\r\ndread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\r\nprominent feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot make speeches, Emma:\xe2\x80\x9d he soon resumed; and in a tone of such\r\nsincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\r\nconvincing.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\r\nmore. But you know what I am.\xe2\x80\x94You hear nothing but truth from me.\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\r\nwoman in England would have borne it.\xe2\x80\x94Bear with the truths I would tell\r\nyou now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner,\r\nperhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a\r\nvery indifferent lover.\xe2\x80\x94But you understand me.\xe2\x80\x94Yes, you see, you\r\nunderstand my feelings\xe2\x80\x94and will return them if you can. At present, I\r\nask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Emma\xe2\x80\x99s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\r\nvelocity of thought, had been able\xe2\x80\x94and yet without losing a word\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as\r\ncomplete a delusion as any of her own\xe2\x80\x94that Harriet was nothing; that\r\nshe was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to\r\nHarriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and\r\nthat her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had\r\nbeen all received as discouragement from herself.\xe2\x80\x94And not only was\r\nthere time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant\r\nhappiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s secret had not\r\nescaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.\xe2\x80\x94It was\r\nall the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of\r\nthat heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him\r\nto transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the\r\nmost worthy of the two\xe2\x80\x94or even the more simple sublimity of resolving\r\nto refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive,\r\nbecause he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for\r\nHarriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run\r\nmad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her\r\nbrain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her\r\nfor ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong\r\nas it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him,\r\nas most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite\r\nsmooth.\xe2\x80\x94She spoke then, on being so entreated.\xe2\x80\x94What did she say?\xe2\x80\x94Just\r\nwhat she ought, of course. A lady always does.\xe2\x80\x94She said enough to shew\r\nthere need not be despair\xe2\x80\x94and to invite him to say more himself. He\r\n_had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to\r\ncaution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;\xe2\x80\x94she had begun\r\nby refusing to hear him.\xe2\x80\x94The change had perhaps been somewhat\r\nsudden;\xe2\x80\x94her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the\r\nconversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little\r\nextraordinary!\xe2\x80\x94She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so\r\nobliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.\r\n\r\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human\r\ndisclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little\r\ndisguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the\r\nconduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very\r\nmaterial.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart\r\nthan she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\r\n\r\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\r\nfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\r\nin his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s engagement, with\r\nno selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed\r\nhim an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.\xe2\x80\x94The rest had been the work\r\nof the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings.\r\nThe delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank\r\nChurchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had\r\ngiven birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection\r\nhimself;\xe2\x80\x94but it had been no present hope\xe2\x80\x94he had only, in the momentary\r\nconquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did\r\nnot forbid his attempt to attach her.\xe2\x80\x94The superior hopes which\r\ngradually opened were so much the more enchanting.\xe2\x80\x94The affection, which\r\nhe had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already\r\nhis!\xe2\x80\x94Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed\r\nstate of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could\r\nbear no other name.\r\n\r\n_Her_ change was equal.\xe2\x80\x94This one half-hour had given to each the same\r\nprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\r\ndegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.\xe2\x80\x94On his side, there had been\r\na long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\r\nof Frank Churchill.\xe2\x80\x94He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\r\nChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\r\nenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\r\nthat had taken him from the country.\xe2\x80\x94The Box Hill party had decided him\r\non going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such\r\npermitted, encouraged attentions.\xe2\x80\x94He had gone to learn to be\r\nindifferent.\xe2\x80\x94But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\r\ndomestic happiness in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house; woman wore too amiable a\r\nform in it; Isabella was too much like Emma\xe2\x80\x94differing only in those\r\nstriking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy\r\nbefore him, for much to have been done, even had his time been\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x94He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day\xe2\x80\x94till this\r\nvery morning\xe2\x80\x99s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94Then,\r\nwith the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to\r\nfeel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving\r\nEmma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\r\nthat he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and\r\nhad walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best\r\nof all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nHe had found her agitated and low.\xe2\x80\x94Frank Churchill was a villain.\xe2\x80\x94 He\r\nheard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter was not desperate.\xe2\x80\x94She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\r\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of\r\nFrank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\r\nwhat she had brought out!\xe2\x80\x94she had then been only daring to hope for a\r\nlittle respite of suffering;\xe2\x80\x94she was now in an exquisite flutter of\r\nhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\r\ngreater when the flutter should have passed away.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to tea\xe2\x80\x94the same party round the same table\xe2\x80\x94how often it\r\nhad been collected!\xe2\x80\x94and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\r\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\r\nwestern sun!\xe2\x80\x94But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\r\nlike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\r\nusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in\r\nthe breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\r\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.\xe2\x80\x94Could he have\r\nseen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but\r\nwithout the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the\r\nslightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of\r\neither, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news\r\nhe had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much\r\nself-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him\r\nin return.\r\n\r\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma\xe2\x80\x99s fever continued;\r\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\r\nsubdued\xe2\x80\x94and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for\r\nsuch an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to\r\nconsider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\r\nalloy. Her father\xe2\x80\x94and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\r\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\r\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it\r\nwas a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\r\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\r\nsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.\xe2\x80\x94She even wept over the\r\nidea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\r\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger\r\nof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.\xe2\x80\x94How\r\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;\xe2\x80\x94how to spare\r\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\r\nhow to appear least her enemy?\xe2\x80\x94On these subjects, her perplexity and\r\ndistress were very great\xe2\x80\x94and her mind had to pass again and again\r\nthrough every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\r\nsurrounded it.\xe2\x80\x94She could only resolve at last, that she would still\r\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\r\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\r\njust now for a time from Highbury, and\xe2\x80\x94indulging in one scheme\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\r\nfor her to Brunswick Square.\xe2\x80\x94Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\r\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.\xe2\x80\x94She did\r\nnot think it in Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s nature to escape being benefited by novelty\r\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.\xe2\x80\x94At any rate,\r\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\r\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\r\nevil day, when they must all be together again.\r\n\r\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\r\nleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\r\nup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\r\nan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\r\nliterally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\r\nproper share of the happiness of the evening before.\r\n\r\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\r\nslightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\r\nbrought her from Randalls\xe2\x80\x94a very thick letter;\xe2\x80\x94she guessed what it must\r\ncontain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.\xe2\x80\x94She was now in\r\nperfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\r\nwanted only to have her thoughts to herself\xe2\x80\x94and as for understanding\r\nany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.\xe2\x80\x94It must be\r\nwaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nnote from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\r\nMrs. Weston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\r\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have\r\nscarcely a doubt of its happy effect.\xe2\x80\x94I think we shall never materially\r\ndisagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long\r\npreface.\xe2\x80\x94We are quite well.\xe2\x80\x94This letter has been the cure of all the\r\nlittle nervousness I have been feeling lately.\xe2\x80\x94I did not quite like\r\nyour looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you\r\nwill never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a\r\nnorth-east wind.\xe2\x80\x94I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of\r\nTuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing\r\nlast night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours ever,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. W.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[_To Mrs. Weston_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWindsor\xe2\x80\x94July.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;\r\nbut expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\r\nindulgence.\xe2\x80\x94You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\r\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\r\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\r\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\r\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\r\nand of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.\xe2\x80\x94You\r\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when\r\nI first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret\r\nwhich was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to\r\nplace myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another\r\nquestion. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it\r\na right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,\r\nand casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\r\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\r\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\r\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\r\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.\xe2\x80\x94Had she refused, I\r\nshould have gone mad.\xe2\x80\x94But you will be ready to say, what was your hope\r\nin doing this?\xe2\x80\x94What did you look forward to?\xe2\x80\x94To any thing, every\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\r\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\r\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining\r\nher promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther\r\nexplanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good,\r\nwhich no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x94See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit\r\nto Randalls;\xe2\x80\x94and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might\r\nhave been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come\r\ntill Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person\r\nslighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from\r\nhis house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour,\r\nduring the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I\r\nhope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I\r\ncome to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while\r\nbelonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very\r\nsolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest\r\nfriendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I\r\nought to add, with the deepest humiliation.\xe2\x80\x94A few words which dropped\r\nfrom him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge\r\nmyself liable to.\xe2\x80\x94My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,\r\nmore than it ought.\xe2\x80\x94In order to assist a concealment so essential to\r\nme, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of\r\nintimacy into which we were immediately thrown.\xe2\x80\x94I cannot deny that Miss\r\nWoodhouse was my ostensible object\xe2\x80\x94but I am sure you will believe the\r\ndeclaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would\r\nnot have been induced by any selfish views to go on.\xe2\x80\x94Amiable and\r\ndelightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young\r\nwoman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any\r\ntendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x94She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured\r\nplayfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each\r\nother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and\r\nwere felt to be so.\xe2\x80\x94Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand\r\nme before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;\xe2\x80\x94when I called\r\nto take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of\r\nconfessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;\r\nbut I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some\r\ndegree.\xe2\x80\x94She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\r\nhave penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the\r\nsubject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take\r\nher wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember\r\nher telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her\r\nattentions to Miss Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94I hope this history of my conduct towards\r\nher will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what\r\nyou saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\r\nWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\r\nprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of\r\nthat said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\r\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x94Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\r\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\r\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\r\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.\xe2\x80\x94Of\r\nthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\r\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F\xe2\x80\x94, who would never\r\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.\xe2\x80\x94The delicacy\r\nof her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much\r\nbeyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope,\r\nknow her thoroughly yourself.\xe2\x80\x94No description can describe her. She must\r\ntell you herself what she is\xe2\x80\x94yet not by word, for never was there a\r\nhuman creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.\xe2\x80\x94Since I\r\nbegan this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard\r\nfrom her.\xe2\x80\x94She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never\r\ncomplains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks.\r\nI know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\r\nPerhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am\r\nimpatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at\r\nRandalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much\r\nbetter yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I think\r\nof the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and\r\npatience, and my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I\r\nrecollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve\r\nto be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nI must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to\r\nencroach.\xe2\x80\x94I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\r\nthat you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\r\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\r\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the\r\nevent of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me\r\nthe happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early\r\nmeasures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not\r\nan hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,\r\nand she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength\r\nand refinement.\xe2\x80\x94But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had\r\nentered into with that woman\xe2\x80\x94Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to\r\nleave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.\xe2\x80\x94I have been\r\nwalking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make\r\nthe rest of my letter what it ought to be.\xe2\x80\x94It is, in fact, a most\r\nmortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can\r\nadmit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were\r\nhighly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x94My plea of concealing the truth she did not think\r\nsufficient.\xe2\x80\x94She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought\r\nher, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I\r\nthought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her\r\njudgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed\r\nproper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever\r\nknown.\xe2\x80\x94We quarrelled.\xe2\x80\x94 Do you remember the morning spent at\r\nDonwell?\xe2\x80\x94_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before\r\ncame to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and\r\nwanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely\r\nrefused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now,\r\nhowever, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree\r\nof discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was\r\nbehaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,\r\nwas she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\r\nevery previous caution useless?\xe2\x80\x94Had we been met walking together\r\nbetween Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nmad enough, however, to resent.\xe2\x80\x94I doubted her affection. I doubted it\r\nmore the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my\r\nside, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent\r\ndevotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of\r\nsense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly\r\nintelligible to me.\xe2\x80\x94In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless\r\non her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to\r\nRichmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning,\r\nmerely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I\r\nwas not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was\r\nthe injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined\r\nthat she should make the first advances.\xe2\x80\x94I shall always congratulate\r\nmyself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\r\nbehaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well\r\nof me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it\r\nproduced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she\r\nclosed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of\r\nwhose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation\r\nand hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has\r\nbeen so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\r\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Jane,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x94You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling\r\nher by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in\r\nhearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of\r\nneedless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.\r\nHave patience with me, I shall soon have done.\xe2\x80\x94She closed with this\r\noffer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to\r\ntell me that we never were to meet again.\xe2\x80\x94_She_ _felt_ _the_\r\n_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\r\n_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.\xe2\x80\x94This letter reached me on the very\r\nmorning of my poor aunt\xe2\x80\x99s death. I answered it within an hour; but from\r\nthe confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on\r\nme at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other\r\nletters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting\r\nthat I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,\r\nremained without any uneasiness.\xe2\x80\x94I was rather disappointed that I did\r\nnot hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was\r\ntoo busy, and\xe2\x80\x94may I add?\xe2\x80\x94too cheerful in my views to be captious.\xe2\x80\x94We\r\nremoved to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from\r\nher, my own letters all returned!\xe2\x80\x94and a few lines at the same time by\r\nthe post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest\r\nreply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\r\nnot be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to\r\nhave every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she\r\nnow sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that\r\nif I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury\r\nwithin a week, I would forward them after that period to her at\xe2\x80\x94: in\r\nshort, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge\xe2\x80\x99s, near Bristol, stared me\r\nin the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and\r\ninstantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with\r\nthat resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the\r\nsecrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,\r\nwas equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would\r\nnot she have seemed to threaten me.\xe2\x80\x94Imagine the shock; imagine how,\r\ntill I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of\r\nthe post.\xe2\x80\x94What was to be done?\xe2\x80\x94One thing only.\xe2\x80\x94I must speak to my\r\nuncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nspoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\r\naway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\r\nwholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with\r\na deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the\r\nmarriage state as he had done.\xe2\x80\x94I felt that it would be of a different\r\nsort.\xe2\x80\x94Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in\r\nopening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?\xe2\x80\x94No;\r\ndo not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.\r\nDo not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.\xe2\x80\x94I reached Highbury at\r\nthe time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I\r\nwas certain of a good chance of finding her alone.\xe2\x80\x94I was not\r\ndisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object\r\nof my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I\r\nhad to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much\r\ndearer, than ever, and no moment\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness can ever occur between us\r\nagain. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude\r\nbefore. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\r\never shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will\r\ndictate towards her.\xe2\x80\x94If you think me in a way to be happier than I\r\ndeserve, I am quite of your opinion.\xe2\x80\x94Miss W. calls me the child of good\r\nfortune. I hope she is right.\xe2\x80\x94In one respect, my good fortune is\r\nundoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,\r\n\r\nYour obliged and affectionate Son,\r\n\r\nF. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter must make its way to Emma\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. She was obliged, in\r\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\r\njustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\r\nit was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\r\nand almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the\r\nsubject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her\r\nformer regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any\r\npicture of love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till\r\nshe had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to\r\nfeel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had\r\nsupposed\xe2\x80\x94and he had suffered, and was very sorry\xe2\x80\x94and he was so grateful\r\nto Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so\r\nhappy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have\r\nentered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as\r\never.\r\n\r\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\r\nshe desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s wishing it to\r\nbe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen\r\nso much to blame in his conduct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very glad to look it over,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems long. I\r\nwill take it home with me at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\r\nmust return it by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather be talking to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as it seems a\r\nmatter of justice, it shall be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began\xe2\x80\x94stopping, however, almost directly to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHad I been offered\r\nthe sight of one of this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s letters to his mother-in-law a few\r\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\r\nsmile, observed, \xe2\x80\x9cHumph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\r\nway. One man\xe2\x80\x99s style must not be the rule of another\xe2\x80\x99s. We will not be\r\nsevere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be natural for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added shortly afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cto speak my\r\nopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\r\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I should wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe trifles here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cas to the temptation. He knows he is\r\nwrong, and has nothing rational to urge.\xe2\x80\x94Bad.\xe2\x80\x94He ought not to have\r\nformed the engagement.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98His father\xe2\x80\x99s disposition:\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94he is unjust,\r\nhowever, to his father. Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s sanguine temper was a blessing on\r\nall his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every\r\npresent comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.\xe2\x80\x94Very true; he did not\r\ncome till Miss Fairfax was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have not forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma, \xe2\x80\x9chow sure you were that he might\r\nhave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely\xe2\x80\x94but you\r\nwere perfectly right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:\xe2\x80\x94but yet, I think\xe2\x80\x94had\r\n_you_ not been in the case\xe2\x80\x94I should still have distrusted him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\r\naloud\xe2\x80\x94all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\r\nhead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\r\nthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\r\nreflection, thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery bad\xe2\x80\x94though it might have been worse.\xe2\x80\x94Playing a most dangerous\r\ngame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.\xe2\x80\x94No judge of his\r\nown manners by you.\xe2\x80\x94Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\r\nregardless of little besides his own convenience.\xe2\x80\x94Fancying you to have\r\nfathomed his secret. Natural enough!\xe2\x80\x94his own mind full of intrigue,\r\nthat he should suspect it in others.\xe2\x80\x94Mystery; Finesse\xe2\x80\x94how they pervert\r\nthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\r\nand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with\r\neach other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pianoforte! Ah! That\r\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider\r\nwhether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the\r\npleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!\xe2\x80\x94I cannot comprehend a man\xe2\x80\x99s wishing\r\nto give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather\r\ndispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the\r\ninstrument\xe2\x80\x99s coming if she could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\r\nmore than a word in passing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perfectly agree with you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was then his remark. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did behave\r\nvery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.\xe2\x80\x9d And having gone through\r\nwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\r\npersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s sense of\r\nright, he made a fuller pause to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is very bad.\xe2\x80\x94He had induced\r\nher to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme\r\ndifficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to\r\nprevent her from suffering unnecessarily.\xe2\x80\x94She must have had much more\r\nto contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He\r\nshould have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;\r\nbut hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and\r\nremember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the\r\nengagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of\r\npunishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\r\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\r\ndeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\r\nhowever, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\r\nexcepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\r\nof giving pain\xe2\x80\x94no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\r\nEltons,\xe2\x80\x9d was his next observation.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHis feelings are natural.\xe2\x80\x94What!\r\nactually resolve to break with him entirely!\xe2\x80\x94She felt the engagement to\r\nbe a source of repentance and misery to each\xe2\x80\x94she dissolved it.\xe2\x80\x94What a\r\nview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!\xe2\x80\x94Well, he must be a most\r\nextraordinary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay, read on.\xe2\x80\x94You will find how very much he suffers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he does,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the\r\nletter. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Smallridge!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94What does this mean? What is all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndear friend of Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\r\nbye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read\xe2\x80\x94not even of\r\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\r\nthe man writes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there _is_ feeling here.\xe2\x80\x94He does seem to have suffered in\r\nfinding her ill.\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x98Dearer, much dearer than ever.\xe2\x80\x99 I hope he may long continue to\r\nfeel all the value of such a reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x94He is a very liberal\r\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Happier than I\r\ndeserve.\xe2\x80\x99 Come, he knows himself there. \xe2\x80\x98Miss Woodhouse calls me the\r\nchild of good fortune.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Those were Miss Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s words, were they?\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAnd a fine ending\xe2\x80\x94and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\r\nThat was your name for him, was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\r\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\r\nhope it does him some service with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\r\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\r\nin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\r\nis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\r\nmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am\r\nvery ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers\r\nthe steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me\r\ntalk to you of something else. I have another person\xe2\x80\x99s interest at\r\npresent so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank\r\nChurchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been\r\nhard at work on one subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\r\nEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\r\nwith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\r\nhappiness of her father. Emma\xe2\x80\x99s answer was ready at the first word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile her dear father lived, any change of condition must be\r\nimpossible for her. She could never quit him.\xe2\x80\x9d Part only of this\r\nanswer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her\r\nfather, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the\r\ninadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been\r\nthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to\r\ninduce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to\r\nbelieve it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not\r\nsuffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his\r\npersuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.\r\nWoodhouse taken from Hartfield!\xe2\x80\x94No, he felt that it ought not to be\r\nattempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he\r\ntrusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\r\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s happiness\xe2\x80\x94in other words, his life\xe2\x80\x94required Hartfield to\r\ncontinue her home, it should be his likewise.\r\n\r\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\r\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\r\nan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\r\nthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\r\nbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\r\nin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\r\nwould be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of\r\nit, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced,\r\nthat no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the\r\nsubject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm\r\nconsideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole\r\nmorning, to have his thoughts to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure\r\nWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\r\nask mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\r\nmoreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\r\nwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck\r\nwith any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\r\nheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she\r\nmust of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she\r\nonly gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement\r\nin detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\r\nwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\r\n\r\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\r\nHartfield\xe2\x80\x94the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\r\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their\r\nmutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in\r\nthe periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!\xe2\x80\x94Such a partner in\r\nall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\r\nmelancholy!\r\n\r\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\r\nof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\r\nwho must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\r\nparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\r\ncharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\r\nevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\r\nfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead\r\nweight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\r\npeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state\r\nof unmerited punishment.\r\n\r\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\r\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\r\nKnightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;\xe2\x80\x94not like\r\nMr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\r\nconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\r\nthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\r\ncould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\r\nherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\r\nletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\r\n\r\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\r\nreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\r\nwas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her\r\nstyle, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.\xe2\x80\x94It\r\nmight be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only\r\ncould have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\r\n\r\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella\xe2\x80\x99s invitation; and she was\r\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without\r\nresorting to invention.\xe2\x80\x94There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished,\r\nand had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\r\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\r\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.\xe2\x80\x94When it was thus settled on\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very\r\npersuadable.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\r\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s carriage.\xe2\x80\x94It was\r\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s visits; now she could\r\ntalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\r\nof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted\r\nher when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much\r\nmight at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the\r\nfeelings which she had led astray herself.\r\n\r\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s, or in London, made perhaps\r\nan unreasonable difference in Emma\xe2\x80\x99s sensations; but she could not\r\nthink of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\r\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\r\n\r\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\r\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication\r\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nconfession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing\r\nto do with it at present.\xe2\x80\x94She had resolved to defer the disclosure till\r\nMrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be\r\nthrown at this period among those she loved\xe2\x80\x94and the evil should not act\r\non herself by anticipation before the appointed time.\xe2\x80\x94A fortnight, at\r\nleast, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more\r\nagitating, delight, should be hers.\r\n\r\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\r\nhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.\xe2\x80\x94She ought\r\nto go\xe2\x80\x94and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\r\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\r\n_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of\r\nprospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should\r\nattend to any thing Jane might communicate.\r\n\r\nShe went\xe2\x80\x94she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\r\nbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane\r\nhad been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all\r\nthe worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.\xe2\x80\x94The fear of being\r\nstill unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home,\r\nto wait in the passage, and send up her name.\xe2\x80\x94She heard Patty\r\nannouncing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had\r\nbefore made so happily intelligible.\xe2\x80\x94No; she heard nothing but the\r\ninstant reply of, \xe2\x80\x9cBeg her to walk up;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and a moment afterwards she was\r\nmet on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no\r\nother reception of her were felt sufficient.\xe2\x80\x94Emma had never seen her\r\nlook so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,\r\nanimation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or\r\nmanner could ever have wanted.\xe2\x80\x94 She came forward with an offered hand;\r\nand said, in a low, but very feeling tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is most kind, indeed!\xe2\x80\x94Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to\r\nexpress\xe2\x80\x94I hope you will believe\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me for being so entirely without\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\r\nsound of Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her,\r\nand made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\r\ncongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\r\naccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\r\nElton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\r\nbody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped\r\nthe rencontre would do them no harm.\r\n\r\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, and\r\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\r\nMiss Fairfax\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what\r\nwas still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately\r\nin the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to\r\nMrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady\xe2\x80\x99s replies, she\r\nsaw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which\r\nshe had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it\r\ninto the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant\r\nnods,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\r\nopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already.\r\nI only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\r\nnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\r\ncreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.\xe2\x80\x94But not a word\r\nmore. Let us be discreet\xe2\x80\x94quite on our good behaviour.\xe2\x80\x94Hush!\xe2\x80\x94You\r\nremember those lines\xe2\x80\x94I forget the poem at this moment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor when a lady\xe2\x80\x99s in the case,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know all other things give place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94mum! a word to the\r\nwise.\xe2\x80\x94I am in a fine flow of spirits, an\xe2\x80\x99t I? But I want to set your\r\nheart at ease as to Mrs. S.\xe2\x80\x94_My_ representation, you see, has quite\r\nappeased her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again, on Emma\xe2\x80\x99s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknitting, she added, in a half whisper,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mentioned no _names_, you will observe.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! no; cautious as a\r\nminister of state. I managed it extremely well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\r\npossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony\r\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed\r\nwith,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\r\ncharmingly recovered?\xe2\x80\x94Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\r\ncredit?\xe2\x80\x94(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\r\nword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! if you had\r\nseen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And when Mrs. Bates was\r\nsaying something to Emma, whispered farther, \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not say a word of\r\nany _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\r\nphysician from Windsor.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nshortly afterwards began, \xe2\x80\x9csince the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\r\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\r\nseem\xe2\x80\x94that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.\xe2\x80\x94So\r\nit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\r\nit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to\r\nour collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while\r\nthe fine weather lasts?\xe2\x80\x94It must be the same party, you know, quite the\r\nsame party, not _one_ exception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\r\ndiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\r\nshe supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\r\nevery thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.\xe2\x80\x94It is impossible\r\nto say\xe2\x80\x94Yes, indeed, I quite understand\xe2\x80\x94dearest Jane\xe2\x80\x99s prospects\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis, I do not mean.\xe2\x80\x94But she is charmingly recovered.\xe2\x80\x94How is Mr.\r\nWoodhouse?\xe2\x80\x94I am so glad.\xe2\x80\x94Quite out of my power.\xe2\x80\x94Such a happy little\r\ncircle as you find us here.\xe2\x80\x94Yes, indeed.\xe2\x80\x94Charming young man!\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nvery friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!\xe2\x80\x94such attention to Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And from\r\nher great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton\r\nfor being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of\r\nresentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now\r\ngraciously overcome.\xe2\x80\x94After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it\r\nbeyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\r\nanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\r\nis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\r\nhere, and pay his respects to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?\xe2\x80\x94That will\r\nbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits,\r\nand Mr. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s time is so engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word it is, Miss Bates.\xe2\x80\x94He really is engaged from morning to\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x94There is no end of people\xe2\x80\x99s coming to him, on some pretence or\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x94The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\r\nwanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, Mr. E.,\xe2\x80\x99 I often say, \xe2\x80\x98rather you than I.\xe2\x80\x94I do not\r\nknow what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half\r\nso many applicants.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them\r\nboth to an unpardonable degree.\xe2\x80\x94I believe I have not played a bar this\r\nfortnight.\xe2\x80\x94However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose\r\nto wait on you all.\xe2\x80\x9d And putting up her hand to screen her words from\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA congratulatory visit, you know.\xe2\x80\x94Oh! yes, quite indispensable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily\xe2\x80\x94!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from\r\nKnightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\r\nconsultation.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. E. is Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s right hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Elton\r\ngone on foot to Donwell?\xe2\x80\x94He will have a hot walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\r\nCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\r\nlead.\xe2\x80\x94I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave not you mistaken the day?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cI am almost certain that\r\nthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Knightley was at\r\nHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d was the abrupt answer, which\r\ndenoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton\xe2\x80\x99s side.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the most troublesome parish that ever\r\nwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour parish there was small,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\r\ntalked of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\r\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;\r\nthe only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you clever creature, that\xe2\x80\x99s very true. What a thinking brain you\r\nhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if\r\nwe could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would\r\nproduce perfection.\xe2\x80\x94Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that\r\n_some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.\xe2\x80\x94But hush!\xe2\x80\x94not a\r\nword, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\r\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\r\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\r\nevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\r\n\r\nMr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\r\nsparkling vivacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\r\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I\r\nshould not stir till my lord and master appeared.\xe2\x80\x94Here have I been\r\nsitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\r\nobedience\xe2\x80\x94for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\r\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\r\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and\r\nthe walk he had had for nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got to Donwell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cKnightley could not be found. Very\r\nodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and\r\nthe message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonwell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his wife.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr. E., you have not been to\r\nDonwell!\xe2\x80\x94You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\r\nto-day on that very account.\xe2\x80\x94Such a dreadful broiling morning!\xe2\x80\x94I went\r\nover the fields too\xe2\x80\x94(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\r\nit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I\r\nam not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\r\nhousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.\xe2\x80\x94Very\r\nextraordinary!\xe2\x80\x94And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to\r\nHartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!\xe2\x80\x94Can you explain it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\r\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\r\nought to do,) \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\r\nall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\r\nbe forgotten!\xe2\x80\x94My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\r\nsure he must.\xe2\x80\x94Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;\xe2\x80\x94and his\r\nservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\r\nto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often\r\nobserved, extremely awkward and remiss.\xe2\x80\x94I am sure I would not have such\r\na creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.\r\nAnd as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.\xe2\x80\x94She\r\npromised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met William Larkins,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Elton, \xe2\x80\x9cas I got near the house,\r\nand he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\r\nbelieve him.\xe2\x80\x94William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\r\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get\r\nthe speech of him. I have nothing to do with William\xe2\x80\x99s wants, but it\r\nreally is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley\r\nto-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious\r\ninconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all\r\nprobability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\r\nKnightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\r\nMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\r\n\r\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\r\nattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\r\nan opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\r\nnot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\r\nintroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\r\nhave been strictly correct.\xe2\x80\x94I feel that I should certainly have been\r\nimpertinent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\r\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\r\ncomposure\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere would have been no danger. The danger would have been\r\nof my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by\r\nexpressing an interest\xe2\x80\x94. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\r\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\r\ngreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\r\nof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\r\ndisgusted to such a degree as to\xe2\x80\x94I have not time for half that I could\r\nwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\r\nmyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately\xe2\x80\x94in short, if your\r\ncompassion does not stand my friend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma warmly, and\r\ntaking her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\r\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\r\neven\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.\xe2\x80\x94So cold and\r\nartificial!\xe2\x80\x94I had always a part to act.\xe2\x80\x94It was a life of deceit!\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nthat I must have disgusted you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\r\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\r\nquickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\r\nhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you\xe2\x80\x94just as\r\nI begin to know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\r\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma,\r\nsmiling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut, excuse me, it must be thought of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\r\nam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\r\nat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\r\ndeep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\r\nmore to wait for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you.\xe2\x80\x94This is just what I wanted to be assured of.\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\r\nif you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\r\nopen!\xe2\x80\x94Good-bye, good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\r\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\r\nknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\r\nwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\r\nany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of\r\nIsabella\xe2\x80\x99s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both\r\nfather and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as\r\nhe grew older\xe2\x80\x94and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years\r\nhence\xe2\x80\x94to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,\r\nthe freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and\r\nMrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x94no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;\r\nand it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to\r\nteach, should not have their powers in exercise again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clike La Baronne d\xe2\x80\x99Almane on La Comtesse d\xe2\x80\x99Ostalis, in Madame\r\nde Genlis\xe2\x80\x99 Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\r\nAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Knightley, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will indulge her even more than\r\nshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\r\nbe the only difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma; \xe2\x80\x9cat that rate, what will become of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing very bad.\xe2\x80\x94The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in\r\ninfancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\r\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing\r\nall my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me\r\nto be severe on them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma laughed, and replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had the assistance of all your\r\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt\r\nwhether my own sense would have corrected me without it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x94I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:\xe2\x80\x94Miss Taylor\r\ngave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\r\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\r\nright has he to lecture me?\xe2\x80\x94and I am afraid very natural for you to\r\nfeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\r\nyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of\r\nthe tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much\r\nwithout doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many\r\nerrors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at\r\nleast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you were of use to me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma. \xe2\x80\x9cI was very often\r\ninfluenced rightly by you\xe2\x80\x94oftener than I would own at the time. I am\r\nvery sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\r\nspoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\r\nas you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\r\nthirteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\r\nsaucy looks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\r\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s leave\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94something which, you knew, I did\r\nnot approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\r\nfeelings instead of one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an amiable creature I was!\xe2\x80\x94No wonder you should hold my speeches\r\nin such affectionate remembrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94You always called me, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Knightley;\xe2\x80\x99 and, from\r\nhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.\xe2\x80\x94And yet it is formal. I want\r\nyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember once calling you \xe2\x80\x98George,\xe2\x80\x99 in one of my amiable fits, about\r\nten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\r\nyou made no objection, I never did it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd cannot you call me \xe2\x80\x98George\xe2\x80\x99 now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x94I never can call you any thing but \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x99 I will\r\nnot promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\r\ncalling you Mr. K.\xe2\x80\x94But I will promise,\xe2\x80\x9d she added presently, laughing\r\nand blushing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I\r\ndo not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;\xe2\x80\x94in the building in\r\nwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\r\nservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice\r\nwhich would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\r\nfollies\xe2\x80\x94her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x94She could not enter on it.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet was very seldom mentioned\r\nbetween them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not\r\nbeing thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to\r\ndelicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship\r\nwere declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\r\ncircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\r\nher intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\r\nIsabella\xe2\x80\x99s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\r\nobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior\r\nto the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\r\n\r\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\r\nexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\r\nwhich appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be\r\nconsulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear\r\nto find Harriet different from what she had known her before.\xe2\x80\x94Isabella,\r\nto be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been\r\nequal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her.\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least.\r\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was\r\ninvited to remain till they could bring her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn does not even mention your friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Knightley. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is\r\nhis answer, if you like to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\r\naccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to\r\nknow what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that\r\nher friend was unmentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn enters like a brother into my happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr.\r\nKnightley, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to\r\nhave, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from\r\nmaking flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\r\ncool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe writes like a sensible man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma, when she had read the\r\nletter. \xe2\x80\x9cI honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\r\ngood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\r\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\r\nyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\r\nconstruction, I should not have believed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Emma, he means no such thing. He only means\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmuch less, perhaps, than\r\nhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma, my dear Emma\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with more thorough gaiety, \xe2\x80\x9cif you fancy your brother\r\ndoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\r\nand hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from\r\ndoing _you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the\r\nadvantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish\r\nI may not sink into \xe2\x80\x98poor Emma\xe2\x80\x99 with him at once.\xe2\x80\x94His tender compassion\r\ntowards oppressed worth can go no farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish your father might be half as easily convinced\r\nas John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\r\nto be happy together. I am amused by one part of John\xe2\x80\x99s letter\xe2\x80\x94did you\r\nnotice it?\xe2\x80\x94where he says, that my information did not take him wholly\r\nby surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of\r\nthe kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some\r\nthoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\r\nunprepared for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\r\nfeelings. What has he been judging by?\xe2\x80\x94I am not conscious of any\r\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this\r\ntime for my marrying any more than at another.\xe2\x80\x94But it was so, I\r\nsuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\r\nthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\r\nas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, \xe2\x80\x98Uncle seems\r\nalways tired now.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\r\npersons\xe2\x80\x99 reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\r\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s visits, Emma having it in view that\r\nher gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first\r\nto announce it at home, and then at Randalls.\xe2\x80\x94But how to break it to\r\nher father at last!\xe2\x80\x94She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of\r\nMr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would\r\nhave failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to\r\ncome at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.\xe2\x80\x94She\r\nwas forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it\r\na more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\r\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.\xe2\x80\x94With all the spirits she\r\ncould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\r\nin a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\r\nobtained\xe2\x80\x94which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\r\nsince it was a plan to promote the happiness of all\xe2\x80\x94she and Mr.\r\nKnightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\r\nconstant addition of that person\xe2\x80\x99s company whom she knew he loved, next\r\nto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\r\n\r\nPoor man!\xe2\x80\x94it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\r\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\r\nhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\r\na great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor\r\nIsabella, and poor Miss Taylor.\xe2\x80\x94But it would not do. Emma hung about\r\nhim affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he\r\nmust not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\r\ntaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but\r\nshe was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was\r\nintroducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the\r\nbetter; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier\r\nfor having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to\r\nthe idea.\xe2\x80\x94Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?\xe2\x80\x94He would not deny\r\nthat he did, she was sure.\xe2\x80\x94Whom did he ever want to consult on business\r\nbut Mr. Knightley?\xe2\x80\x94Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his\r\nletters, who so glad to assist him?\xe2\x80\x94Who so cheerful, so attentive, so\r\nattached to him?\xe2\x80\x94Would not he like to have him always on the spot?\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\nThat was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he\r\nshould be glad to see him every day;\xe2\x80\x94but they did see him every day as\r\nit was.\xe2\x80\x94Why could not they go on as they had done?\r\n\r\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\r\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.\xe2\x80\x94To\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s, whose fond\r\npraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\r\nused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.\xe2\x80\x94They had all the\r\nassistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\r\napprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\r\nconsider the subject in the most serviceable light\xe2\x80\x94first, as a settled,\r\nand, secondly, as a good one\xe2\x80\x94well aware of the nearly equal importance\r\nof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x94It was agreed upon,\r\nas what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided\r\nassuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\r\nfeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\r\ntime or other\xe2\x80\x94in another year or two, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94it might not be so very\r\nbad if the marriage did take place.\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\r\nsaid to him in favour of the event.\xe2\x80\x94She had been extremely surprized,\r\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\r\nsaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\r\nurging him to the utmost.\xe2\x80\x94She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\r\nto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\r\nso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\r\nrespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\r\nso singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\r\nhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\r\nbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\r\nlong ago.\xe2\x80\x94How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\r\nwould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\r\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an\r\narrangement desirable!\xe2\x80\x94The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\r\nWoodhouse had been always felt in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s plans and her own, for\r\na marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\r\nand Hartfield had been a continual impediment\xe2\x80\x94less acknowledged by Mr.\r\nWeston than by herself\xe2\x80\x94but even he had never been able to finish the\r\nsubject better than by saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThose matters will take care of\r\nthemselves; the young people will find a way.\xe2\x80\x9d But here there was\r\nnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\r\nall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the\r\nname. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and\r\nwithout one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\r\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing\r\ncould increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon\r\nhave outgrown its first set of caps.\r\n\r\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\r\nhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\r\nfamiliarise the idea to his quickness of mind.\xe2\x80\x94He saw the advantages of\r\nthe match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but\r\nthe wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\r\nwas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be a secret, I conclude,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThese matters are always\r\na secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me\r\nbe told when I may speak out.\xe2\x80\x94I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\r\npoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\r\ndaughter?\xe2\x80\x94he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of\r\ncourse, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\r\nafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\r\nhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon\r\nit would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the\r\nevening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\r\n\r\nIn general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,\r\nand others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend\r\ntheir all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John\r\nKnightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their\r\nservants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection\r\nraised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.\xe2\x80\x94There, the surprize was\r\nnot softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,\r\ncompared with his wife; he only hoped \xe2\x80\x9cthe young lady\xe2\x80\x99s pride would now\r\nbe contented;\xe2\x80\x9d and supposed \xe2\x80\x9cshe had always meant to catch Knightley if\r\nshe could;\xe2\x80\x9d and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly\r\nexclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cRather he than I!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Knightley! poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x94sad business for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She was\r\nextremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\r\nqualities.\xe2\x80\x94How could he be so taken in?\xe2\x80\x94Did not think him at all in\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94not in the least.\xe2\x80\x94Poor Knightley!\xe2\x80\x94There would be an end of all\r\npleasant intercourse with him.\xe2\x80\x94How happy he had been to come and dine\r\nwith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.\xe2\x80\x94Poor\r\nfellow!\xe2\x80\x94No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh! no;\r\nthere would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x94Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that she\r\nhad abused the housekeeper the other day.\xe2\x80\x94Shocking plan, living\r\ntogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who had\r\ntried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\r\nbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\r\nmorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her,\r\nwhen Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After\r\nthe first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone,\r\nbegan with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood or bad?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know which it ought to be called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! good I am sure.\xe2\x80\x94I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\r\nto smile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, composing his features, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very much afraid,\r\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! but why so?\xe2\x80\x94I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\r\nor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one subject,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope but one, on which we do not\r\nthink alike.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\r\nher face. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes nothing occur to you?\xe2\x80\x94Do not you recollect?\xe2\x80\x94Harriet\r\nSmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\r\nthough she knew not what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard from her yourself this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have, I\r\nbelieve, and know the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are prepared for the worst, I see\xe2\x80\x94and very bad it is. Harriet\r\nSmith marries Robert Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared\xe2\x80\x94and her eyes,\r\nin eager gaze, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, this is impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d but her lips were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Knightley; \xe2\x80\x9cI have it from Robert\r\nMartin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.\xe2\x80\x94I wish our opinions were\r\nthe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\r\nor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need\r\nnot talk much on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake me, you quite mistake me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, exerting herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\r\ncannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!\xe2\x80\x94You cannot mean to say,\r\nthat Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\r\nhas even proposed to her again\xe2\x80\x94yet. You only mean, that he intends it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that he has done it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\r\ndetermined decision, \xe2\x80\x9cand been accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Then having recourse to her workbasket,\r\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\r\nfeelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\r\nexpressing, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now tell me every thing; make this\r\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?\xe2\x80\x94Let me know it all. I never was\r\nmore surprized\xe2\x80\x94but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nhas it been possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\r\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\r\nto John.\xe2\x80\x94He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\r\nasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley\xe2\x80\x99s. They\r\nwere going to take the two eldest boys to Astley\xe2\x80\x99s. The party was to be\r\nour brother and sister, Henry, John\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Smith. My friend Robert\r\ncould not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely\r\namused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nhe did\xe2\x80\x94and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\r\nopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in\r\nvain.\xe2\x80\x94She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\r\ndeserving. He came down by yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s coach, and was with me this\r\nmorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\r\non my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\r\nthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer\r\nhistory when you see her.\xe2\x80\x94She will give you all the minute particulars,\r\nwhich only woman\xe2\x80\x99s language can make interesting.\xe2\x80\x94In our communications\r\nwe deal only in the great.\xe2\x80\x94However, I must say, that Robert Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did\r\nmention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\r\nbox at Astley\xe2\x80\x99s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and\r\nlittle John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one\r\ntime they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\xe2\x80\x94Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\r\nwas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\r\nShe must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence\r\ndisturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\r\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\r\nsituation is an evil\xe2\x80\x94but you must consider it as what satisfies your\r\nfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as\r\nyou know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x94As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in\r\nbetter hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\r\nsaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.\xe2\x80\x94You laugh at me about William\r\nLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\r\nto smile too broadly\xe2\x80\x94she did\xe2\x80\x94cheerfully answering,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\r\nHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\r\n_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\r\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\r\ncannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\r\nunprepared I was!\xe2\x80\x94for I had reason to believe her very lately more\r\ndetermined against him, much more, than she was before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to know your friend best,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Knightley; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nshould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\r\nvery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, I believe\r\nyou know her quite as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x94But, Mr. Knightley, are you\r\nperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him. I\r\ncould suppose she might in time\xe2\x80\x94but can she already?\xe2\x80\x94Did not you\r\nmisunderstand him?\xe2\x80\x94You were both talking of other things; of business,\r\nshows of cattle, or new drills\xe2\x80\x94and might not you, in the confusion of\r\nso many subjects, mistake him?\xe2\x80\x94It was not Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s hand that he was\r\ncertain of\xe2\x80\x94it was the dimensions of some famous ox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\r\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and so\r\nstrong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such\r\nemphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthat she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some\r\nmeasure, premature. It could not be otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you dare say this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Knightley. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you dare to suppose me\r\nso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?\xe2\x80\x94What do\r\nyou deserve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\r\nany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\r\nyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\r\nHarriet now are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, speaking very distinctly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he told\r\nme she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\r\ndoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\r\nit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\r\nof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\r\nher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be\r\ndone, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,\r\nhe said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand most sincerely wish them happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so\xe2\x80\x94for at that time I was a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and\r\nfor Robert Martin\xe2\x80\x99s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as\r\nmuch in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have\r\noften talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.\r\nSometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of\r\npleading poor Martin\xe2\x80\x99s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\r\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\r\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her\r\nhappiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.\xe2\x80\x94Much of this,\r\nI have no doubt, she may thank you for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, shaking her head.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh! poor Harriet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\r\npraise than she deserved.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\r\nfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\r\nstate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\r\ncollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till\r\nshe had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,\r\nshe could be fit for nothing rational.\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s business was to announce James\xe2\x80\x99s being gone out to put the\r\nhorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\r\nhad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\r\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\r\nHarriet\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\r\nsecurity.\xe2\x80\x94What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\r\nhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her\r\nown. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her\r\nhumility and circumspection in future.\r\n\r\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\r\nresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\r\nvery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\r\ndoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart\xe2\x80\x94such a Harriet!\r\n\r\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning\xe2\x80\x94Every thing would be a\r\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\r\n\r\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\r\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\r\nsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\r\npractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\r\nthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready\r\nto welcome as a duty.\r\n\r\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\r\nalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\r\nspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being\r\nobliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nThey arrived.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:\xe2\x80\x94but hardly had\r\nthey been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for\r\ncoming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\r\nblind, of two figures passing near the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Weston. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to\r\ntell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.\r\nHe stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend\r\nthe day with us.\xe2\x80\x94They are coming in, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94but there was a degree of confusion\xe2\x80\x94a number of embarrassing\r\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\r\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\r\nsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,\r\nthat Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had\r\nlong felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with\r\nJane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined\r\nthe party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer\r\na want of subject or animation\xe2\x80\x94or of courage and opportunity for Frank\r\nChurchill to draw near her and say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\r\nin one of Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s letters. I hope time has not made you less\r\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emma, most happy to begin, \xe2\x80\x9cnot in the least. I am\r\nparticularly glad to see and shake hands with you\xe2\x80\x94and to give you joy\r\nin person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\r\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs not she looking well?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter than she ever used to do?\xe2\x80\x94You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\r\ndoat upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\r\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\r\nDixon.\xe2\x80\x94Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can never think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout extreme shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shame,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cis all mine, or ought to be. But is it\r\npossible that you had no suspicion?\xe2\x80\x94I mean of late. Early, I know, you\r\nhad none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had the smallest, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat appears quite wonderful. I was once very near\xe2\x80\x94and I wish I had\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things,\r\nthey were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.\xe2\x80\x94It\r\nwould have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of\r\nsecrecy and told you every thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not now worth a regret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some hope,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, \xe2\x80\x9cof my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s being persuaded to pay a\r\nvisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\r\nare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I\r\ntrust, till we may carry her northward.\xe2\x80\x94But now, I am at such a\r\ndistance from her\xe2\x80\x94is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?\xe2\x80\x94Till this morning, we\r\nhave not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\r\nthought, he cried,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! by the bye,\xe2\x80\x9d then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mr. Knightley is well?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused.\xe2\x80\x94She coloured and\r\nlaughed.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\r\nin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.\xe2\x80\x94I assure you that I\r\nhave heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x94He is a\r\nman whom I cannot presume to praise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\r\nhis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\r\nand his next words were,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see such a skin?\xe2\x80\x94such smoothness! such delicacy!\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nwithout being actually fair.\xe2\x80\x94One cannot call her fair. It is a most\r\nuncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair\xe2\x80\x94a most\r\ndistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.\xe2\x80\x94Just colour\r\nenough for beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always admired her complexion,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma, archly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do\r\nnot I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\r\npale?\xe2\x80\x94When we first began to talk of her.\xe2\x80\x94Have you quite forgotten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no\xe2\x80\x94what an impudent dog I was!\xe2\x80\x94How could I dare\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not\r\nhelp saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\r\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.\xe2\x80\x94I am sure you had.\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nsure it was a consolation to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, no, no\xe2\x80\x94how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\r\nmiserable wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was\r\na source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\r\nall in.\xe2\x80\x94Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\r\ntruth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\r\nsituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf not in our dispositions,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently added, with a look of true\r\nsensibility, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which\r\nbids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not true on your side. You can\r\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.\xe2\x80\x94She is a complete angel. Look\r\nat her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\r\nthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.\xe2\x80\x94You will\r\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\r\nuncle means to give her all my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s jewels. They are to be new set. I\r\nam resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\r\nbeautiful in her dark hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery beautiful, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that\r\nhe gratefully burst out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\r\nlooks!\xe2\x80\x94I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\r\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\r\nof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\r\ninfant\xe2\x80\x99s appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\r\nbut it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of\r\nsending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston\r\nhad been almost as uneasy as herself.\xe2\x80\x94In ten minutes, however, the\r\nchild had been perfectly well again. This was her history; and\r\nparticularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her\r\nvery much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that\r\nshe had not done it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe should always send for Perry, if the child\r\nappeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.\r\nShe could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was\r\na pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child\r\nseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been\r\nbetter if Perry had seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerry!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\r\nFairfax\xe2\x80\x99s eye. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\r\nPerry?\xe2\x80\x94Has he been here this morning?\xe2\x80\x94And how does he travel now?\xe2\x80\x94Has\r\nhe set up his carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\r\nlaugh, it was evident from Jane\xe2\x80\x99s countenance that she too was really\r\nhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an extraordinary dream of mine!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can never think of\r\nit without laughing.\xe2\x80\x94She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\r\nit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\r\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\r\nwhich sent me the report, is passing under her eye\xe2\x80\x94that the whole\r\nblunder is spread before her\xe2\x80\x94that she can attend to nothing else,\r\nthough pretending to listen to the others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\r\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\r\nsteady voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!\xe2\x80\x94They _will_\r\nsometimes obtrude\xe2\x80\x94but how you can court them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\r\nEmma\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\r\nRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\r\nfelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\r\nregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\r\nsensible of Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x99s high superiority of character. The\r\nhappiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\r\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\r\nmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\r\nattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\r\nunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\r\nrecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\r\nfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\r\nalone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied\xe2\x80\x94unaccountable\r\nas it was!\xe2\x80\x94that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\r\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\r\n\r\nHarriet was a little distressed\xe2\x80\x94did look a little foolish at first: but\r\nhaving once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\r\nself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\r\nthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\r\nfullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\r\nmeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet was most\r\nhappy to give every particular of the evening at Astley\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\ndinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\r\nBut what did such particulars explain?\xe2\x80\x94The fact was, as Emma could now\r\nacknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\r\ncontinuing to love her had been irresistible.\xe2\x80\x94Beyond this, it must ever\r\nbe unintelligible to Emma.\r\n\r\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\r\nreason for thinking so.\xe2\x80\x94Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s parentage became known. She proved to\r\nbe the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\r\ncomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\r\nhave always wished for concealment.\xe2\x80\x94Such was the blood of gentility\r\nwhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!\xe2\x80\x94It was likely to be\r\nas untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a\r\nconnexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley\xe2\x80\x94or for the\r\nChurchills\xe2\x80\x94or even for Mr. Elton!\xe2\x80\x94The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached\r\nby nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\r\n\r\nNo objection was raised on the father\xe2\x80\x99s side; the young man was treated\r\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\r\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\r\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\r\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\r\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\r\nimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\r\nand who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and\r\noccupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\r\ntemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\r\nand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\r\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\r\nman;\xe2\x80\x94or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\r\n\r\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\r\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\r\ninto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and\r\nmust be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\r\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\r\nno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\r\ncould impair.\xe2\x80\x94Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\r\nbut as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x94Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\r\nthe three, were the first to be married.\r\n\r\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\r\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.\xe2\x80\x94The Mr. Churchills\r\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\r\nEmma and Mr. Knightley.\xe2\x80\x94They had determined that their marriage ought\r\nto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\r\nallow them the fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\r\nthe plan.\xe2\x80\x94John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\r\napproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x94how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to\r\nconsent?\xe2\x80\x94he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\r\ndistant event.\r\n\r\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\r\nalmost hopeless.\xe2\x80\x94A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.\xe2\x80\x94He began to\r\nthink it was to be, and that he could not prevent it\xe2\x80\x94a very promising\r\nstep of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he was not\r\nhappy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s courage\r\nfailed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying\r\nhimself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in\r\nthe assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were\r\nover, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated\xe2\x80\x94she could not\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\r\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s mind, or any wonderful change of his\r\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\r\nturkeys\xe2\x80\x94evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the\r\nneighbourhood also suffered.\xe2\x80\x94Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\r\nWoodhouse\xe2\x80\x99s fears.\xe2\x80\x94He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\r\nson-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\r\nnight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of\r\nthe Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of\r\nthem protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.\xe2\x80\x94But Mr. John Knightley\r\nmust be in London again by the end of the first week in November.\r\n\r\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\r\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\r\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Elton was called\r\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\r\njoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\r\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\r\ndetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\r\ninferior to her own.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cVery little white satin, very few lace veils; a\r\nmost pitiful business!\xe2\x80\x94Selina would stare when she heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94But,\r\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\r\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\r\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
