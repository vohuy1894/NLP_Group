BARBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, there is no book in circulation that tells, in\r\nconcise form, the story of the mechanical and commercial evolution of\r\nthe automobile, mirrors its sudden leap into popular use, and shows how\r\nit has demonstrated, in a most amazing way, the power of money to make\r\nmoney, describes its benefits to the world, and forecasts the future\r\npossibilities of the automobile industry as an investment.\r\n\r\nThis book, the \xe2\x80\x9cStory of the Automobile,\xe2\x80\x9d shows the struggle of man for\r\none hundred and fifty years to devise a means of propelling a vehicle\r\nwithout animal power.\r\n\r\nIt describes the various stages of the evolution of the idea of motive\r\nforce other than animal power, in France, England, Germany and the\r\nUnited States, and its triumphant culmination in a successful horseless\r\nvehicle. And it makes clear how, when the automobile became of\r\npractical use, its successful commercialization became most profitable\r\nin the shortest period of time of that of any product of man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ningenuity supplying an article to meet human wants.\r\n\r\nBut if this were all that could be recorded of the story of the\r\nautomobile, this book would not have been written. The automobile\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuccess demonstrates all this, and something more\xe2\x80\x94something that would\r\nnot ordinarily occur to a person unless his attention was called to it.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing history of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s success affords one of the\r\nmost convincing and the best modern instance of the opportunities that\r\nare being constantly presented for investing for profit.\r\n\r\nIt is a signal example kept in our hearing every day by the\r\nNiagara-like roar of the cars along our boulevards, of the fact that\r\nthis is the age of golden opportunities for making money make money\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nopportunities that disclose themselves, sometimes unexpectedly, and,\r\nwhen embraced, are apt to respond with a veritable avalanche of profits.\r\n\r\nFor was it not an avalanche of profits that overwhelmed the man who in\r\nthirteen years made $200,000,000 and was offered another $200,000,000\r\nfor only a small part of his business? And this great fortune made by\r\nHenry Ford did not exhaust the Ford automobile\xe2\x80\x99s possibilities, for\r\nmillions are still being taken out of the business, one investor of\r\n$2,000 having received over half a million dollars out of it lately.\r\n\r\nWhen men who are not 40 years old today came out of high school they\r\neither did not know what an automobile was or, if they had seen one\r\nof the very earliest samples, they had no vision of what it would\r\ndevelop into\xe2\x80\x94no conception of what the future had in store for the\r\nwabbly horseless vehicle, zig-zagging down the street, as a potential\r\nmoney-maker.\r\n\r\nAnd in the early days of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s struggles for recognition as\r\na promising investment, no banker or other moneyed man could be brought\r\nto believe that it held out any reasonable hopes of great gain. No one\r\ncould foresee, not even the inventors of the automobile, that in less\r\nthan two decades the business done through its comparative perfection\r\nwould rank fourth in order of the industries of the United States. And\r\nstill less was there anybody so foresighted in the possibilities that\r\nlie in money to make more money, as to vision the billions of dollars\r\nof profits to be paid out by this one idea of a horseless vehicle.\r\n\r\nWe can find few instances which so forcefully show, as the automobile\r\nindustry shows, the chances for profitable investment in a short time\r\nwhich may come from sources supplying the needs or pleasures of the\r\ngreat mass of the people.\r\n\r\nThe chapters of the \xe2\x80\x9cStory of the Automobile\xe2\x80\x9d devoted to its\r\ncommercialization make clear that its greatest success has been due\r\nto the production of automobiles at a price within reach of people of\r\nordinary means. For this the one man most responsible is Henry Ford. He\r\nhas demonstrated in a manner of many millions that the most money is to\r\nbe made out of things used by the greatest number of people\xe2\x80\x94things that\r\nbecome common needs.\r\n\r\nThe enduring truth of the profitableness of Philip D. Armour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napothegm, \xe2\x80\x9cMake and sell things that are \xe2\x80\x98et\xe2\x80\x99 up,\xe2\x80\x9d is not discredited\r\nby the automobile industry, for the use of the automobile \xe2\x80\x9ceats\xe2\x80\x9d up\r\nsteel, brass, wood, rubber, leather, gasoline and many other natural\r\nresources. The automobile wears out and has to be replaced, so it\r\nproperly comes in the category of things \xe2\x80\x9cet\xe2\x80\x9d up.\r\n\r\nThis truth, that the greatest profits lie in products that can be given\r\ngeneral distribution, with a consequent large sale, which is one I\r\nhave maintained in my book, \xe2\x80\x9cMaking Money Make Money,\xe2\x80\x9d in my magazine,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvesting for Profit,\xe2\x80\x9d and in all my teachings on the science\r\nof investing, finds a splendid exemplification in the automobile\r\nindustry\xe2\x80\x99s success as a phenomenally profitable form of investment, and\r\nthe circumstances of this success are but cumulative evidence of the\r\nsoundness of my doctrine.\r\n\r\nAnd the success of the automobile industry in the measure and with the\r\nspeed it has achieved verifies not only this claim I have made and\r\nmaintained, but confirms my contention of the value of co-operation.\r\n\r\nI have preached co-operation as urgently as I have advocated, as the\r\nbest objects of investment, the value of things used popularly and in\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cStory of the Automobile\xe2\x80\x9d could not have had written into it the\r\nglamour of the golden guerdons of Golconda but for Ford\xe2\x80\x99s idea of\r\nquantity production, reinforced by co-operative standardization of\r\nparts. Co-operation between the manufacturers produced standardization,\r\nand standardization enabled quantity production, and the low price\r\nwhich quantity consumption warranted has caused automobiles to be\r\nbought by millions, and the purchase of the automobile in millions,\r\ninstead of thousands, has made the hundreds of millions of dividends\r\nwhich this wonderful mine of profits has yielded.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cStory of the Automobile\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the best and most notable\r\nproofs of two of my convictions bedded in the concrete of experience,\r\nnamely, that the most promising investments are those made in natural\r\nresources and enterprises which the largest number of people can\r\npatronize, and that co-operation is one of the most effective forces\r\nin nature, and, therefore, applicable to the affairs of men as a\r\nbeneficent influence, and, if efficient, the handmaiden of success.\r\n\r\nThe story of the automobile has herein been treated in a way that not\r\nonly presents a graphic relation of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s development as an\r\ninvention, its commercialization, its benefits to man and the position\r\nit occupies as a notable example of earning power, but in a manner that\r\ndevelops the many morals taught by its success. The method of treatment\r\nof the subject matter is uncommon, and, for this reason, interesting, I\r\ntrust, to those who read the book.\r\n\r\nThe chapter contributed by Mr. Edward G. Westlake, automobile editor\r\nof the _Chicago Evening Post_, is a resume of automobile conditions\r\nfrom the intimate viewpoint of a writer who has specialized in the\r\nautomobile, and enjoys a deserved reputation as the dean of the\r\nautomobile editors of the daily newspaper press. Every one interested\r\nin automobiles will derive information and entertainment through\r\nreading Mr. Westlake\xe2\x80\x99s presentation of the amazing features of\r\nautomobile industrial figures. In it he states interesting facts not\r\nstated elsewhere in the volume.\r\n\r\nThe book\xe2\x80\x99s interest and value as a contribution to automobile\r\nliterature, of which there is not much in book form, would be less\r\nthan they are, but for the participation in its preparation by the\r\nBusiness Bourse International, Inc., New York, whose vice-president,\r\nMr. J. George Frederick, is one of the highest authorities on business\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\nThe chapter by the Business Bourse deals with the automobile industry\r\nfrom the standpoint of the financial and investment aspects of the\r\nautomobile, accessory and tire manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 securities, and Mr.\r\nFrederick\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in the financial world is a guarantee of the\r\nauthoritative accuracy of the facts presented in this chapter.\r\n\r\nCredit for salient facts in the history of the automobile, obtained and\r\nused in the \xe2\x80\x9cStory of the Automobile,\xe2\x80\x9d is given to a large volume of\r\nnearly 500 pages, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Romance of the Automobile Industry,\xe2\x80\x9d by James\r\nRood Doolittle, issued lately by The Klebold Press, New York city.\r\nThis volume is the most exhaustive work in book form yet published on\r\nthe automobile, and covers graphically every phase of its development\r\nand popularization. It is virtually a textbook and reference guide of\r\nfacts of motor car history, and devotes particular attention to the\r\npersonnel of the founders of the industry and those engaged in it, and\r\nthe association features.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that the work entailed in presenting this, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStory of the Automobile,\xe2\x80\x9d has been done sufficiently well to make it\r\ninteresting and instructive to those who read it.\r\n\r\n  H.

France and Germany might now have\r\nbeen doing the automobile business of the world, with England and this\r\ncountry buying from them, as England and France are now buying from the\r\nUnited States, whose automobile supremacy at this date is unquestioned.\r\n\r\nWhile the gasoline type of automobile today is the most popular, this\r\nis not to say that the electric type is not a success scientifically\r\nand commercially. Indeed, the future extent of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s use\r\nfor commercial purposes is said by experts to depend largely on the\r\nelectric driven type.\r\n\r\nAnd who will deny that but for Franklin the electric motor would not\r\nhave been, for it was he who wrested the thunderbolt from heaven, as\r\nwell as the sceptre of dominion over our land from the tyrant. Franklin\r\nas the discoverer of electricity may well be accorded the credit\r\nfor the electric automobile, which has played no small part in the\r\ndevelopment of the automobile industry, a fact which every student of\r\nautomobile history will concede.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, on an even firmer foundation than either of the\r\ncauses mentioned that Benjamin Franklin stands as contributing to the\r\nsuccess of the automobile industry. The inventors could invent and the\r\nmanufacturers could make the automobile, but who, pray, was to buy it,\r\nif it was to be in general use, if not the common people? And how, may\r\nwe ask, were the people going to buy it without money?\r\n\r\nAs the great teacher of frugality and thrift, Franklin laid the\r\ncornerstone, 150 years ago, on which the superstructure of the\r\nAmerican automobile industry has been erected. For, assuredly,\r\nhad the seed planted by him failed to germinate and ripen in the\r\nAmerican consciousness, we could as well have been today a nation\r\nof spendthrifts as a people self-denying, thrifty and frugal. He\r\ninculcated those principles of temperance and economy in the lives of\r\nour forefathers which have been handed down to us from one generation\r\nto another, to our advantage and as an aid to our saving habits, by\r\nwhich we are enabled to buy automobiles.\r\n\r\nMany a motor car today owes its ownership to the teachings of Franklin.\r\nMany an automobile buyer would never have become one had he not heeded\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s injunction, to \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, a patch on your coat and money in\r\nyour pocket is better and more creditable than a writ on your back and\r\nno money to take it off,\xe2\x80\x9d and the investor would not have put money\r\nin stocks of automobile companies if he had not learned the truth of\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s teaching that \xe2\x80\x9cMoney makes money, and the money that money\r\nmakes, makes more money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFranklin having done what he could to prepare American citizens to\r\neconomize and save against the day of the automobile, and to invest\r\ntheir money in its manufacture, and the American citizen having\r\nfollowed his teachings and accumulated enough to buy at least a Ford,\r\nand perhaps a few shares of automobile company stocks, the man appeared\r\nwho produced the first gasoline automobile in the United States. That\r\nman was Charles E. Duryea. His reputation rests on the fact that,\r\nthough there were steam and electric automobiles in existence, and the\r\ngasoline motor had been developed, he was the first to put gasoline\r\nmotor and buggy body into co-ordination and make the first run the\r\nsecond. To Duryea, the constructor of the \xe2\x80\x9cbuggy-aut,\xe2\x80\x9d is accorded the\r\ncredit, by automobile history, of being the father of the American\r\ngasoline car.\r\n\r\nFollowing Duryea by only one year, came the genius who put into\r\ngeneral circulation the universal car.\r\n\r\nA reading of Henry Ford\xe2\x80\x99s biography discloses that his first idea, that\r\nthe big money was in production in quantity\xe2\x80\x94that a million articles\r\nsold at a profit of 50 cents each was a better paying transaction\r\nthan ten thousand sold at $3.00 each\xe2\x80\x94was in connection with a watch.\r\nWatches and clocks were the first things that Ford subjected to the\r\nmechanical promptings of his boyish mind, and he had it all planned out\r\nto make a 50-cent watch before Ingersoll had conceived the commercial\r\npossibilities of a dollar one.\r\n\r\nAn accident which his father met with called him from Detroit to the\r\nMichigan farm, and this accident deprived the country of a 50-cent\r\nwatch and gave it a $350 automobile instead. And most people will agree\r\nthat it was a fair exchange and no robbery. Thomas A. Edison, strange\r\nas it may sound, was responsible for the practically universal use of\r\nthe Ford automobile, for he it was, who, by the chance remark, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nyou want to do to make money is to make quantity,\xe2\x80\x9d started Ford on\r\nhis downward price career. We have it from Mr. Ford himself that he\r\nheard this statement by Edison, and that it so impressed him that he\r\nmade it the rule and guide of his life; that he never renounced the\r\nidea. When, after building a motor that was a success and commanded\r\nthe attention and capital of moneyed men in Detroit, Ford formed\r\nhis first company to build his car, this great idea was obstinately\r\nadhered to by him, and was the cause of his falling out with his\r\nmoneyed partners. They could not see the light which has given Ford his\r\nhalo\xe2\x80\x94the great white light of quantity production. This light burns\r\nwith steady brilliancy because it is generated by the great principle\r\nof the greatest good to the largest number. Ford\xe2\x80\x99s associates in his\r\nfirst company were not believers in this principle, evidently, because\r\nwhen they fell out with Ford about it, and Ford got out of the company\r\nto start the one he now controls, they went ahead making cars that\r\nsell today for from $2,300 to $3,900. But though they have made fair\r\nprofits, they have not made the fabulous sums that Ford has, and one\r\ncan only wonder how they feel about it, and if they realize the error\r\nof their views. They are probably wiser if not richer.\r\n\r\nThe success of Ford\xe2\x80\x99s idea of quantity sales demonstrates a great fact\r\nin the affairs of life. It is that fields of human endeavor are not\r\nexhausted or worked out until the human race has ceased to exist. Take\r\nany line of enterprise you will, and it has as many facets as a prism.\r\nAn idea only is needed, which, if the right one, illustrates the\r\nenterprise as lights thrown on the prism cause it to sparkle in many\r\ncolored rays.\r\n\r\nWe think, for instance, that the acme has been reached in the making\r\nand marketing of bread, but along comes a man with an idea for making\r\nbread of bran, and he is immediately ushered into the inner sanctum\r\nof the temple of great profits. Or we imagine that the last word has\r\nbeen said in cereal foodstuffs, when lo, and behold, the man with the\r\nright idea proves that the field has room and to spare for a financial\r\nsuccess in so simple a thing as rice dressed in a palatable and salable\r\nform. And so it is in everything, automobiles especially. The man who\r\nconceives the idea of a sport car supplies a want that others have\r\nneglected. There may be many automobile tractors on the market, but the\r\nhuman brain conceives one with some feature lacking in others, such,\r\nfor instance, as making a Ford automobile interchangeable into a farm\r\ntractor, and it has an immediate and large success. And if anybody had\r\nan idea that the profits from producing petroleum might be limited by\r\nthe use of gas and electric light, it was because the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenormous consumption of gasoline and the use of oil by ships could not\r\nbe foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe field for investment is kept constantly fallow, and ready for the\r\nseed that is to fructify into great profits, by the human brain which\r\nis ever active\xe2\x80\x94ever thinking. If its product is not an elemental,\r\nit is a supplementary idea, as the rubber tire, the demountable rim\r\nand the self-starter for automobiles. Until the world has arrived at\r\nperfection in all things, the ultimate will not have been reached.\r\nThe opportunities of today and tomorrow are as great as they were\r\nyesterday. It is a question whether they are not greater, for if the\r\nquotation ascribed to Emerson is true, that the world will beat a\r\npath to the door, though it be in a forest, of him who makes a mouse\r\ntrap better than his neighbor, the future possibilities of enterprise\r\nare favored by increased population and the element of the cumulative\r\nnature of the wants of man. As inventions and articles of use increase\r\nin number, new needs which demand supplementary products are created.\r\nEach new thing given to the world brings in its train other new things.\r\nThe crank of a Ford auto creates a demand for a self-starter. The\r\nincrease in population and wealth brings in its train a multiplication\r\nof human units whose use of created things is on a crescendo scale.\r\n\r\nThe financial successes in the automobile business, great as they\r\nare, have followed the inexorable law that the richest returns in\r\nall investments are the ground floor ones. The history of no big\r\nbusiness demonstrates more clearly that the way to make money is to\r\ninvest in new companies when they are offering the first authorized\r\ncapitalization for investment subscription. Money-making opportunities\r\nfor new investors are always greatest in enterprises whose development\r\nis ahead and in the future. If they have reached the stage where\r\ndevelopment is already producing great profits, the door is closed to\r\nthe new investor, or else he must pay a premium to sit in such paying\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIn the ground floor days of the Ford money-making machine, Miss Couzens\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crisked\xe2\x80\x9d $100 on Ford. That $100 produced $100,000 in cold cash. But\r\nit did so only because the inception of the Ford enterprise provided\r\nthe opportunity. Having made its half a billion, or more, the Ford\r\nenterprise is no longer enterable on any basis that would give such\r\nreturns for each dollar invested. When money is needed enterprise is\r\nwilling to pay liberally for its use. When enterprise has all the money\r\nit wants, money\xe2\x80\x99s value to it is less. This is the most natural law. It\r\nis a law that operates in other things besides money. \xe2\x80\x9cHe that hath,\r\nneeds not; he that hath not, wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe automobile industry illustrates graphically that when an enterprise\r\ndevelops to the point where it is well grounded and has reached a\r\nperiod of age and steady earning capacity, it is not new investors\r\nwho may come in and gather the richest plums, but the old ones, those\r\nwho helped to give it its start, who stood by it when the future was\r\nobscure, and the ultimate outcome not certain. There is probably no\r\nbusiness that shows as many people in it now, who were in it at the\r\nstart, as the automobile business. This applies to manufacturers,\r\ndistributors and investors, and is, to a certain extent, due to the\r\nindustry\xe2\x80\x99s newness. The original Ford investors are practically all\r\nintact. It is the original investors who have reaped the reward of\r\ntheir courage in embarking in new enterprise, and who have shared in\r\nthe division of the juicy melons the automobile companies have cut in\r\nthe form of huge stock and other dividends. We need no better proof of\r\nthe fact that ground floor investments promise the greatest returns on\r\nmoney invested than the financial history of the automobile.\r\n\r\nWhile quantity production and the co-operative spirit which led to\r\nstandardization were the keystones in the structure of the present day\r\nautomobile success, the history of the successful development of the\r\nautomobile demonstrates another fact, which is a vital one in the\r\nrealm of investment.\r\n\r\nThis fact is that most great financial successes are built on our\r\nnatural resources. This is peculiarly so of the automobile industry.\r\nThe steel, wood, rubber, leather and glass of which the automobile is\r\ncomposed, are all products of the ground, the forest or the farm. It\r\ncould not be said that the products of the earth directly make the\r\nprofits of a stock life insurance company, but this can be said of the\r\nautomobile industry, and its history discloses that the automobile\r\nbusiness of the United States was four times rescued from failure,\r\nfirst, by petroleum, for steam and electric cars would not sell in\r\nquantities, and the gasoline from petroleum was needed to give the\r\nautomobile its great vogue, once by tungsten, vanadium and chromium,\r\nagain by the quantity production theory, and finally by co-operative\r\nstandardization.\r\n\r\nAt one period of automobile development, the manufacturers were ready\r\nto give up in despair because cold-rolled and high carbon steels\r\nonly were available, and these made the weight of the car and the\r\nprice obstacles to its popular adoption. At the stage when failure\r\nto produce a car at popular price was imminent, there entered on\r\nthe scene tungsten, chromium, vanadium and aluminum, all natural\r\nresources, and they, combining with standardization, made quantity\r\nproduction possible. Tungsten, alloyed with steel for valves, chrome\r\nsteel for springs, vanadium in steel to impart purity, and aluminum for\r\nlightness, reduced the weight of the automobile 25 per cent, enabled\r\nmotors to be made smaller, tires lighter, original cost less, and cut\r\ndown upkeep cost to the users of cars. Quantity production thus was\r\nmade possible, and natural resources again vindicated their claim to\r\nbeing premier possibilities of profit.\r\n\r\nOf the future of the automobile and of products allied with it or\r\nsharing in its construction and prosperity, as continuing money-makers,\r\nall indications are that the profits already taken out of the motor\r\ncar industry in the United States are but placer croppings, and that\r\nthe years to come will record the workings of the real vein. This real\r\nvein, in the opinion of the man who looks ahead, is in the use of\r\npassenger cars, haulage trucks and motor tractors by the fifty million\r\nof the population of this union of states who are on or of the farm.\r\n\r\nAs yet, the farmers have not risen to the full possibilities of motor\r\npower in economic superiority over horse power for haulage, ground\r\ncultivation, and other uses to which the horse is now put. Elements\r\nwhich will hasten this awakening are the scarcity of man labor and\r\nthe workings of the immutable law of economics. There is not enough\r\nfood being produced by the world to supply the demand. If there were,\r\nprices would be lower. Prices will remain high as long as the supply\r\nfalls below the demand. As long as they remain high, the stimulation\r\nto greater production will continue, and this urge can have but one\r\nresult, which is to force the producer to adopt the most economical\r\nmethod of production.\r\n\r\nIt has been determined that motor power is cheaper than horse power. It\r\nis, therefore, only a question of time when the horse will go from the\r\nfarm as he is disappearing from the cities. In this evolution will be\r\nfound the money-making possibilities of investment in the motor tractor\r\nand the motor truck. Their adaptation to the smallest as well as the\r\nlargest needs of the tiller of the land is now being assured.\r\n\r\nWith the horse, the farmers of the United States have been able to\r\nbreak up only 70 per cent of the cultivable land not in timber. There\r\nare over two hundred million acres of tillable land that have never\r\nfelt the cold steel of a chilled plow. There are two hundred million\r\nmore acres in timber that will, much of it, ultimately come under the\r\nplow. Besides crippling the labor supply in this country, the European\r\nwar has taken a million horses out of our supply. The case in favor of\r\nthe tractor coming ultimately into common use seems from all this to be\r\ncompletely made out\xe2\x80\x94its adoption in large numbers being only a question\r\nof getting the price down to a basis which will insure quantity\r\nproduction. As this was done with passenger automobiles, it would be\r\nfolly to say it will not be done with tractors and trucks.\r\n\r\nFigures showing the total amount of money that has been taken in\r\nprofits out of the automobile industry have never been compiled. It\r\nis a business that has developed so rapidly and feverishly that the\r\nwater churned up by the commotion it has made has not yet settled. But\r\nthere is a record of enough individual instances of gigantic profits to\r\nprove that the largest individual appetite for dividends should have\r\nbeen satisfied by the ratio of earnings already made in automobile\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nBut in every case the greatest profits were in the stock of those\r\ncompanies that complied with Edison\xe2\x80\x99s rule of large money-making\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nyou want to do to make money is to make quantity.\xe2\x80\x9d And they were also\r\ncompanies which made an automobile that could be \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98et\xe2\x80\x99 up,\xe2\x80\x9d as Armour\r\nput it, by time and use, in less time than it takes time and use to eat\r\nup a higher priced machine.\r\n\r\nFord, Overland, Reo\xe2\x80\x94you will recognize this trinity as the leaders in\r\nsales, and by the same token they have been the leaders in profits.\r\nWhen it is stated that Henry Ford made $200,000,000 in thirteen years,\r\nand was then offered a like amount for only a small part of his\r\nenterprise, we may well believe that he credits his own statement that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9canything for only a few people is no good. It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be good for\r\neverybody or it won\xe2\x80\x99t survive.\xe2\x80\x9d Other Ford investors profited on the\r\nbasis of $5,000,000 for each $10,000 invested. After the parent Ford\r\ncompany had established a record of a million dollars a week in profits\r\nin the United States alone, Ford stepped across the river into Canada\r\nand organized a company there which is earning fifty per cent a year on\r\nits capital of $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nProfits of $52,000,000 in capital stock alone which has been built\r\nup almost entirely of dividends earned, is the record of the\r\nWillys-Overland Company. John North Willys founded the success of\r\nthis great money-making business on his personal check of $500,\r\ncashed at great trouble during the panic of 1907, when the Overland\r\ncompany was ready to go into bankruptcy. Besides the dividends\r\napplied to increasing the capital, an immense amount in profits\r\nhas been disbursed by this enterprise. The dividends in 1916 were\r\n$11,000,000, over 20 per cent of the capital. This year they will\r\nlikely be nearly double that amount. The Reo Motor Car Company has\r\npaid over $50,000 on an investment of $1,000. These three are not\r\nby any means all the automobile companies which have contributed\r\nto make the automobile industry a signal example of the earning\r\npower of money, but they represent the leaders of the popular or\r\nquantity-production-through-low-price type. There are about 150\r\npassenger automobile companies that are profitable in varying degrees,\r\nproportioned to their price, not to say anything of trucks and\r\ntractors, in the marketing of which fortunes are also being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\xe2\x80\x94AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRIAL FIGURES ARE AMAZING.\r\n\r\nBY EDWARD G. WESTLAKE,\r\n\r\n_Automobile Editor, The Chicago Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1916 the automobile industry in the United States\r\nentered the \xe2\x80\x9cbillion dollar class,\xe2\x80\x9d and manufacturers who have\r\nmembership in the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce which holds\r\nthe industry, as it were, in the hollow of its great hand, made no more\r\nado over this significant, almost amazing development than to meet in\r\nthe annual banquet and reiterate their statements that the critic did\r\nnot live who could predict, with certainty, the gain that might be made\r\nin 1917.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the industry would climb into the billion dollar\r\nfold\xe2\x80\x94men said that the fourth industry in the country had the financial\r\nstage set for starring the \xe2\x80\x9cBig Billion,\xe2\x80\x9d and they never permit\r\nthemselves to see a possibility of a recession unless steel becomes\r\ntoo great to be kept within bounds\xe2\x80\x94in short material price is the only\r\nproblem the venturesome automobile maker will put down for earnest\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nAccurate figures spread on the records of the National Automobile\r\nChamber of Commerce indicate that retail sales of motor vehicles in\r\n1916 totaled $1,068,028,273. This total includes a production of\r\n1,525,578 cars and 92,130 trucks. The passenger cars were valued at\r\n$921,378,000 and the trucks were listed at $166,650,275. When the\r\nstatisticians of the national organization compared figures and found\r\nthe gain was 80 per cent, and paused long enough to find that the gain\r\nthe year previous had been 36 per cent, they talked about the complete\r\nautomobilization of the country and the inevitable addition of more\r\nthan 2,000,000 to the total of cars in operation in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE DROP IN ONE YEAR.\r\n\r\nWeight decreased, as the engineers had planned, and the average price\r\nof cars decreased in one year from $671 to $605. In the eight previous\r\nyears the average price of automobiles had dropped from $2,125 to $814.\r\nWall Street, which once had only the cold shoulder for the automobile\r\nproducer, took a permanent seat at the table where daily the industry\r\nwas dissected, analyzed, weighed, discussed and reviewed; and, as a\r\nresult, it is as difficult to keep from the financial eyes of Wall\r\nStreet the operations of the great automobile factories as it would\r\nbe to hide the clearing house reports. The keenest financial and\r\ncommercial experts of the United States have learned to keep the motor\r\ncar industry constantly under surveillance\xe2\x80\x94not that they mistrust the\r\nmanufacturers, but that they have found the industrial situation is so\r\nfirmly linked to the dollars and cents program of the country\xe2\x80\x99s economy\r\nthat nothing may successfully act to deprecate the importance of the\r\nauto industry. Time was when General Motors sold as low as 40\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nStock Exchange expert would expect to see this stock sell for less than\r\n105?\xe2\x80\x94and if conditions were to become so chaotic that General Motors,\r\nwith its prosperous units, were to break to a point or two under par,\r\nwhat financial student would not search for something akin to a Black\r\nFriday?\r\n\r\nImmutable laws work in the automobile industry. The maker daily takes\r\na course in the University of Production, because an army of selling\r\nfactors constantly is attending to the absorption facilities of the\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s markets and he rarely permits himself the task of figuring on\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cprobable saturation point.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a wonderfully important thing\r\nto the maker that the national Organization gets official reports,\r\nguides the policies of standardization, holds an indefinable influence\r\nover the engineers of the industry, and sits as the congress of the\r\nRepublic of Motor Car Production. The auto industry of today is,\r\nperhaps, the most intricate thing in the country, and yet so responsive\r\nto the law of supply and demand that there is not an element of\r\nguesswork in it.\r\n\r\nAlthough more than two hundred automobile concerns that had entered\r\nthe arena of business, developing from the \xe2\x80\x9cblue print stage\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nmanufacturing concerns of considerable output, had failed in the last\r\ntwelve years, the automobile industry had been a big paying one.\r\nPioneers who remain and whose works annually pay dividends, accepted\r\nthe failures as the necessary concomitant of a great business that only\r\nshowed an output of 3,700 cars in 1899 and only 11,000 vehicles in\r\n1903, the amount growing to 485,000 cars in the year 1913.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur house is a generally well ordered one,\xe2\x80\x9d the maker delighted in\r\nsaying. \xe2\x80\x9cThe industry is like a science. The engineer has brought\r\nstandardization to almost finality, the matter of styles and body\r\ndesigns is an exact science, the tire companies have been keen rivals\r\nbut beneath their terrific competition they have permitted the stream\r\nof co-operation in tire standardization to run smoothly, and the\r\nmanufacturer has spent his money wisely in equipping his plant with\r\nplenty of large-quantity type of machinery and increased his plant\r\nto enable him to handle the large production. Increased production in\r\neconomically managed plants spells the maximum of profit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT OF SATURATION FAR OFF.\r\n\r\nAnd with experts bold enough to say that the field of prospects facing\r\nthe industry numbers 5,000,000 probable buyers, little thought is given\r\nto imminence of \xe2\x80\x9csaturation\xe2\x80\x9d and a consequent rehabilitation of the\r\nmotor manufacturing and distributing plans. In the plainest language\r\nthat it is possible for the automobile maker to use he says today: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nmaker who has an adequate organization and builds a pleasure car or\r\ntruck that is as good as specified and who permits no retrogression in\r\nhis organization, will succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuxury and necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d The automobile maker is willing to have his\r\nproduct classed in this way. For the early years of the industry the\r\ncar was a clear cut \xe2\x80\x9cluxury.\xe2\x80\x9d It weighed so much that its cost was\r\nprohibitive to the big family of \xe2\x80\x9cNecessity.\xe2\x80\x9d The car simply had to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chad\xe2\x80\x9d by men of large incomes. Automobiles were not sold by intensive\r\nsalesmen in those days\xe2\x80\x94the family bought them, even as a fine jewel was\r\npurchased at the great jewelry houses. Tremendous prices were paid, in\r\ncomparison to the set prices of the automobile industry at this day.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d of the car that stood in front of the owner\xe2\x80\x99s home often was\r\naccepted as a basis for rating the social position of the owner. Seat\r\ncushions, slip covers, fine upholstery and the name plate on the car\r\ntold a big and varied story.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the craze to buy the high priced cars, developed\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cman Friday\xe2\x80\x9d of the industry\xe2\x80\x94the chauffeur. And the chauffeur\r\nworked readily with the wealthy man, often advising the purchase of\r\nthe foreign machine upon which Uncle Sam collected a very large duty.\r\nBut the foreign made car had its stamp of distinction, perhaps much\r\neasier to utilize in the form of extravagant, even snobbish, style\r\nof life that the owner of the foreign car elected to affect, and the\r\nUnited States manufacturer of cars was not at all prepared to put out\r\na car that would correct the desire of Americans to drive around in an\r\nimported article.\r\n\r\nBut the domestic car had a friend in this contingency. Economical\r\nliving was that friend. Ruin often followed the extravagance of\r\nthose who bought the high priced and, as many experts said, inferior\r\nimported cars. Homes were mortgaged and all the financial trails were\r\ntraversed in the effort to maintain an impossible extravagant life.\r\nThe banker began to detest the automobile. It seemed to him that it\r\nwas undermining the life of the nation. Something had to be done to\r\ncorrect, also, the tone of the domestic automobile maker\xe2\x80\x99s life. He\r\ndeveloped a desire for watered stock. Over capitalization of his plant\r\nwas suspected by the banking interests, and on every hand the motor car\r\nindustry was decried. Waste and inflation stalked arm in arm through\r\nmany plants. It even was said that the industry was only a \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d; that\r\nincompetent executives kept their eyes on the broker\xe2\x80\x99s tape, while\r\ncorps of associates in the factories were ready to play the \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nall it would stand.\r\n\r\nFew were blind to the prospects in the motor industry at that time, if\r\nthe financial interests of the country were estranged; but no one was\r\nable to withstand the developments. The fire of criticism cleaned out\r\nthe dross. Organization, the big thing needed to eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand give the industry the foundation upon which the large \xe2\x80\x9cbillion\r\ndollar business\xe2\x80\x9d subsequently was built, began to come into being. Men\r\nof energy and brains got to work. These characters have remained. There\r\nare those veterans of the industry who say that the year 1907 marked\r\nthe start of the business on the basis of a real industry. In that year\r\n44,000 cars was the total output, and the value of the product was\r\nregistered at $93,400,000. This was the highest total of value for the\r\noutput of the industry so far reached in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe next year the industry built 85,000 cars, valued at $137,800,000,\r\nand quantity production, efficient buying of material, strict\r\nattention to cost production in the plants, effective steps toward\r\nstandardization, engineering methods that abolished a great deal of\r\nweight, etc., began to be set standards among car makers. The official\r\nstatements of the industry show how well the improvements fitted in.\r\nIn 1909 the production of automobiles amounted to 126,500, valued at\r\n$164,200,000. The following year the output climbed above the 200,000\r\nmark, and since then the production figures have mounted steadily.\r\nAutomobiles were _sold_ and competition became keener, but the output\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF RELIABILITY CONTESTS.\r\n\r\nWith the new era of development in the early nineties came into\r\nprominence farseeing manufacturers who paid heed to the thought that\r\nthe best way to put a fit and efficient motor car into the hands\r\nof the public was to test the car, its material and its mechanical\r\npractices, in some officially conducted series of reliability contests.\r\nBesides, it was urged there was a \xe2\x80\x9cromance of business\xe2\x80\x9d attached to the\r\nmotor car industry that would lead to a greatly increased amount of\r\npublicity in the press.\r\n\r\nThe national annual reliability competitions grew into wonderful\r\nfavor. Makers strove hard to win the reliability titles. The \xe2\x80\x9cGlidden\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntours became the tests that attracted not only the attention of every\r\nautomobile man, but the general public. The whole country became the\r\ntesting ground. For several years these national events did well the\r\nwork they were expected to perform. Automobile building received,\r\nperhaps, its most practical aid. Makers learned. They took advantage\r\nboth of the mechanical data and the publicity. A complex but valuable\r\nadjunct of the national tours became popular\xe2\x80\x94every region in which the\r\nAmerican Automobile Association was a factor, and this organization\r\ncontinues to be a powerful aid to the industry, had its reliability or\r\nits endurance classic.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the manufacturers of automobiles lost interest in\r\nnational reliability tours after the test of 1911. Perhaps many did.\r\nBut the truth, as told by a wonderfully efficient engineer, is that\r\nthere remained nothing more that a national tour could teach the car\r\nbuilder. He had measured the power of his steel to withstand shock, he\r\nhad calculated the efficiency of his motor to stand its daily tasks on\r\na strenuous schedule, he had learned of the troubles of his rivals and\r\nhe had spent his money liberally, at the direction of his engineering\r\ndepartment, to make a car that would do anything a less skillful driver\r\nthan a national tour pilot could ask of the machine. The national tour\r\nbecame a luxury. It was revived in 1913 on the long and strenuous grind\r\nfrom Minneapolis to the Rocky Mountains, and an immense amount of\r\nvaluable information was the result. But the national tour seems to be\r\nnow chiefly remembered by the occasional discourse of an engineer who\r\ntells of the long struggles in the mud and the hardships of sand and\r\ndust storms.\r\n\r\nWith the added development of the plants, came another reason why the\r\nnational tour was not necessary. Testing tracks were added to the\r\nmaker\xe2\x80\x99s plant assets. Testing on the roads followed the block tests of\r\nthe motors, and it began to be accepted as an axiom in the industry\r\nthat the engineer knew to a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth what his engine could do\r\nbefore it went out of the secret room where the chief engineer worked.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile prices constantly were beaten down. The field of opportunity\r\nto own a car widened. It was, even then, so much bigger, in comparison\r\nto that in the Old World, that even the clerk and small salaried man in\r\ngeneral looked with a smile toward the day when he would own a car.\r\n\r\nIt is recalled that when the manufacturer began boldly to put the\r\nfarmer in the class of available prospects\xe2\x80\x94openly declared his idea\r\nof building a car that he could sell in the agricultural districts\r\nas readily as cars were sold in the city districts, one man who this\r\nyear is making 750,000 automobiles, gave to the world his edict which\r\nresulted later in the United States court sustaining his contention\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9cSelden patent\xe2\x80\x9d under which the organization of makers was\r\nmaintaining its official life, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not basic, in fact was not worth\r\nthe paper it was printed on,\xe2\x80\x9d and he would refuse ever to recognize\r\nthe right of the national organization to grant licenses to make the\r\ninternal combustion engine and the chassis that went with it.\r\n\r\nThe public read with a strange feeling, the record of the great\r\nlitigation against the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic patent.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed like a battle of\r\nTitans, and ordinary folk thought it might result in danger to the\r\nindustry. But only the lawyers were strenuously engaged. They argued\r\nand submitted briefs for more than two years, the national organization\r\nof the makers who accepted the license of the \xe2\x80\x9cSelden patent,\xe2\x80\x9d honoring\r\ntheir national organization by paying to the treasury their pro rata\r\non the amount of cars made.\r\n\r\nAn enormous fund grew. But the man who wanted to make from 200,000 to\r\n750,000 cars a year was determined. He won in the Federal court and\r\nalmost immediately the \xe2\x80\x9clicensed association\xe2\x80\x9d began to break up. The\r\ncontributions of license fees ceased and soon the association was a\r\nthing of history. It was succeeded by the National Chamber of Commerce\r\nwhich has become the senate, house of congress\xe2\x80\x94the parliament, if you\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x94of the automobile industry in the United States. Some, there\r\nwere, who had a very poorly defined idea of the actual mission of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clicensed association,\xe2\x80\x9d believing that it was a \xe2\x80\x9ctrust,\xe2\x80\x9d called its\r\nfunction destructive. They thought that the officers of the association\r\nwould lay an embargo upon certain manufacturers and allot a more\r\nliberal figure on annual output to the larger and stronger firms in the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORD, A \xe2\x80\x9cWIZARD\xe2\x80\x9d AND \xe2\x80\x9cGENIUS.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at that time, the licensed association had not the grasp\r\non patent protective measures, engineering work, standardization,\r\netc., that obtains in the present national organization, and the real\r\nmission of the licensed association never became wholly evident to the\r\npublic. But the organization did its part in laying the foundations of\r\nthe industry. It made the handwriting on the wall for popular price so\r\nlarge, that every man who subsequently invested a dollar in automobile\r\nmaking read, pondered and agreed. It placed popular price and\r\nstandardization of mechanism in the same category\xe2\x80\x94linked them so that\r\nthe words of the Detroit automobile manufacturing wizard became axioms.\r\nThe Detroit genius had proved that the depth and capacity of the\r\nautomobile market was exactly in ratio to the possible price reduction.\r\nAmazing but true, the big men said, was the field that the lower priced\r\ncar opened to the thoughtful maker of cars. Manufacturers began to\r\ntalk of some day building and selling as high as a million automobiles\r\nin one year. Others calmly declared that when the motor car sales in\r\ncities began to \xe2\x80\x9cslow up,\xe2\x80\x9d there would be still more than 5,000,000\r\nprospects in the agricultural districts. Others drew diagrams intended\r\nto show that there would be a market for any priced cars that were\r\nbuilt in this country, the few persons with large incomes assimilating\r\nall the high priced cars, and the many with average incomes absorbing\r\nthe quantity production at popular prices. All allowances were made for\r\nthe increase in the cost of labor, materials such as steels and other\r\nmetals, leather, etc., and some even went far enough to include the\r\npossibility of a foreign war on large proportions and its effect upon\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\nNo one gave concrete thought at that time to the possibility of a\r\nskillfully conducted partial payment organization of a national nature\r\nthat would aid the small salaried man in buying his automobile on time\r\npayments. But that came about and still is working out its part in\r\nthe great economic scheme of distribution of the factory output. The\r\nmakers did not essay digging into the dealers\xe2\x80\x99 and distributors\xe2\x80\x99 plans\r\nfor moving cars delivered to them for cash from the factories, and\r\nthey were not bold enough to say they could finance any time payment\r\nand chattel mortgage plans. But many of them admitted the great value\r\nof the plan, if a distributer, through a proper alliance with his\r\nbanker, could make sales in that manner and realize his money. The\r\npublic learned well, early, that the maker of cars rarely consigned\r\nany automobiles to a dealer. The maker sold for cash\xe2\x80\x94the draft had to\r\nbe presented by the dealer or distributer before he could unload the\r\nfreight car. It would be legitimate business, the public said, for any\r\nautomobile dealer to finance himself so that he could sell cars on\r\ntime. On time today is a mighty big phrase in the industry. It means\r\nmany a car added to the annual output.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of incomes in the United States the statisticians found\r\nthere were more than 6,000,000 people in this country with annual\r\nincomes of more than $1,200, and 3,500,000 with annual incomes of more\r\nthan $1,800. All these things aided in installing confidence in the big\r\nmen of the motor industry. Quantity production became the password for\r\nthe manufacturer. A new development in distribution was wonderfully\r\nimproved\xe2\x80\x94dealers from all over the country were brought to the factory\r\nof the car maker, and after a convention of a few days, the dealers\r\nwere invited to sign up for the coming year, nominating the number\r\nand type of models they would buy. The maker pored over his order\r\nblanks when the dealers left, made his plans for material accordingly,\r\nand there was only prosperity in each automobile factory, as a rule,\r\nfor the remainder of the year. The orders were indicative of, safely\r\nspeaking, sixty per cent of the signed total. Some makers took chances\r\nand built very close to the total agreed on by the dealers, and, except\r\nin few cases, the scheme worked out. Today the maker studies all\r\nconditions and accepts the orders of his dealers, setting the figure of\r\noutput after numerous factory conferences.\r\n\r\nMakers who could point to an annual production of, say 400 cars,\r\ntook counsel among themselves, and some 50 increased their factory\r\nefficiency and financial responsibility that they can now point to\r\nan output of as many cars in one day as they made early in their\r\nmanufacturing experience in one season.\r\n\r\nThe writer recalls one manufacturer who, about nine years ago, had an\r\noutput of about 500 cars for one season. Only recently he paid close to\r\na quarter of a million dollars, if indeed his extra expenses did not\r\nbring the total to $300,000, to conduct a twenty-one day convention at\r\nhis factory covering a site of seventy-nine acres, at which dealers\r\nfrom the four quarters of the country were entertained. He had daily\r\nmeetings in the big halls of his administration building, and his\r\nlieutenants carefully outlined to all the plans of the company for the\r\nyear, and exploited the line of models.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have $30,000,000 in materials purchased, and expect to get all\r\nthis material when we need it for manufacturing cars,\xe2\x80\x9d said the big\r\nman to his dealers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the war in Europe has caused many problems of\r\nprice and quantify to arise, and heaven only knows what the material\r\nsituation will be after July 1. I advise you to order all the cars\r\nyou need\xe2\x80\x94think well of your requirements\xe2\x80\x94and stick by that number.\r\nThen you will not be like many are bound to be, who are indifferent to\r\nmanufacturing conditions\xe2\x80\x94you will have cars to meet the biggest demand\r\nthe industry ever has known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat automobile president had the pleasure of meeting thousands of\r\ndealers, speaking to more than one thousand of them daily, and with\r\nhis factory production manager he figured the probable needs of his\r\ncountry-wide organization of dealers and branch houses for the year.\r\nIt is significant that the few changes he made on his early winter\r\nproduction table, which the writer was permitted to scan, were made\r\nonly in the \xe2\x80\x9cincrease columns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PART MACHINING PLAYS.\r\n\r\nIt would lead to the exhaustion of the reader were many details to\r\nbe given showing how the makers made quantity production and economy\r\nof factory operation an assured thing. The largest rooms of wholly\r\nautomatic machinery were equipped, so that a large amount of crude\r\nsteel wires, rods, etc., practically go into a factory at one end\r\nand come out at the other, fully machined and ready to go into the\r\nassembly of a machine. Cylinder boring, all with one operation, takes\r\nthe place of operations that required many hours. Progressive types\r\nof assembly of the finished components of the cars make factories look\r\nlike the \xe2\x80\x9clast words in manufacturing.\xe2\x80\x9d Machining crankcases and work\r\nof that nature that required hours, is done in minutes. Aluminum, that\r\nmagic metal of the early days of the automobile industry, when it was\r\ncomparatively cheap, now enters so largely into engine and other parts\r\nthat at its greatly increased price it is more than a magic metal. It\r\nis no uncommon thing to find in an automobile factory that a machine\r\ncosting more than one hundred times the maker\xe2\x80\x99s cost of an automobile,\r\nhas been installed to hasten production.\r\n\r\nIn all the field of manufacturing there has not been wrought such magic\r\nas in gear cutting. Forges pound out tons of steel forms, but the most\r\nimportant machinery of a plant soon has these forms turned into gears\r\nand other machined parts for the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe medium priced car of today stands as the best exemplification\r\nof the approval of the Society of Automobile Engineers. This is an\r\norganization that has done so much for the manufacturer that most of\r\nthe makers of cars are members. They point to the self-starter and\r\nthe electric lighted car as the triumph of the Society of Automobile\r\nEngineers. And certainly from the original starter and the early\r\nlighting effects, enormous strides have been made in the industry.\r\nFully equipped cars predominate now, where only a few years ago even\r\ntops were not provided with the car as sold on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe self-starter is considered one of the greatest of the improvements\r\nadded to a good automobile. With this feature the car has become so\r\nuseful to women that the manufacturers have realized big returns.\r\nBetter than that, say some critics, is the verdict that the\r\nself-starter returned\xe2\x80\x94the chauffeur is no longer an indispensible\r\nfeature in car driving. Women master the handling of a car and with\r\nthe machines requiring less mechanical attention, one might say, every\r\nseason, woman accepts the gasoline car as her own. The number of\r\nwomen drivers has grown so wonderfully that the makers of cars have\r\nregistered the woman driver as a constant factor. There\xe2\x80\x99s no cranking\r\nof the car necessary, and the wearing of fine raiment and white shoes\r\nis Milady\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative, even if she drives her car to the party\r\nherself. She handles a multi-cylinder car quite as readily and with\r\nthe confidence of a man. The tires, always a problem, have demountable\r\nrims, or they may be set in spare wire wheels, and troubles on the road\r\nfrom blowouts and punctures no longer deter the woman driver. It would\r\nbe difficult to get the details on the number of women drivers added to\r\nthe list each season, but one of the best known automobile makers says\r\nthat it is so large that he would make his fortune safe if he only made\r\ncars henceforth for women pilots. The entrance of the woman in such an\r\nimportant manner in the automobile driving situation has made the gas\r\ncar maker lose all fear of the greater development of the electric car.\r\nWoman has played an important part in the real estate world, distinctly\r\ndue to her eagerness to drive cars, by starting a movement towards\r\nsuburbs. The suburbs are \xe2\x80\x9cfarther out and yet closer\xe2\x80\x9d as one maker put\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD ROADS INDUSTRY\xe2\x80\x99S GREATEST AID.\r\n\r\nWhen the full effect of the work of good roads advocates is felt in\r\nthis country, and regular appropriations are to be available in a\r\nregularly scheduled manner in most of the states, the biggest thing\r\nthe automobile industry ever had to help it will have taken up its\r\ntask in earnest. Less than ten per cent of the roads in this country\r\nare improved, say the good roads statisticians. One says that at least\r\ntwo-thirds of the reasons for present road developments are automobile\r\nreasons. When the proportion rises and the Lincoln Highway and scores\r\nof other long distance highways, intended to add to the cross country\r\ntouring practice, are made into complete roads that make for genuine\r\ntouring pleasure, the automobile industry will reap great benefits\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nthan the most enthusiastic ever dreamed would come from concrete, brick\r\nand other forms of specially prepared highways.\r\n\r\nThe war? Makers have varied opinions on the effect of the termination\r\nof the war in Europe. A majority have expressed the opinion that our\r\nexports of trucks and pleasure cars will take a big jump soon after\r\npeace is declared. But seeking for a peace after the years of warfare\r\nhas become the least of the American auto maker\xe2\x80\x99s trouble. Great war\r\norders have been received and filled by the American makers of trucks.\r\nIn 1914-15 the war orders rose to 14,000 trucks, as compared with only\r\n784 in the season 1913-14. War orders still are being filled by some\r\nAmerican truck makers, or were until the \xe2\x80\x9cruthless submarine warfare\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbroke out anew, and after millions of dollars worth of the old models\r\nbought up in the United States and absorbed by the European powers had\r\nbeen swallowed in the mystery of the continent, United States truck\r\nmakers began on later design models. In that way they are able to admit\r\nthat the war has been a great blessing to the motor truck feature of\r\nthe industry. \xe2\x80\x9cAll a part of the great scheme of economics that makes\r\nfor the approach of the complete automobilization of the country,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nthe way one manufacturer puts it.\r\n\r\nThe automobile industry is set\xe2\x80\x94it is fourth in importance in the United\r\nStates. It will handle itself, so to speak. The makers know they must\r\ngive value for every car and truck they build, and the people have\r\nbecome ready to continue in the industry every maker who plays the\r\nindustry as it should be\xe2\x80\x94not as a \xe2\x80\x9cgame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL EVOLUTION OF THE AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of every advance toward greater perfection in the\r\nachievements of mankind, whether moral or physical, has been one of\r\nslow and laborious development.\r\n\r\nWe speak carelessly of the wonderful advance the automobile has made in\r\na short time.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it has taken the automobile a hundred and fifty\r\nyears to arrive mechanically at the point it has reached today.\r\n\r\nWe thought the development of the motor car was speedy, but we find\r\nthat the measure of time required for its evolution, when put beside\r\nthe span of human history, lengthens as the shadows grow longer in the\r\ndying day.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing what stages this development has had to pass through,\r\nwhat problems have confronted it, and what apparently insuperable\r\nobstacles it has had to overcome.\r\n\r\nIn the light which our knowledge of the automobile now sheds on the\r\npresent day mechanism of this invention, it is difficult for us to\r\nrealize why these persistent struggles toward development of the\r\nmechanical ideas summoned to the aid of the inventors did not produce\r\nspeedier results.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly conceive as we look upon the perfect limousine, skimming\r\nover the smooth asphalt with a motion that contains no more vibration\r\nthan that in the glide of the expert ice skater, the crudeness,\r\ncumbersomeness and racking joltiness of its first forbear, which was\r\nthe original expression of the mechanical idea involved in making\r\nwheels revolve by a motive power other than that exercised by man, the\r\nbullock or the horse.\r\n\r\nIf we want to relieve our minds of the strain of comprehending the\r\ndifference between the automobile de luxe, as we of today know it,\r\nand the first automobile ever produced, and, by putting the two\r\npictures side by side, span the period of the development of the art of\r\nautomobile making, we must journey to Paris.\r\n\r\nFor, although internal combustion to drive a piston in a cylinder was\r\nproduced with gun-powder in 1678 by Abbe D\xe2\x80\x99Hautefeuille, and a carriage\r\nto be driven without the horse was a chaise propelled by human foot\r\nwork, first conceived by John Vevers of England in 1769, there is no\r\nrecord that the two ideas were combined until it was done in France\r\nsomewhere between 1760 and 1770.\r\n\r\nThe first automobile ever made was that produced by Nicholas Joseph\r\nCugnot, a Frenchman, and it is today on exhibition in the Conservatory\r\nof Arts and Trades in Paris.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of how Cugnot came to conceive the idea of his\r\ninvention, but it is surmised that he had read about James Watt, in\r\nEngland, having discovered the principle of steam as motive power. This\r\nwas about 1755.\r\n\r\nThe history of Watt\xe2\x80\x99s experiments in applying steam to run engines does\r\nnot, however, disclose that any engines he produced were ever seen by\r\nCugnot, or that any adequate description of them was published at the\r\ntime when Cugnot could have taken advantage of it.\r\n\r\nSo all we may actually know of Cugnot\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for thinking he\r\ncould make an \xe2\x80\x9canimalless\xe2\x80\x9d road vehicle is locked up in the rickety\r\ncentury-and-a-half-old Cugnot invention which we may see in the Paris\r\nConservatory.\r\n\r\nAnd what we would see would be:\r\n\r\nAn object which might make us laugh, did we not soberly reflect, in the\r\nlight of our superior knowledge of today, that it was the first step in\r\nthe long, laborious journey, extending over 157 years, that inventors\r\nhad to travel to produce our luxurious limousine, our satisfying\r\ntouring car and our terrifying speed demon of the oval racing course.\r\n\r\nCugnot\xe2\x80\x99s body returned to dust 113 years ago, but his idea went\r\nmarching on.\r\n\r\nThe visible expression of this idea which we can see in the Paris\r\nConservatory is in the form of a tractor for a field gun, Cugnot having\r\nbeen a captain in the engineering corps of the French army.\r\n\r\nThe tractor has a single drive wheel actuated by two single acting\r\nbrass cylinders, connected by an iron steam pipe with a round boiler of\r\ncopper containing fire pot and chimneys.\r\n\r\nAttached to this first motor-driven road vehicle is a wagon, on which\r\nit was Cugnot\xe2\x80\x99a idea to have a field gun mounted.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the single drive wheel of this clumsy contrivance are\r\nlocated ratchet wheels. Pistons acting alternately on these ratchet\r\nwheels revolved the drive wheel in quarter revolutions.\r\n\r\nFor the copper boiler of this first motor car, additional water was\r\nneeded after the machine had travelled a few feet, the exhaust of\r\nsteam quickly leaving the boiler dry. The speed attained was very\r\nslow, by reason of the mechanical complications in transmitting power\r\nto the drive wheel. As for running smoothly, the machine wobbled, and\r\nbumped, and strained, and groaned, and finally ran into a wall. This\r\nwas because it was overbalanced by its boiler and engine and had no\r\nsteering gear.\r\n\r\nHaving run into a wall and been partially wrecked, that was the end\r\nof the forerunner of the automobile, except for its subsequent rescue\r\nfrom a junk heap and its installation in the Paris Conservatory; for,\r\ndisheartened by what he regarded as his failure to make a successful\r\nsteam-driven tractor to relieve men and other animals of the burden\r\nof transporting field guns, Cugnot turned his attention to devising a\r\ncavalry gun, at which he was so successful that when he died in 1804 he\r\nwas enjoying a pension of 1,000 livres a year, given him by Napoleon.\r\n\r\nCugnot could not, of course, have visioned what his first crude\r\nautomobile would develop into in the next century and a half. He\r\nprobably never thought of a car holding seven passengers\xe2\x80\x94much less of a\r\nspeed for it of 60 miles an hour and more. In truth, since he abandoned\r\nhis efforts, he probably concluded the obstacles in the way of even a\r\npractical fulfillment of his idea were insurmountable.\r\n\r\nThe one fact remains to keep company with the Cugnot motor tractor\r\nin the Conservatory of Paris, that Cugnot was the father of the idea\r\nout of which the automobile was evolved. He was the first to invent a\r\nmotor-driven road vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH MAKE AUTOMOBILES ALMOST PRACTICABLE.\r\n\r\nThe English people have an enviable record for successful mechanical\r\ninventions, and they were early experimenters on lines similar to those\r\nof Cugnot. About the time that Cugnot ran his machine into a wall,\r\nWilliam Murdock, a mechanic, was working for Watt, the English inventor\r\nof steam. Whether he knew of Cugnot\xe2\x80\x99s automobile attempt or not, there\r\nis no evidence extant. The idea of an engine-run road contrivance may\r\nhave come to him through inspiration, or in some other way, as it did\r\nto Cugnot.\r\n\r\nMurdock was quite familiar with Watt\xe2\x80\x99s engines. He helped to build\r\nthem, and he was curious to know the different forms in which they\r\ncould be used, especially as to a road vehicle. He talked to Watt,\r\nbut was sternly discouraged by the latter. Just as Cugnot, no doubt,\r\nconcluded that his automobile would never get anywhere, Watt opposed\r\napplying his engine to a road travelling machine, because he was firmly\r\nconvinced that no vehicle that could be invented could successfully\r\nnegotiate, at a speed to make it worth while, the execrable roads of\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nIn this we have a fine illustration of the peculiarities and uncertain\r\nnature of the human mind. It is an organism that astounds by its\r\nperception of possibilities in one direction, while numb of any\r\nsensation whatever in glimpsing the possibilities in another direction.\r\n\r\nWatt could invent steam, but he could not imagine good roads. Had\r\nhe possessed the vision, he might have seen that roads, which he so\r\nabhorred as to see nothing good in them, would be reformed if he but\r\nencouraged applying his engines to road travelling mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn William Murdock\xe2\x80\x99s way of taking the doleful discouragement of Watt,\r\nwe see an illustration of that mental attitude that man has universally\r\nadopted in mechanical advance, toward the lugubrious prophet of\r\nfailure. He has matched hope and optimism against despair and pessimism.\r\n\r\nDespite Watt and his mournful views of the impossibility of building an\r\nengine-run road carriage that would advance over English roads, Murdock\r\nwent ahead and built a model of an engine-run road carriage; but when\r\nhe had it finished, Watt\xe2\x80\x99s discouraging views prevailed, and Murdock\r\ndid not attempt to enlarge his model to a full sized form. He stopped\r\nwith the model, which is at the present day in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nMurdock\xe2\x80\x99s invention was tested, and the tests showed that an advance\r\nin efficiency over the creation of Cugnot had been made. The model\r\nwas driven by a single cylinder of three inch bore. It had a one and\r\na half inch stroke. A crank converted the reciprocating motion of the\r\nsteam engine into rotary motion, the service performed in the Cugnot\r\ninvention by the quarter revolution ratchet drive. Murdock\xe2\x80\x99s idea was\r\npatented by a man named Pickard, in 1780.\r\n\r\nThe first automobile known to have been constructed and put on the road\r\nwas built by Richard Trevithick at Camborne, England, in 1801. It was\r\nin the form of a stage coach, accommodating six or seven persons. The\r\nengine, boiler and firebox were at the rear. The engine was one of the\r\nfirst high pressure engines. A single cylinder motor was employed, and\r\nspur gear and crank axle were used to transmit the motion of the piston\r\nrod to the drive wheels.\r\n\r\nWith this coach Trevithick carried six or seven men over hills for a\r\nmile the first day of the trial. The second day it made six miles. Even\r\nwith these performances, the invention\xe2\x80\x99s impracticability must have\r\nbeen decreed, because it was not continued in operation.\r\n\r\nTrevithick himself felt, no doubt, that it must be improved upon, for,\r\nin 1803, he built another contrivance driven by a horizontal single\r\ncylinder with 5-1/2-inch bore and a 30-inch stroke. But the driving\r\nwheels were ten feet in diameter. Fatal were these great clumsy wheels\r\nto popular approval of the invention, and no further advance was made.\r\nTrevithick had made one further step, and there the matter rested. He\r\nhad developed the high pressure steam engine, and he had really made\r\nthe first automobile, if such it could be called.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA\xe2\x80\x99S EARLY EFFORTS IN AUTOMOBILE MAKING.\r\n\r\nJust as the English, represented by Murdock and Trevithick, were\r\nlaboring on the steam propulsion idea, and France, in the person of\r\nCugnot, was experimenting with it, so America was groping to find the\r\nsolution. Cugnot\xe2\x80\x99s activities began about 1760 and ended with his\r\ndeath in 1804. Trevithick\xe2\x80\x99s period was from 1780 to 1803. The American\r\nexperiments started about 1784. The man whom records show to have been\r\nthe pioneer in practical excursions into the realm of carriages driven\r\nby steam, was Oliver Evans, born in Delaware but living in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHe developed the high pressure, non-condensing engine, although his\r\nonly knowledge of steam was derived from reading what little was then\r\nprinted about it, and his own discoveries. It appears as if Evans,\r\nwho is known to have had knowledge of Cugnot\xe2\x80\x99s construction of a\r\nroad carriage, or, more properly speaking, a gun carriage, connected\r\nin his mind his engine with a road travelling vehicle, because in\r\n1787, four years before Trevithick built his steam coach at Camborne,\r\nEngland, Evans secured a patent from the State of Maryland, giving him\r\nthe exclusive right to make and use, within its borders, carriages\r\npropelled by steam.\r\n\r\nThat he immediately built a steam carriage in pursuance of this\r\nauthority is doubtful. The only authentic record of an attempt is of\r\none that he constructed in Philadelphia seven years later and under\r\npeculiar circumstances. It is likely that his act in securing the\r\nMaryland patent was done on the spur of a determination to build\r\nan automobile, but it was not immediately carried out. He went on\r\nperfecting steam engines up to 1804, when he accepted an order from the\r\ncity of Philadelphia to build a steam flat boat for dock work.\r\n\r\nHis mind appears to have then reverted back to the time seven years\r\nbefore when he contemplated applying an engine to a road vehicle and\r\ngot the Maryland patent for that purpose, for, after building the steam\r\nflatboat and installing a 5-horse power engine on it, he announced his\r\nintention of mounting the flatboat on a wagon, on which he proposed to\r\ndrive the boat about Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nA horseless carriage, no doubt, had been a hobby with him for years,\r\nand he saw in the steam driven wagon, carrying a steam driven flatboat,\r\nan ocular demonstration of the practicability of the horseless carriage.\r\n\r\nThe four wheels of the wagon he built were connected by belts and\r\ngearing with the engine on the boat, and the vehicle was driven up\r\nMarket Street by steam, bearing the flatboat and its engine in triumph.\r\nIt circled the squares on which the City Hall and the statue of William\r\nPenn now stand, and proceeded to the Schuylkill river. Here flatboat\r\nand wagon were separated, and the former launched on the river. A\r\npaddle wheel was affixed to the stern and connected with the engine.\r\nThe boat ran as well as the wagon had done. It steamed down to the\r\nDelaware river and all the way to Trenton. The wagon, divorced of\r\nengine and gearing, became only a wagon again, and whatever became of\r\nit, history does not say.\r\n\r\nThe skepticism, the derogatory observations, the pessimistic prophecies\r\nand the contemptuous disapproval of the many persons witnessing the\r\nEvans\xe2\x80\x99 pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s progress up Market Street aroused the inventor\xe2\x80\x99s ire.\r\n\r\nHad he but been philosophical, he would have appreciated that such has\r\nbeen the fate and greeting of all inventions. But Evans was choleric.\r\nWhen a citizen said his wagon was only what might now be dubbed a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cflivver\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that it would never run over five miles an hour, and other\r\nthings that the minds of the unimaginative conceive of innovations,\r\nthe inventor drew from his wallet $3,000 that the city of Philadelphia\r\nhad just paid him for his steamboat, and said the carping critic could\r\ntransfer the \xe2\x80\x9croll\xe2\x80\x9d to his own pocket, if he could produce a horse that\r\nwould run faster for five miles than a steam wagon that Evans would\r\nbuild. The size of the roll was too much for the pessimist, and he\r\nbetook himself and his criticisms off.\r\n\r\nSo we see that as there was a first automobile, so was there a first\r\nautomobile enthusiast on automobile speed. Why it is that motordom\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t erected a monument to Oliver Evans for his abiding faith in the\r\nfuture of the motor car as a speed demon, is up to motordom to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMOBILE APATHY CENTURY OLD.\r\n\r\nOliver Evans tried but was unable to get any one interested in\r\ndeveloping his wagon run by an engine into an improved horseless\r\ncarriage. The minds of that day regarded the practicability of his\r\ninvention with as much skepticism as we would regard an invention to\r\nvisit Mars, if exhibited in our day.\r\n\r\nSo Evans gave up any idea of improving his self-running wagon, became\r\nbusy with an iron foundry which people could understand, and died rich.\r\n\r\nThere was a measure of justification for the lack of popular\r\nimagination and vision toward the automobile in both England and\r\nAmerica when the first samples appeared. They were slow, noisy, erratic\r\nin performance, and positively dangerous\xe2\x80\x94threatening explosions,\r\ncollisions, and all sorts of dire things\xe2\x80\x94and it was natural that people\r\nshould predict their failure.\r\n\r\nSo progress in the development of the horseless carriage lagged. It\r\nwas twenty years after Evans\xe2\x80\x99 Philadelphia exhibition when it was next\r\nheard from. Then the scene of operations shifted again to England.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, W. H. James, who had patented a water tube boiler for\r\nlocomotives, built a passenger coach, of which each drive wheel was\r\nrevolved by two cylinders receiving steam by means of a pipe from a\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nA pressure of 200 pounds of steam to the inch was maintained. The\r\nequivalent of differential action was supplied by independent\r\napplication of power to the two drive wheels. The coach accommodated\r\ntwenty persons. The contrivance ran satisfactorily on trials, and James\r\nsecured financial backing and built another coach weighing 6,000 pounds\r\nwhich ran 12 to 15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nBut the higher the rate of speed, the worse off the early automobile\r\nbuilder was. Although James equipped his coach with laminated steel\r\nsprings, the road shocks and vibration stopped it every few miles.\r\nSteam joints and connections were broken as fast as they could be\r\nput together. The great need was a method of shock absorption, and\r\neither no one knew that this was the key to the problem, or, if it\r\nwas realized, no one knew the remedy. So James failed to make the\r\nauto-coach a success, and died in the poorhouse.\r\n\r\nA year after James built his first motor-coach in England\xe2\x80\x94in\r\n1825\xe2\x80\x94Thomas Blanchard of Springfield, Mass., revived the horseless\r\ncarriage subject which, in America, had been last experimented with by\r\nOliver Evans in 1804.\r\n\r\nBlanchard built a road vehicle that was one of the best produced up to\r\nthat time. It was easy of manipulation and climbed hills successfully.\r\nBlanchard took out a patent on it, but when he started to find people\r\nwho would buy a completed carriage he could discover none. Nobody\r\nwanted it. And so Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s efforts ceased.\r\n\r\nAt the time James was building his two coaches, and after Blanchard had\r\ngiven up trying to interest Americans in his invention, a Frenchman\r\nnamed Pecqueur was experimenting on phases of the auto-carriage. He\r\ndiscovered the principle of the \xe2\x80\x9cdifferential,\xe2\x80\x9d the balance mechanism\r\nwhich enables one wheel to revolve faster than the other in turning\r\ncorners. He invented a planet gearing in this connection, which was\r\nthe origin of the idea of the differential, and applied it to a steam\r\nwagon which he built in 1828. The differential of today is based on the\r\nprinciple discovered by Pecqueur.\r\n\r\nWhile Pecqueur was evolving this invention, Goldsworthy Gurney in\r\nEngland made a car which was a practical failure in about everything\r\nexcept that it demonstrated that sufficient friction between the drive\r\nwheels and the road-bed could be created to produce propulsion. A trip\r\nof almost 200 miles from London and return was made in 1828 by Gurney\r\nin the second vehicle he built, in which the engine was concealed in\r\nthe rear. His car made 12 miles an hour for part of the trip.\r\n\r\nFrom this time\xe2\x80\x941828 to 1840\xe2\x80\x94the automobile really had a vogue in\r\nEngland. A number of them were made and run as passenger carriers. For\r\nfour months a motor carriage made the nine mile trip from Gloucester\r\nto Cheltenham four times a day. The \xe2\x80\x9cInfant\xe2\x80\x9d built by Walter Hancock\r\nmade trips between London and Stratford. The \xe2\x80\x9cEra,\xe2\x80\x9d also made by\r\nHancock, ran from London to Greenwich. To such an extent did the\r\nauto-bus business develop, that speed of 30 miles an hour was claimed,\r\nand one conveyance in 1834 ran over 1,700 miles without repairs or\r\nreadjustment. At least, that was the claim made, and as a claim it has\r\na familiar sound. The twentieth century automobile manufacturers who\r\nclaim a run of so many thousand miles without repairs to this and that,\r\nhave here a precedent for it that is as old as the industry.\r\n\r\nBut there was one feature about these early English motor busses that\r\nwas their undoing. They weighed three tons and over, and the wheel rims\r\nwere metal. The diameter of the wheels was six feet. The rubber tire\r\nwas unthought of. The effect on roads of running a 3-ton, metal rimmed\r\nvehicle, carrying eleven to twenty passengers, was disastrous, and\r\nparliament, incited by horse owners and others, legislated them out of\r\nexistence by making the toll charges prohibitive. Where the toll was\r\n$1 for horse drawn vehicles it was made $10 for steam auto buses. The\r\nconsequence was that their manufacture and operation ceased about 1840.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Bollee built a steam omnibus which ran between Paris and\r\nVienna, making 22 miles an hour. In this car was reached the highest\r\nefficiency the art had attained up to that time. Practically an\r\nidentical car was built in 1880 by Bollee, which was entered by him 15\r\nyears later and won honors in the Paris-Bordeaux race.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the automobile development germ returned to America.\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch showing the struggle of auto-mechanism to advance,\r\nfrom the very first inspiration of Cugnot about 1770, we must be\r\nimpressed by the determination with which the idea of auto-mechanical\r\nperfection persisted. This persistence was so determined in the face of\r\nall obstacles and opposition that it is almost eerie.\r\n\r\nIt was just as if some force of nature was struggling to break through\r\nthe crust of man\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness. Or shall we credit it to man, and\r\nsay, rather, that it was man\xe2\x80\x99s mind that was the impelling force in the\r\npersistent attempts to read a mechanical riddle?\r\n\r\nWhatever the impelling force, whether man or nature, man heeded its\r\nbehests and continued his efforts.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 an American did a thing which has had much to do with giving\r\nthe United States its long delayed start in the automobile industry.\r\nThis man was George B. Selden of Rochester, N. Y. He applied for the\r\nfirst patent for the gasoline motor, as the driving force of a road\r\nvehicle. This was before any automobile had been equipped with an\r\ninternal combustion hydro-carbon motor. This motor had, however, been\r\nin use for some time in running stationary engines.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle had, at that time, been an acknowledged success, and in\r\nconsiderable use for seven or eight years, and had had a great deal of\r\ninfluence in improving roads. Better roads caused people to look more\r\nfavorably on the possibilities of the motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nSelden built a gasoline motor under the specifications contained in\r\nhis application for a patent, and it performed satisfactorily in\r\nexperiments. But he did not build an automobile containing the gasoline\r\nmotor. He did not secure his patent until 1895, 16 years after he had\r\nmade application for it.\r\n\r\nIn those sixteen years he was endeavoring to interest capital, while at\r\nthe same time he was perfecting his motor. While the use of bicycles\r\nhad improved roads and this improvement caused a more favorable popular\r\nview of the possibility that automobiles might be made successfully, a\r\nnew motive power appeared on the horizon just at this time.\r\n\r\nIt was electricity. It was in 1890, eleven years after Selden had\r\napplied for a patent for a gasoline motor, and while he was still\r\nwrestling with the problem of getting capital to aid him, that reports\r\nthat the storage battery had been more nearly perfected became rife.\r\n\r\nMen to whom Selden went for financial aid feared that even if the\r\ngasoline motor was feasible, it might be overshadowed by the storage\r\nbattery, and held off. Selden even went abroad to raise money, but had\r\nno more success there than here.\r\n\r\nAlthough an inventor and a skilled mechanic, Selden lacked salesmanship\r\nability. He was handicapped by impatience and irascibility, and his\r\npredictions of the success of his gasoline motor, its general adoption,\r\nand the extent to which automobiles would in the future be used, were\r\nregarded by people with whom he talked as so extravagant that they\r\nbluntly declared he was crazy, and avoided him.\r\n\r\nHe had proceeded so far on one occasion in interesting a Rochester\r\nbusiness man, that he had him in his store and was on the point of\r\ngetting him to put up $5,000, when he made a simple remark that\r\ncompletely \xe2\x80\x9cspilled the beans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cJim, you and I will live to see more carriages on Main Street\r\nrun by motor than are now drawn by horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prospective investor looked at Selden for half a minute, and came\r\nto a conclusion expressed in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, you are crazy, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with your\r\nscheme,\xe2\x80\x9d and with this ultimatum the man stalked out of the store.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later this man met Selden, and, extending his hand,\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, George, you were right years ago when you said there would\r\nbe more automobiles in Main Street than horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Selden ignored the man\xe2\x80\x99s extended hand, and with passion thrilling\r\nin his tones said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 crazy as you and the other\r\nfools said I was,\xe2\x80\x9d and walked off. And he never spoke to the man\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s patent could have been issued any time within the sixteen\r\nyears that he let it lie dormant. He kept the application alive at the\r\npatent office by legitimate methods, and his reason for not bringing\r\nthe matter to a head was that at no time in those sixteen years was he\r\nready to manufacture under it, and he put off the actual issuance until\r\nsuch time as he was prepared to take full advantage of the privileges\r\nit conferred.\r\n\r\nHe was alive to the fact that the years of a patent are numbered, and\r\nhe aimed to time the issue so that the patent would not expire before\r\nhe could derive the benefits from it.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1895 that the patent was issued, and in 1900 Selden disposed\r\nof it to the Electric Vehicle Company of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the development of electric motor vehicles had begun,\r\nand in 1885, Benz, a German, built the first road vehicle to be run\r\nby the internal-combustion, hydro-carbon motor. It was a tricycle,\r\nand its motor was single-cylindered, four-cycled, after the type of\r\nan engine developed in 1876, in Germany, by Otto, and water cooled.\r\nIt had electric ignition and a mechanical carburetor. Benz secured\r\na patent in 1886 on his invention and it ran successfully, making\r\nten miles an hour. Benz was limited to the use of certain streets in\r\nMannheim, Germany, for running his machine, out of deference to the\r\ntendency to nerves of horses and their drivers or riders. This tricycle\r\nby Benz was the forerunner of the Benz automobile. This is one of the\r\nmost successful and popular cars in Germany\xe2\x80\x94and before the war, in all\r\nEurope. The first automobile imported into the United States was a Benz\r\ncar brought to the Chicago World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair in 1893. Up to 1917 the Benz\r\ncar was an entrant in most automobile speed contests.\r\n\r\nWhile Benz was perfecting the gasoline motor in its attachment to the\r\ntricycle, Gottlieb Daimler, another German, was producing, in 1885, the\r\nmotor-cycle. Daimler had devoted himself sedulously to the problem\r\nof reducing the weight and increasing the power of the gas engine, in\r\norder to adapt it to high efficiency road vehicles. He invented the hot\r\ntube ignition to take the place of ignition by flame. By regulation of\r\nthe heat of the tube, the compressed charge of hydro-carbon vapor could\r\nbe fired automatically at a specific point in the cycle. Through the\r\nincreased speed thus produced the size and weight of the motor could be\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nThe Daimler motor was a big step in advance, as was proved by the\r\nsupremacy which the German and French automobile makers at once\r\nattained. The French secured rights to the Daimler motor and operated\r\nunder them with such success that from 1889 to 1894, before the United\r\nStates had really waked up to motor car making, they were beginning to\r\nput out gasoline automobiles successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA BUILDS STEAM AND ELECTRIC CARS.\r\n\r\nAt this time, we, in this country, were following the steam and storage\r\nbattery fetishes. The first steam car in the United States that might\r\nbe called modern was built by S. H. Roper of Massachusetts, in 1889.\r\nIn 1900, steam car building in America gave promise of disputing the\r\ngasoline car records then being made in France, but by 1905 the\r\ngasoline car manufacturers had taken the cue from the European gasoline\r\nsuccesses, and this form of motor came to the front.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the activities in steam car building in the\r\nUnited States, was the pioneer electric car construction era.\r\n\r\nThe first electric automobile was built in 1891, and made its first\r\nexhibition appearance in the streets of Chicago in September, 1892.\r\nThe builder of this, the first electric driven vehicle, was William\r\nMorrison of Des Moines, Iowa. It was bought by J. B. McDonald,\r\npresident of the American Battery Company, Chicago. Description of\r\nthe street scenes attending the showing of this car bring home to us\r\nthe extent to which an automobile was a novelty so short a time ago,\r\ncomparatively, as 1892. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since its arrival,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _Western\r\nElectrician_ of September 17, 1892, \xe2\x80\x9cit has attracted the greatest\r\nattention. The sight of a well loaded carriage moving along the streets\r\nat a spanking pace, with no horses in front, and apparently with\r\nnothing on board to give it motion, was one that has been too much,\r\neven for the wide-awake Chicagoan. In passing through the business\r\nsection, way had to be cleared by the police for the passage of the\r\ncarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo think that this description fits a scene enacted during the period\r\nof the present generation! Eighty-eight years before in Philadelphia,\r\nOliver Evans\xe2\x80\x99 steam propelled wagon, bearing in triumph a flatboat\r\nsurmounted by an engine, moved along Market Street with no horses in\r\nfront, and was a sight that was too much for the Philadelphian.\r\n\r\nThe world \xe2\x80\x9cdo move,\xe2\x80\x9d but very slowly, and this 88-year span of time\r\nis practically the measure of the period consumed by automobile\r\ndevelopment to the point where a motor carriage would really run, and\r\nkeep on running.\r\n\r\nThe date of the building of the first American gasoline automobile that\r\nran was 1892. The man who performed the feat was Charles E. Duryea. He\r\nhad the assistance of his brother, Frank Duryea, but what was more, he\r\nhad the benefit of knowledge of what had been accomplished in Europe in\r\nthe gasoline motor field.\r\n\r\nPanhard, Levassor, Peugeot, De Dion, Bouton, and Serpollet were\r\nFrenchmen who had done things with gasoline cars, all (except Serpollet\r\nand Levassor) principally through the manufacture of finished cars.\r\nLevassor conceived the idea of a central frame to carry the power\r\nplant, and thus solved the problem of road shock.\r\n\r\nSerpollet had done more. He had invented the flash boiler, reviving an\r\nart the English had previously discovered, which made the use of dry\r\nor superheated steam possible. Higher pressure could be used, water\r\neconomies effected and weight reduced.\r\n\r\nWhen Duryea and others, about 1892, gave concentrated thought to\r\ngasoline propulsion, all the problems of automobile making had found\r\nsolution, except two. They were a method of cushioning wheel rims, and\r\nsome method by which the motor could be so placed that it would be\r\nimmune from shocks and vibrations.\r\n\r\nSo, when Duryea, in 1892, built the first American gasoline car that\r\nwould run successfully, he merely \xe2\x80\x9cassembled\xe2\x80\x9d the ideas that had then\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\nThe first auto-race in the world was run from Paris to Rouen, about 80\r\nmiles. It was run in July, 1894. There were 46 cars entered, of which\r\ntwelve only were steam cars. The Petit-Journal, a Parisian newspaper,\r\nwas the organizer and patron of the race. The winners were all equipped\r\nwith the Daimler gasoline motor.\r\n\r\nA little over one year later\xe2\x80\x94Thanksgiving Day, 1895\xe2\x80\x94the first American\r\nautomobile race was run from Chicago to Waukegan. The organizer and\r\npatron was a newspaper\xe2\x80\x94the Chicago Times-Herald. Of two entrants, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuggyaut\xe2\x80\x9d of Charles E. Duryea was one.\r\n\r\nDuryea built his first car in 1892.\r\n\r\nHenry Ford built his in 1893.\r\n\r\nElwood Haynes built his in 1894.\r\n\r\nThere were but four gasoline cars in the United States in 1896\xe2\x80\x94Duryea,\r\nFord, Haynes, and Benz, the last being the German car which was\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nWith the accomplishments of the builders of steam, electric and\r\ngasoline motored vehicles at this time\xe2\x80\x941895\xe2\x80\x94the practical success\r\nof horseless carriages had been definitely settled. Practically all\r\nfundamental problems had been solved. To make them finally an accepted\r\naddition to the world\xe2\x80\x99s methods of transportation in general use, two\r\nthings only were needed.\r\n\r\nOne was the development of perfecting devices, such as rubber tires,\r\nthe production of which began about 1889; and the other was the general\r\nacceptance of automobiles by the people\xe2\x80\x94a cordial, popular approval,\r\nmanifested by their purchase and use. And while the development to\r\ngreater perfection could be left to work itself out, the popular\r\napproval to the point of enthusiastic general adoption was another\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nInventors could develop, even if it took over a hundred years, a\r\ncomplete, perfect machine, finally. But human doubts, mental apathy,\r\nand man\xe2\x80\x99s opposition can be overcome by only one means\xe2\x80\x94enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm is to man\xe2\x80\x99s opposing mind what the oxyhydrogen flame is to\r\nsteel, and it is one of the potent forces that will burn itself into\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\nAround the period of 1893-1898, the attitude of the mass of the\r\npeople in this country toward the automobile was one of good natured\r\ntoleration, but indifference. A few of the \xe2\x80\x9cclass\xe2\x80\x9d were interested and\r\nconvinced that the automobile had arrived, but the \xe2\x80\x9cmass\xe2\x80\x9d believed it\r\nwas a passing fad, and from its practical side, of particular interest\r\nchiefly to mechanics. If, in its opinion, the automobile had any\r\nfuture, it was as a luxury of the rich.\r\n\r\nThe people could not sense what they feel now\xe2\x80\x94the value of the\r\nautomobile in time, health and recreation, and in its possibilities\r\nas a factor in economics. They saw the disadvantages of owning an\r\nautomobile, but were without appreciation of its benefits.\r\n\r\nSo one of the most interesting facts in the history of the development\r\nof the motor car is that the first American made gasoline automobile\r\nsold in the United States was disposed of March 24,1898. The sale of\r\nsteamers and electrics had been going on for several years before, but\r\nnot very extensively.\r\n\r\nThis fact of the date of the first sale of a gasoline motor car fixes\r\nclearly that the use of automobiles in the United States practically\r\nincreased from one car to over three million, in less than twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe first American gasoline car thus sold was disposed of by Alexander\r\nWinton to Robert Allison of Port Carbon, Pa.\r\n\r\nSo that, while Duryea completed his car in 1892, Ford his in 1893, and\r\nHaynes his in 1894, it was six, five and four years, respectively,\r\nlater, that the first gasoline car was purchased in the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom 1898, the time of the sale of the Winton car, dates substantially\r\nthe development of the automobile industry in this country.\r\n\r\nBeginning with this date, the first real enthusiasm was put into the\r\nsale of cars.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm had not existed before. Confidence, which is the mother of\r\nenthusiasm, had hesitated and halted. But now confidence believed the\r\nautomobile was a reality\xe2\x80\x94all doubts had been resolved\xe2\x80\x94and confidence\r\nbade enthusiasm run, not creep, crawl or walk; and we see how\r\nenthusiasm obeyed. In the enthusiasm displayed in the manufacture and\r\nsale of automobiles today, we are disposed to think it does more than\r\nrun, that it actually flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIALIZING THE MOTOR VEHICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the production of the automobile, America did comparatively little\r\nin the fundamentals of invention which are now found in the modern\r\nperfected car.\r\n\r\nSelden invented the three-cylinder gasoline engine, by which the rapid\r\nrevolution of the crankshaft of his day was converted into slower but\r\nhigher powered motion of drive wheels.\r\n\r\nWhite invented a generator for steam cars.\r\n\r\nHaynes was responsible for a discovery that caused alloy and specially\r\nheat-treated steel to be introduced, and Knight produced a superior\r\nmotor.\r\n\r\nBut these were discoveries, inventions or improvements that were\r\nsupplemental and perfecting, not elemental.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly the English, the French and the Germans, with the\r\nexception of Evans of Philadelphia, who first conceived the idea of the\r\nhorseless carriage, and helped it to its final development by a series\r\nof successive inventions. The names of Cugnot, Trevithick, James,\r\nPecqueur, Hancock, Gurney, Lenoir, Bollee, Benz, Daimler, Levassor and\r\nSerpollet should form the nomenclative setting of commemorative friezes\r\non the walls of the grateful motor clubs of the future, as those of\r\nLiszt, Beethoven, Wagner, Gounod, Handel, Massenet, Bach, Mendelssohn,\r\nGrieg and Chopin take honored place in the shrines of Music, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cheavenly maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven in the production of automobiles in any quantity for use\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncommercializing of the idea they represent\xe2\x80\x94the United States did not\r\nlead at first. This honor belongs to France, as does the original\r\nconception by Cugnot of the horseless vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe first steam cars manufactured in the United States, on any basis\r\nentitling their manufacture to the dignity of a business, were made\r\nafter 1894, and the names of Riker, White and Stanley are the prominent\r\nones in the steam automobile field. Electric carriages were sold as\r\ncommercial commodities in comparatively small quantities, beginning\r\nwith 1897, and the first American gasoline car sold in the United\r\nStates was made and sold by Alexander Winton in 1898.\r\n\r\nBeginning prior to 1892, the French were selling automobiles by the\r\nhundred, while manufacturers in America were selling them by the dozen.\r\nPanhard and Peugeot were selling gasoline cars, and DeDion-Bouton was\r\nputting the steam automobile on the world\xe2\x80\x99s market.\r\n\r\nBut the race is not always to the swiftest. While France started\r\nbravely on its commercialization of the automobile, and had in its\r\nfavor what were then good roads of an old and well settled country to\r\nrun them over, and perhaps the thriftiest people of any nation to buy\r\nthem, there were causes existing in the United States destined to make\r\nof it the greatest automobile producing country in the world, and its\r\npeople the largest users of the new invention, while at the same time\r\noperating to cause the United States to sell more cars outside its\r\nconfines, to Europe and elsewhere, than are sold by any other country.\r\n\r\nAnd inasmuch as these underlying causes, while explaining the\r\nsupremacy of this country to this date in the manufacture and sale of\r\nautomobiles, also explain the reason for believing that the future of\r\nthe automobile business will dwarf the proportions it has up to this\r\ntime reached, they will bear analysis.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, European manufacturers of automobiles, as well as\r\nof other products generally, with the possible exception in a degree,\r\nof the Germans, are bound hand and foot, and therefore handicapped,\r\nby tradition and convention. They make the automobile, especially the\r\nFrench and English, so solidly, with such fidelity to tradition and\r\nwith such conscientious care as to detail, elaboration and finish,\r\nthat the price to the buyer, when it is put beside that of a similar\r\nAmerican made product, will not meet competition.\r\n\r\nThe American has a knack of turning out an article which is\r\nmechanically correct, has the wearing qualities, but is simpler in\r\ndetail, and hence can be sold at a lower cost. Simplicity is the\r\nAmerican manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s keynote.\r\n\r\nBack of this is business organization system, standardization of\r\nparts used in the automobile, and that high order of constructive and\r\nexecutive talent that gives the American business man the distinctive\r\nreputation he enjoys and enables him successfully to compete in\r\nprice and quality with the rest of the world. There has been a rare\r\ncombination of inventive and business abilities in American automobile\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nAmerican mechanical genius has been given great credit, but wherein\r\nis it any greater than that of the German, French or English? In one\r\nparticular\xe2\x80\x94its simplicity. The Europeans are elaborate\xe2\x80\x94the Americans\r\nplain and simple.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that no European manufacturer would have conceived an\r\nautomobile embodying the essentials of small size, simplicity and\r\nspeed represented by a Ford car. His tradition and training would have\r\nimpelled him to elaboration in size and finish. In this, he is, of\r\ncourse, moulded by European needs and tastes which differ, in many\r\nrespects, from those of the people of this country.\r\n\r\nHe does not possess the American\xe2\x80\x99s practical vision in successful\r\nsalesmanship. Ford made his car with an eye to quantity. He was not\r\nonly an inventor, but a salesman. As he worked on his motor, he worked\r\non the problems of sales\xe2\x80\x94producing a car that would sell to the largest\r\nnumber. The larger the number sold, the smaller the price could be made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge sales and small profits\xe2\x80\x9d has been a principle which has made\r\nmany American fortunes. Note how this same idea of Ford has been\r\nfollowed by Willys in the Overland, Olds in the Reo, the makers of the\r\nMaxwell, and half a score of other manufacturers in varying degrees,\r\ncausing the gamut of prices of the most popular cars to run from $360\r\nto $1,200 each.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why the American car could invade England and her\r\ndominions beyond the seas, why Ford has factories in the British Isles\r\nand Canada, and why our yearly exports of automobiles have increased in\r\nthe last five years over $100,000,000 in value.\r\n\r\nOther reasons that make us an exporting country of automobiles through\r\ntheir low prices are our natural resources of iron, steel, lumber, coal\r\nand alloys, enabling us, by their plentifulness and accessibility, to\r\nmanufacture at cheap cost, thus offsetting the higher price we pay for\r\nlabor in this country than the European manufacturers pay.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest factor in the lead which the United States has taken\r\nin the production of automobiles, both for export and consumption\r\nwithin her own borders, is the universal method of standardizing in\r\nmanufacture, adopted by the automobile producers of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers of this country shine in the field of cost\r\nproduction, in the economies of purchase of raw materials, in the\r\nmethod of manufacture, and in marketing their product.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISING\xe2\x80\x99S HELP IN MAKING THE AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which economic methods of purchase of raw\r\nmaterials\xe2\x80\x94getting the price down\xe2\x80\x94economic standardization of\r\nmanufacture, inventing short cuts as it were\xe2\x80\x94affects production cost,\r\nis shown in the fact that the automobile industry ranks almost at the\r\ntop in the manufactures of the United States in the per cent of value\r\nadded by manufacture to the cost of material.\r\n\r\nThe per cent of value added by manufacture to cost of material in\r\nautomobile production is 71 per cent, against 66 per cent in cotton\r\ngoods, 55 per cent in iron and steel products, 51 per cent in boots\r\nand shoes, 16 per cent in flour and grist mill products, and 12 per\r\ncent in slaughtering and meat packing.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may sound when first stated, advertising is primarily the\r\nbase of this result. We know that the first principle of lowered cost\r\nis buying in quantities; that if we buy for 100, the cost for each is\r\nlower than the cost for one; if for 1,000 it is lower than the cost for\r\neach of 100, and so on.\r\n\r\nSo, when Ford buys the materials for 533,921 cars, which was the\r\nnumber he sold in 1916, he gets the price of the cost of each of these\r\nmore than a half million cars down to a less price than if he bought\r\nmaterial for 1,708 cars, the number he made in 1904, or even 168,220,\r\nthe number he made in 1913.\r\n\r\nThis is patent to any one who ever heard of wholesale and retail prices.\r\n\r\nBut how did Ford find a sale for 533,921 cars in 1916?\r\n\r\nBy advertising.\r\n\r\nThe first thing a manufacturer must do to lower the cost of production\r\nof the single unit is to make in quantities.\r\n\r\nHow to insure the disposal of that quantity has been the big problem\r\nthat American automobile manufacturers have had to solve. The solution\r\nwas at hand. It was advertising. The commercializing of automobiles\r\nwith the speed and to the extent to which it was done between 1900 and\r\n1917 could not have been successfully accomplished before this period,\r\nbecause the recognition of the value of advertising had not become\r\nwidespread up to that time.\r\n\r\nAdvertising had gone through a process of development that was as slow\r\nas that of the automobile business. Both arts emerged from darkness\r\ninto light at about the same time. Here is evidence that a very bright\r\nand smart set of men engaged in automobile production at the very\r\noutset.\r\n\r\nThey were mechanical, they were versed in business methods, and they\r\nwere conscious of the value of advertising.\r\n\r\nThis combination of knowledge by the men engaged in it has made the\r\nautomobile industry a record breaker in point of the time consumed\r\nin its development. It has made it stand out as unparalleled by any\r\nother industry in this country in the speed with which it progressed\r\nfrom final experimentation to an established recognized enterprise,\r\ninvolving mammoth investment of capital and huge profits.\r\n\r\nThat the automobile business has been the most extensively advertised\r\nbusiness of any in which we are engaged, almost anyone will concede\r\nfrom knowledge gained from his own observation.\r\n\r\nAdvertising is like the rainbow\xe2\x80\x94many hued. It may be one form, or\r\nit may be another. It may whisper, or it may shout. We must concede\r\nthat the advertising the automobile promoters have done was more\r\nlargely of the shouting than the whispering kind. That is not to their\r\ndiscredit\xe2\x80\x94rather otherwise. The distinct injunction to advertise is\r\ncontained in the Bible. It was: \xe2\x80\x9cTo so let your good work shine that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\netc., and the people of scriptural days were admonished not to hide\r\ntheir light under a bushel.\r\n\r\nNewspapers are said, somewhat carelessly, to have made the automobile\r\nbusiness. It is not exactly fair to make this statement so sweepingly.\r\nThey did for it a good deal more than they did for any other line of\r\nindustry, and are still doing it.\r\n\r\nThey never devoted the space that they gave to the automobile to\r\nrailroads, steamboats, the telephone, street railways, oil, lumber,\r\nmining, meat packing, or any other commercial industry. It was not,\r\nnecessarily, that the automobile manufacturers, in all cases, asked for\r\nthis liberal treatment by the newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt was that newspapers volunteered it. One started it, and others\r\nfollowed. The spell which the idea contained in the automobile weaves\r\nover men and women was cast equally over the editors and publishers in\r\nthe United States. In recognition of the novelty of the automobile,\r\nthey laid liberal offerings of free space on the altar of motordom. Its\r\npeculiar exhilaration penetrated the editorial sanctum, and in this\r\ndistinctive exhilaration the automobile has had no parallel except in\r\ngolf.\r\n\r\nIt has been quite generally accepted as an axiom that if you give, you\r\nreceive. We see this statement proved in a hundred ways. A pleasant\r\nsmile begets a smile. A good deed is matched in kind. No better reason\r\nfor this exists, probably, than that it is ingrained in us to hate to\r\nbe under obligations to anybody. So when we get a smile we promptly pay\r\nit back and are square, just as we invite to lunch a man who invited us\r\nto lunch. We are very particular about this.\r\n\r\nThe automobile manufacturers were not lacking in this trait, common\r\nto human nature. When publishers put their stamp of approval on the\r\nmotor car and unreservedly threw open their columns to the progress\r\nmade in its improvements and production, manufacturers appreciated and\r\nreciprocated.\r\n\r\nThe result has been that more money has been spent in advertising in\r\nthe automobile business in the United States than has been spent in\r\nany other single line of enterprise. Possibly the nearest approach to\r\nit has been patent medicine, or the promotion of various enterprises.\r\n\r\nAnd it has paid\xe2\x80\x94every automobile maker, and every salesman will admit\r\nthis as a matter of course. They will admit it because they know it to\r\nbe so\xe2\x80\x94a knowledge derived in their own experience.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of advertising shows that there are two principal things\r\ninvolved in making advertising profitably productive. One is that it\r\ninforms, the other that it persuades. If the mind is informed of what\r\nan automobile is, what it does, and all the advantages and benefits it\r\nconfers, it has a basis to work on, and from this working basis it will\r\nevolve conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe state of the mind in the conclusive stage is fallow field for\r\npersuasive effort.\r\n\r\nIn the advertising given in this country to the automobile which has\r\nplaced millions of motor cars in the ownership of people in the United\r\nStates, not counting those exported, the publishers of our journals\r\nhave supplied the information, and the manufacturer the persuasion.\r\n\r\nIt is this double teamwork which, supplementing the business ability\r\nof our manufacturers, has put us in the front rank as automobile\r\nproducers. But baldly to say that the newspapers made the automobile\r\nis not giving full credit to the other causes which contribute to our\r\nsuccess in this line of enterprise. It has been a combination of causes\r\nworking together which has made the automobile.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES A FERTILE FIELD.\r\n\r\nThere have been other forms of advertising used in automobile selling,\r\nbesides space in publications, and they are forms the value of which\r\ncannot be discounted. \xe2\x80\x9cA satisfied customer is the best advertisement\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis one of the oldest slogans of advertising. And it is true. The\r\nautomobile manufacturers of the United States know it is true, and have\r\nbeen guided by it.\r\n\r\nRoad races, speed and endurance contests, employment of racing drivers\r\nwith records, automobile shows, outdoor displays\xe2\x80\x94all have been forms\r\nof advertising employed in the industry, and all have played their\r\npart and exerted their influence to one common end\xe2\x80\x94that of putting the\r\nindustry in the United States on the highest pinnacle it has attained\r\nanywhere in the world in seventeen years.\r\n\r\nAnd while full credit must be given the vision and capabilities of the\r\nmanufacturers, and the productive value of advertising in all forms,\r\nmeed for the results can not be withheld from that element, which, in\r\nthe final analysis, makes all things possible\xe2\x80\x94the people, the base and\r\ngroundwork on which all successful industrial structures are erected.\r\n\r\nAll the business ability of all the automobile makers, however great,\r\nand all the advertising, however convincing, that could be written,\r\ncould not have made the automobile business of today if the people had\r\nnot taken hold of the automobile and put their stamp of approval on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPower of the Press\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what is it but the \xe2\x80\x9cPower of the People\xe2\x80\x9d expressed\r\non paper? Power of the People\xe2\x80\x94the force that revolves the world,\r\nrevolved the wheels of millions of automobiles, and will go on turning\r\nthe wheels of millions more.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States supplied the fertile field in which the\r\nAmerican automobile grew and blossomed.\r\n\r\nThe reason France, although it took the lead in the commercialization\r\nof the motor car, could not hold it in the race with this country is to\r\nbe found in the difference between the peoples of the two countries.\r\n\r\nFrance had good roads\xe2\x80\x94has had them as has Europe for hundreds of years.\r\nThe French had money\xe2\x80\x94they are the greatest savers in the world.\r\n\r\nBut if you put your money in rentes or savings banks, you do not spend\r\nit for automobiles or anything else. The reason the French have money\r\nis the reason they do not buy automobiles.\r\n\r\nNo people in the world have learned, as have Americans, to spend money\r\nto make money. No people in the world take the chances Americans do,\r\nand no people win as the Americans do. In this is found one of many\r\ncauses for the commercial success of the automobile in America.\r\n\r\nThe American is good to himself as is the man of no other nationality.\r\nHe is further advanced in general knowledge, mostly gained by\r\nexperience through intercommunication with his fellows. His bon\r\ncamaraderie is effervescent, giving him opportunities to learn things\r\ndenied to the self-restrained European. His school is the broad school\r\nof the world. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to travel to see the world; the world is\r\nin America and comes to him.\r\n\r\nSo, with the opportunities natural to a new country, with the standards\r\nof living and the mode of thought that they are in the United States,\r\nthe 103,000,000 people of continental United States are a market for\r\nautomobiles that dwarf the 464,000,000 people of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhat such a market has been during the last decade and a half may be\r\ngathered from the fact that in the last sixteen years the population of\r\nthe United States increased at a greater rate than ever in its history.\r\nThe increase of the people of the United States in the sixteen years\r\nthe automobile industry has been commercialized, was 25,887,904. In the\r\nprevious twenty years the increase was 25,838,792.\r\n\r\nPeople without money can not buy automobiles, so what has been the\r\nincrease in wealth in the United States in this same period?\r\n\r\nIn the last twelve years it has been $99,221,764,315.\r\n\r\nStaggering, you say? Rather, when you know that the increase in wealth\r\nin the United States in the last twelve years was nearly double the\r\nincrease in the twenty years which preceded the last twelve years.\r\n\r\nNo epoch in the world\xe2\x80\x99s history, therefore, was so favorable as\r\nthe period of 1900-1917 for commercializing the automobile. It was\r\ntimed just to the moment for quick and dramatic success. The period\r\nwas coincident with the high water marks reached in the increase of\r\npopulation and in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s money-making. Advertising had reached a\r\nstage of development it had not attained before.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS IN THEIR COURSES FOUGHT FOR THE AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\nWe must credit enthusiasm for some of the influence in the success of\r\nthe industry. We will have to admit that it is present in the factory\r\nand in the selling mart, in the shows and on the road. A satisfied\r\ncustomer, the best advertisement, finds expression in the loyal\r\nrecommendation an owner gives his own make of car; enthusiasm of maker,\r\nof salesman, of owner\xe2\x80\x94it runs along the line, and if advertising is the\r\ngasoline which makes the car go, enthusiasm is the oil which keeps the\r\nbearings of the industry lubricated.\r\n\r\nThe year 1898 saw the first real attempts of manufacturers in the\r\nUnited States, either of gasoline, electric or steam cars, to make them\r\nin any quantity.\r\n\r\nThe gasoline cars that were pioneers were the Duryea, the Ford and the\r\nHaynes, but until 1898 these were distinctly still in the field of\r\nexperimentation. Ford personally built a car run by a gasoline motor of\r\nthe two-cylinder, four-cycle type of his own construction, and this car\r\nran 25 miles an hour. Ford was second only to Duryea who constructed\r\nthe first gasoline car built in the United States.\r\n\r\nDuryea persisted in producing a buggy type of car, and failed to\r\nget any sale for it. Ford and Haynes had no better luck in finding\r\npurchasers for their cars.\r\n\r\nAlexander Winton entered the field after Duryea, Ford and Haynes, and\r\nin 1898 sold the first gasoline car that was bought for use in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nFord built his first car in 1893. It was not a perfect car, but better\r\nthan any which had preceded it. He built his second car in 1895, with\r\na 4 \xc3\x97 4 two-cylinder, four-cycle motor. In this year he organized\r\nthe Detroit Automobile Company with a capital of $50,000. Ford owned\r\none-sixth interest, and drew $100 a month salary as chief engineer.\r\n\r\nIn the six years Ford remained with the Detroit Automobile Company it\r\nput out only two or three cars. In 1901 Ford severed his connection\r\nwith the company, which shortly became the Cadillac Automobile Company,\r\nand is now the Cadillac Motor Car Company. The Cadillac has had a\r\nsuccessful career, and is one of the cars of which a particularly large\r\nnumber has been sold.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Detroit Automobile Company, Ford started a machine shop\r\nof his own, and in 1902 produced a car with a 90-inch wheel base, and\r\nwhich is now regarded as standard gauge, using the two cylinders, 4 \xc3\x97\r\n4, and a double opposed engine.\r\n\r\nAfter much difficulty he got money from half a dozen persons and\r\norganized the Ford Motor Company with a capital of $100,000. At first\r\nhe owned only 25-1/2 per cent of the stock, but later he borrowed\r\n$175,000 and bought 25-1/2 per cent more, and still later by paying 700\r\nper cent of its face value, secured 7-1/2 per cent more, which makes\r\nhis holding in the company at this time 58-1/2 per cent of the stock.\r\n\r\nThe first Ford car to be a commercial success was put out in 1903, and\r\nthe record of production of Ford cars to date is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Year.     No. Cars.\r\n  1904        1,708\r\n  1905        1,695\r\n  1906        1,599\r\n  1907        8,423\r\n  1908        6,398\r\n  1909       10,607\r\n  1910       18,664\r\n  1911       34,528\r\n  1912       78,440\r\n  1913      168,220\r\n  1914      248,307\r\n  1915      308,213\r\n  1916      533,921\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the Ford production was over one-sixth of the 3,000,000 cars in\r\nuse in the United States. In that year he produced nearly one-third of\r\nall the passenger cars made in that year.\r\n\r\nFord\xe2\x80\x99s car was a small, low priced car from the start. Haynes\xe2\x80\x99 was a\r\nlarger and higher priced car. Winton\xe2\x80\x99s was likewise a large and more\r\nexpensive car.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RAIN OF AUTOMOBILE MAKERS.\r\n\r\nThe year of the Spanish-American war\xe2\x80\x941898\xe2\x80\x94saw the beginning of a\r\nveritable rain of automobile manufacturers in the United States. In\r\nthat year the Stanley, Stearns, Thomas, Matheson, Winton, and the\r\nWaverley Company entered the field.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, there appeared the Locomobile Company, Olds, Baker-Electric\r\nand Pierce-Racine (later absorbed by J. I. Case and now the Case car).\r\n\r\nIn 1900, Packard, Peerless, Glide, National Electric, Lambert, Elmore,\r\nBabcock, Jackson, Knox and Lane were entrants in the lists.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Acme, Gaeth, Pierce-Arrow, White, Royal Tourist,\r\nStevens-Duryea, Waltham-Orient, Pope-Toledo, Welch, Pullman and Rambler.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Cadillac, Franklin, Pope, Studebaker, Sultan, Okey, Walter and\r\nSchacht.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, Ford, Auburn, Overland, Moline, Premier, Corbin, Bergdall,\r\nHolsman, Columbus and Chadwick.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, Buick, Cleveland, American Napier, Stoddard-Dayton, Marmon,\r\nMitchell, Jewel, McIntyre, Pittsburgh Electric, Ranch &amp; Lang and\r\nSimplex.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Alco, American, Dorris, Johnson, Jonz, Kisselcar, Maxwell,\r\nMonarch, Reo, Studebaker, Garford and American Mors.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, Anderson, A. B. C., Cartercar, Brunn, Thomas-Detroit, Kearns,\r\nSterling, Mora, Moon, Pennsylvania, Palmer &amp; Singer and Staver.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Albany, Atlas, Brush, Bertolet, Byrider, Carter, Chalmers,\r\nCoppock, De Luxe, Oakland, Regal, Selden, Speedwell, Interstate, Lozier\r\nand Great Western.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Sharp-Arrow, Pittsburgh 6, Crown Midland, Rider-Lewis,\r\nPaige-Detroit, Velie, Cole, E. M. F. and Hupmobile.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Hudson, Advance, Cunningham, Coates-Goshen, Ohio and Abbott.\r\n\r\nSince 1909 to date new cars put on the market include:\r\n\r\nStutz (1911), Chevrolet (1912), Grand, Chandler, Saxon and\r\nScripps-Booth (1913), Dodge and Dort (1914), Owen Magnetic (1915),\r\nDrexel and Elgin (1916). Other automobiles in the field are the\r\nMaibohm, Allen, Ben-Hur, Crow-Elkhart, Harroun, Lexington and Madison.\r\n\r\nA table giving a complete list of automobiles is printed elsewhere in\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\nThe earlier manufacturers of motor cars included many who had been\r\nengaged in manufacturing bicycles, and following them was a group that\r\nhad successfully manufactured wagons and carriages. Still another set\r\nof manufacturers were machinery men.\r\n\r\nIn the list of names of automobile companies which have been organized\r\nduring the period of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s development, there are some which\r\nhave gone out of business, but not many.\r\n\r\nThe industry, generally speaking, has had comparatively few complete\r\nfailures. Mortality has been lower with it than with many other\r\nbusiness enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis is chiefly due to the intelligence which the manufacturers brought\r\nto the business, plus the demand which sprang up for the automobile\r\nas soon as the people, instructed with great and liberal space by the\r\npress, realized it was the vehicle that could give what they wanted.\r\nNever was the value of a concerted campaign of education better\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThat unusually intelligent study of the subject of suiting the popular\r\ndesire was given by manufacturers is evidenced in many ways, but in\r\nnone that is so typical as was the standardization of motor cars.\r\n\r\nAt one stage of the industry its very life was threatened by a lack of\r\nuniformity in the mechanical construction of the various types of the\r\nautomobile.\r\n\r\nThe big idea that has made Henry Ford\xe2\x80\x99s millions was a combination\r\none. It was the building of a motor and car combined which could be\r\nconstructed at a cost that would command large quantity production.\r\nThis conception by Ford, alone, simple though it was, proclaims him the\r\ngenius he undoubtedly is.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of cars between 1898, when sales first began to be made,\r\nand 1903, when Ford put out his car, was practically confined to\r\npeople of wealth and leisure. It required both to own and operate\r\nan automobile. Men bought them at a cost of $3,000 to $12,000 each.\r\nPurchasers were exhilarated by auto-intoxication\xe2\x80\x94with little thought of\r\nthe practical uses the invention could be put to. Snobbishness, social\r\nimpression and display of superior wealth were back of many purchases.\r\n\r\nBut for the manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 quick recognition that the future of the\r\nautomobile did not rest with the rich, that to be a great money-making\r\nindustry, they must make automobiles for the mass and not for the\r\nclass, the business would probably today be no further advanced than it\r\nwas fifteen years ago. A parallel of what might have been may be found\r\nin yachting or motor boating\xe2\x80\x94two methods of deriving pleasure and speed\r\nwhich are confined to the rich, largely because prohibitive in cost to\r\nthe mass.\r\n\r\nPopularization of the automobile demanded standardization.\r\nAutomobilization of the nation would never be accomplished if the\r\nhundreds of manufacturers that sprang up produced hundreds of\r\ndifferent cars with different sizes of parts, and different standards,\r\nrequiring owners of cars with which something had gone wrong, to wait\r\nindefinitely for a particular device used by a certain company.\r\n\r\nEarly owners of cars learned by bitter experience what it meant to have\r\na screw loose or a tire put out of business in a town where the supply\r\nstores did not sell that particular screw or that particular tire.\r\nThe spread of distance, annihilated by the auto, was threatened by\r\ndifficulties such as these.\r\n\r\nHigh maintenance and repair costs ate up many an automobile buyer in\r\nthe early days of the craze. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the original cost, although that\r\nwas high enough; it was the upkeep.\r\n\r\nMen of real ability\xe2\x80\x94competent business men and expert engineers\xe2\x80\x94got\r\ninto the business, fortunately, largely for the rewards it promised,\r\nand by standardization and systematization brought the cost production\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING THE PRICE OF AUTOMOBILES DOWN.\r\n\r\nThe engineers banded together and studied standards of hard steel,\r\nscrew threads and wheel rims. The manufacturers, preserving open\r\nminds, co-operated, and today automobiles are the most interchangeable\r\nof all assembled mechanisms.\r\n\r\nBut for this the farmer, the moderate salaried city man, the mechanic\r\nand the small tradesman would not today be consumers of motor cars.\r\nBut for this the average price for passenger cars, originally in 1900\r\naround $3,000 and by 1911 reduced to $1,000, would never have been\r\ngotten down in 1916 to $605.\r\n\r\nThe average price of all motor vehicles, combining pleasure cars and\r\ntrucks, was, in 1916, $636. The preponderance of passenger cars at the\r\nlower prices brought the average down, since the average price of motor\r\ntrucks alone was about $1,800. For every motor truck sold, eighteen\r\npassenger cars were disposed of in 1916.\r\n\r\nWith standardization and the consequent lowering of cost, the\r\nautomobile industry acquired a momentum that has carried production\r\nforward on a constantly ascending scale, as witness these figures of\r\npassenger cars alone:\r\n\r\n  Year        No. of\r\n             cars made\r\n  1909         80,000\r\n  1910        185,000\r\n  1911        200,000\r\n  1912        250,000\r\n  1915        842,249\r\n  1916      1,617,708\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of motor trucks almost doubled in one year. The number\r\nproduced in 1915 was 50,366. In 1916 the number made was 92,130.\r\n\r\nThe above table, showing the rate of increase in passenger cars made in\r\nseven years, makes it clear that the greatest growth in the passenger\r\ncar business has been since and including the year 1911.\r\n\r\nThat was the year in which the largest number of medium and low priced\r\nstandardized cars with refinement of detail and added equipments,\r\nselling from $1,500 down to $500, was first put on the market. Ford\r\nalmost doubled his output in that year. The next years, 1912 and 1913,\r\nalso he more than doubled each year his output of the previous year.\r\nAnd in 1916 he made nearly one-third of all the passenger cars produced\r\nin the entire United States in that year.\r\n\r\nCould anything demonstrate more conclusively than these facts, that\r\nif you have an article within the price of the mass of the people, it\r\nwill sell, if the people want it? The one idea of Henry Ford\xe2\x80\x94quantity\r\nsales\xe2\x80\x94saved to the United States the premiership in automobile making.\r\nFor other manufacturers adopted it, some radically, others in a\r\nmodified form. Its influence was unquestioned in putting the price of\r\nmotor cars at a figure at which a person happening to have less than\r\nthe income of a millionaire could afford to buy one, so that when every\r\none of the many values and benefits of the existence of the modern\r\nautomobile is scheduled, let us, in giving credit for them, place the\r\nname of Ford at the head of the list.\r\n\r\nWhen we have arrived at our destination, or have attained an object\r\nmuch desired, our satisfaction is such that we are in a forgiving mind\r\nand prone to forget the sacrifices we had to make, the difficulties we\r\nhad to overcome, the strenuous work we had to do. The end justified the\r\nmeans, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t think long about the hardships in the means.\r\n\r\nPre\xc3\xabminence of the United States in the motor field has not been gained\r\nwithout hardships, sacrifices and disappointments by those engaged in\r\nit, nor was it reached by the immediate and uninterrupted success of\r\nall companies organized to commercialize the invention.\r\n\r\nWhile, as we have stated before, the number of final failures of\r\ncompanies was small compared with those in some other avenues of\r\nenterprise in the development stage, the number of individuals and\r\ncorporations in the automobile business that started on the wrong\r\nroad and found it impassable, was not small. But here again it was\r\nfortunate for humanity, reckoning the automobile as one of the greatest\r\nboons vouchsafed the human race, that the mechanical perfection of\r\nthe automobile was reached at a date coincident with more enlightened\r\nthought, a liberalism of view and a clearer vision of the possibilities\r\nof the future by our men of business.\r\n\r\nFor automobile enterprises that took the wrong road and got mired\r\nin the mud of mechanical and management difficulties and financial\r\ncomplications were, most of them, lifted out of the slough by men\r\nwho knew the right road and were better drivers. Had the automobile\r\ndeveloped mechanically to near-perfection a score of years before it\r\ndid, not only would the people as a mass not have been ready for it,\r\nbut it is doubtful if business at that period had developed to the\r\npoint of efficiency where it could recognize the possibilities latent\r\nin the motor car as a money-making machine. Where money is, the best\r\nbrains go. Capital is timid. But brains and capital want only to be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nSome of the most successful motor cars and motor car companies of today\r\nwere deeply mired in financial difficulties a decade ago, but were\r\npried and towed out and made great successes by new brains and new\r\ncapital administered by a new set of men.\r\n\r\nNor was the industry immune from the bane of all invention\r\nindustries\xe2\x80\x94the patent right. The man who gave it the most trouble was\r\nthe man whose name is far up toward the head of the list of men who\r\nwere responsible for the inventive ideas involved in the motive feature\r\nof the automobile\xe2\x80\x94Selden.\r\n\r\nHe kept the industry in a ferment for ten years or more, whether\r\ndesignedly or not, through his patent, the mere existence of which\r\ntended toward restraining its development by discouraging inventive\r\nexpansion, and ceasing to exercise the depressing effects of a wet\r\nblanket on automobile growth only when the influence of his patent was\r\nneutralized by an adverse court decision.\r\n\r\nThe earlier commercialism of the automobile was characterized by many\r\nextravagances in expansive plans, high financing and even recklessness,\r\nnot only on the part of manufacturers, but buyers of automobiles as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIn getting the price down to a figure which is not excessive,\r\nthe manufacturers removed the cause which militated most against\r\npopularization of the invention and provided one of the reasons for\r\nopposition to it by many people. To pay the prices which originally\r\nprevailed, men mortgaged their homes and women sold their diamonds\r\nand went bankrupt on the upkeep of the car. Manufacturers expanded\r\ntoo lavishly, overcapitalized, and attempted great stockjobbing\r\nconsolidations, while incompetent officers were paid excessive\r\nsalaries, until conservative financiers entered a protest and the banks\r\ncalled a halt.\r\n\r\nThe abuses which were co-existent with one of the eras of the\r\nautomobile\xe2\x80\x99s development caused the industry to be regarded by a class\r\nof the people as a luxurious outlaw and a menace to the well-being of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nVice-President Fairbanks raised his voice to protest against the new\r\nmanifestation of human nature\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for joy and comfort.\r\n\r\nJames A. Patten declared a Kansas City bank held fifty-two mortgages\r\non as many automobiles, and that that sort of loaning was going to be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nCertain banks blocked, as far as possible, loans for purchases of\r\nautomobiles. A prominent banker as late as 1910 declared that the\r\ninitial cost of automobiles to American users, being $250,000,000\r\na year, with as much more for upkeep and incidental expense, was\r\nequivalent in actual economic waste each year to twice the value of\r\nproperty destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake.\r\n\r\nA year after this statement was made, 1911, saw the dawn of the epoch\r\nof low priced cars, and the low priced car has reversed the condition\r\nfrom an economic waste, if such it was, to an economic gain, which it\r\nundoubtedly is.\r\n\r\nThrough all the storms of protest and criticisms, manufacturers went\r\non their way, just as the automobile inventors had done under similar\r\ncircumstances when men laughed and scoffed at them and called them\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\nThe depression of 1893 came too early to affect the automobile\r\nindustry, but that of 1907 hit it at the time when it was by no means\r\nas strong as it was later; and yet, while in that year dozens of\r\ncompanies were bankrupted, and in 1910, fifty-two went out of business,\r\nit should be said that the great majority of them were not actually\r\nstarters in the race. They were entrants that never toed the scratch.\r\nTheir failure to make a start was due to lack of capital or inefficient\r\norganizers. A very large proportion of automobile companies that\r\nactually started in business have survived and are successful.\r\n\r\nNames of automobile manufacturers who are prominent today were familiar\r\nnames in the earlier stages of the industry, and more of the original\r\nautomobile makers have survived than have fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVING OBSTACLES TO AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nOne objection the old philosopher has to the automobile is an objection\r\nthat is strengthened by the fact that he does not own one. It is that\r\nthe automobile contributes toward making the age one in which a really\r\nshort time appears to be and is generally regarded as a long time. It\r\ndestroys proportions as it annihilates space.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years is a shorter time in the view of the philosopher of\r\n60, accustomed to reviewing events in his past life half a century\r\nback, than it appears to a man of 34. It is just half the length of\r\nthis young man\xe2\x80\x99s years. Time, as to duration, is thus comparative to\r\ndifferent views.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years is not long for a commercial industry to take the place\r\nwhich the automobile business now occupies in a country as great as\r\nthis. It is a short time in which to build up a business representing\r\nthe figures of two billion on the mark of the American dollar.\r\n\r\nBut this business, which has not been a business for even a score of\r\nyears, did not arrive at its present estate without vicissitudes, and\r\nwithout strenuous work in removing obstacles in the way of its progress.\r\n\r\nThe seventeen years in which the industry made its record, saw the rise\r\nand the fall of the steamer type of car, the wresting of an Old Man of\r\nthe Sea, in the form of a discouraging patent holder from the shoulders\r\nof the manufacturers, the electric car largely depopularized and the\r\ngasoline car established in wellnigh universal favor.\r\n\r\nThe procession of the more important earlier pioneers in the\r\ncommercialization of the automobile started with the Pope Manufacturing\r\nCompany at its head. In 1897 this company, which had successfully made\r\nbicycles, manufactured electric cars at Hartford, but was unable to\r\nfind a market for them in the United States. An effort was made to get\r\nthe Newport set to take them up, but the wealthy owners of Newport\r\nvillas could not be induced to be even mildly interested.\r\n\r\nSo the Pope company decided to send them abroad, and shipped them on\r\nthe steamer La Bourgogne. But this ship sank at sea and the cars were\r\nlost. The Pope company then made electric cabs, many of which appeared\r\non the streets of New York in 1898 and 1899, and finally sold its\r\nelectric vehicle business to the Columbia Automobile Company of New\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\nThis corporation was formed by a party of capitalists headed by\r\nWilliam C. Whitney of New York, and included P. A. B. Widener of\r\nPhiladelphia, A. F. Brady of Albany, and Thomas F. Ryan of New York.\r\nAll were interested and actively engaged in street electric traction\r\ndevelopment in the East. Whitney, who was in public life as Secretary\r\nof the Navy under Cleveland, was a man of far vision in industrial\r\npossibilities, and recognized early in its development stage that\r\nthe automobile had a future. He was as quick to see, also, that the\r\ngasoline motor drive was the coming means of propulsion, and he caused\r\nthe Columbia Automobile Company, whose name was changed to the Electric\r\nVehicle Company, to negotiate for and finally secure complete rights to\r\nthe Selden patents for gasoline motors.\r\n\r\nHaving a sweeping license agreement with Selden, the Electric Vehicle\r\nCompany undertook to enforce its rights, and one of the first concerns\r\nsued for infringement was the Winton Company, whose gasoline car, sold\r\nin 1898, was the first gasoline car disposed of by a manufacturer in\r\nthis country. The United States court upheld the patent, and nine\r\nof the then leading automobile manufacturers, finding they must pay\r\nroyalties, formed an association under the title of the Association of\r\nLicensed Automobile Manufacturers.\r\n\r\nFor thirteen years thereafter, until 1911, gasoline automobile\r\nmanufacture in the United States was under tribute to a royalty of\r\nfrom four-fifths of one per cent to 1-1/4 per cent of the retail\r\nprice of all cars sold. The beneficiary of this license fee was the\r\nElectric Vehicle Company, which \xe2\x80\x9csplit\xe2\x80\x9d the fees with Selden, and the\r\nAssociation of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers itself. The fees\r\namounted to very large sums, and the licensees wriggled and squirmed;\r\nbut the United States District Court having upheld the Selden patent,\r\nthere was no way out, unless a deliverer appeared.\r\n\r\nAnd such a deliverer did appear.\r\n\r\nIt was none other than Henry Ford.\r\n\r\nFor a pacifist, Henry Ford is about the greatest fighter the American\r\nindustrial ranks have ever produced. His history has been a succession\r\nof fights\xe2\x80\x94fights to make a motor that would go inside a hat box, fights\r\nto get anybody to believe in him and invest money with him, fights\r\nto convince people that nearly everybody would buy an automobile if\r\nthe price was low enough, and finally the fiercest and most prolonged\r\nfight of all\xe2\x80\x94the fight to break the Selden patent monopoly and free the\r\nindustry from serfdom, give it free rein and relieve it of the incubus\r\nof tribute.\r\n\r\nFord had refused to join the Association of Licensed Automobile\r\nManufacturers and had gone on making his engine and adapting it to a\r\ncar which he put out, as has before been said, in 1903. The Electric\r\nVehicle Company, which held the reins and was driving all the gasoline\r\ncar makers except Ford, cracked its whip in Henry\xe2\x80\x99s direction and\r\nbrought him up standing, and bristling as well.\r\n\r\nIn the suit for infringement against Ford the Electric Vehicle Company\r\nwon in the lower United States court, but it reckoned without its\r\nFord. That product of a strain of Irish-English fighting blood didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconsider he was whipped because one court decided against him, as all\r\nthe other manufacturers, who submitted their necks meekly to the Selden\r\npatent yoke, had done.\r\n\r\nHe promptly appealed and fought the case like a wildcat up to the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals, and through that tribunal, and\r\nwith such success that, in 1911 this court reversed the finding of the\r\nlower court and gave the decision to Henry Ford.\r\n\r\nThe original suit in the lower court was begun against Ford in 1903,\r\nso that his fight against the first and only automobile \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d was an\r\neight year war.\r\n\r\nBut during it all, he never faltered in his activities in perfecting\r\nhis car and making his elaborate preparations to build and market it.\r\nHis confidence in his final victory was not affected in the slightest\r\ndegree. He went on, pursuing his object with unruffled mien.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a trying brand of chagrin that the gasoline car\r\nmanufacturers, who had tamely submitted to their first setback in\r\nthe effort to slip the fetters of patent rights, had to wear around\r\nwith them. They had looked askance at Ford. They feared he was likely\r\nto kill the automobile \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d by putting out a car that would make\r\nautomobiling common, and put a damper on the purchase of the cars\r\nthey made, by people who could afford to buy them. At best, he was\r\ncalculated to be a disturbing element in the business\xe2\x80\x94probably driving\r\ndown prices to a point where there would be no profit in them.\r\n\r\nAnd here he had been the savior of the automobile business.\r\n\r\nMany men have written letters that have been their undoing. Selden had\r\nmade an entry in a personal notebook or diary that brought about his\r\ndownfall and the loosening of his grip on automobile manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which the United States Circuit Court of Appeals decided\r\nfor Ford and against the Selden patent was that the intent of the\r\ninventor had been to patent a motor designed after the type of a motor\r\ninvented by Brayton of which the Ford motor was not an infringement,\r\nand not after the type of the gas engine of Otto the German, of which\r\nthe Ford motor would have been an infringement, and that Selden had\r\nclearly disclosed this intent, as evidenced by a slurring entry in\r\nhis diary regarding the four-cycle Otto engine, characterizing it as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9canother of those d\xe2\x80\x94d Dutch engines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Otto engine for stationary purposes was in use before Selden filed\r\nhis application for the patent, and if he did not intend the patent to\r\ncover an engine of that type he had no hold on the manufacturers who,\r\nwith scarcely a single exception, were making automobiles, with motors\r\npatterned after the Otto type. These manufacturers could have done what\r\nFord did\xe2\x80\x94taken the case up and got the same decision, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it, thereby making Henry Ford the emancipator of the automobile\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThis delivery by Ford of automobile manufacturing from patent restraint\r\nand his quantity production idea, without any other of the many things\r\nhe has done, would have made Henry Ford what he is\xe2\x80\x94the most commanding\r\nfigure in the automobile industry today.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the very existence of the Selden patent with\r\nthe rights it conferred to tax every single automobile, was a deterrent\r\nto the growth of the business, because with the wiping out, through\r\nFord\xe2\x80\x99s court victory, of the right of William C. Whitney\xe2\x80\x99s Electric\r\nVehicle Company to take toll of all gasoline autocars produced,\r\nencouragement was given to capital to invest more largely in the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIf, in the springtime, the season when the grass begins to sprout, you\r\nremove an old door that has lain flat on the grass all winter, the\r\ngrass in the space covered by that door will literally spring up.\r\n\r\nSo when the lid\xe2\x80\x94the Selden patent\xe2\x80\x94was lifted from the automobile\r\nindustry, it sprang to the front. The year 1911 was the epochal year\r\nin volume of production in the business. From that year dates the\r\npresent era of automobile high production. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that many new\r\ncompanies entered the field. It was that those already in it expanded\r\nand increased their output. There was no longer an Old Man of the\r\nSea, in the form of a tax on production, clinging to their necks and\r\nshoulders. The age of standardization had come, and the soundness of\r\nFord\xe2\x80\x99s quantity production idea had been demonstrated. Thence on,\r\nthe automobile industry had a clear course, if not in all cases easy\r\nsailing, and it has traversed it on a straight line, with a current of\r\npopular demand running strong in the direction it has been headed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASOLINE CAR IN POPULAR DEMAND.\r\n\r\nPioneers in manufacturing gasoline cars during the period beginning\r\nat the time\xe2\x80\x941898\xe2\x80\x94when the first gasoline car, a Winton, was sold,\r\nwere Clarke Bros., makers of the Auto-car, E. R. Thomas whose name\r\nthe Thomas Flier took, Stearns, Chalmers, Jeffery, Wilkinson, who\r\ndesigned the Franklin car, Olds who changed from steam to gasoline,\r\nBrush, Ford, Leland who produced the Cadillac, Haynes and Apperson.\r\nMany familiar cars came into the field later, or were developed and\r\nadvertised by men who became identified with them at a later date.\r\nAlthough its manufacture was started in 1903, the Overland car, which\r\nranks second to Ford in quantity production, did not become the factor\r\nin the industry it is today until John North Willys, a salesman,\r\nbecame identified with it and gave it its remarkable vogue through his\r\npersonality and spectacular salesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe gasoline car was struggling to perfection when the electric and\r\nsteam types of cars were reasonably well established on the market.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, New England saw its first motor race of electric cars. The\r\nnames of make or makers of electric cars familiar from that date\r\non include those of Riker, Pope, Waverley, Baker, Woods, Barrows,\r\nStudebaker, whose first cars were electric, Columbus Buggy, Rauch &amp;\r\nLang, Detroit, Ohio and Anderson.\r\n\r\nBut the electric car industry never has reached the proportions of the\r\ngasoline car industry. It has never advertised in the lavish manner\r\nadopted by gasoline car makers. It has not entered races to the extent\r\nits gasoline competitors have. It adopted conservative methods which\r\nhave given it a slow growth. It is only within the last five years that\r\nshaft drives have been perfected in electric car construction, while\r\nproducing controllers that would not arc, whatever the provocation,\r\nhave been matters of slow evolution.\r\n\r\nBut that the electric car is a perfectly balanced piece of mechanism\r\nand the one type of the automobile with the least fits and starts, is\r\nconceded, and this superiority will doubtless enable the electric type\r\nto make up in the future in the motor truck field what it has lost to\r\nthe gasoline type in the passenger field.\r\n\r\nIf the passenger automobile has not reached the length of its use and\r\nconsumption, and it unquestionably has not, what shall be said of the\r\nfreight automobile, the industry in which is yet in embryo?\r\n\r\nThe greatest future field for the automobile is without doubt in this\r\ndirection, as is evidenced by numberless indications.\r\n\r\nThe increase in motor trucks made in 1916 over 1915 was within less\r\nthan 8,000 of being double the number of the previous year. The number\r\nproduced in 1916 was 92,130, against 50,369 in 1915, with an increase\r\nin retail value of $40,000,000. A business that nearly doubles in\r\nproduct while showing an increase in total sales of only 33-1/3 per\r\ncent, as the automobile truck business does, is seen by analysis to be\r\ngetting the price of its units down, and that is the surest means in\r\ncommercial production to insure increased consumption.\r\n\r\nPerfected devices are operating in the motor truck field as they did in\r\nthe passenger car field to lower cost, and the lower the cost of motor\r\ntrucks is gotten down, the more people will buy them.\r\n\r\nThe field of the motor truck\xe2\x80\x99s usefulness is ever widening. The\r\nEuropean war has demonstrated many directions in which it can be\r\nutilized, while its adaptation to the country is as feasible and\r\neconomical as its adoption by the city. Its use by national, state and\r\ncity governmental departments is growing rapidly, and the best evidence\r\nexists of its superior economy to the horse for many purposes. And when\r\nthe high wave of motor truck use rolls in, the electric type will be\r\nfound riding on its crest. Already there are upwards of 50,000 electric\r\ntrucks alone in use.\r\n\r\nThe electric passenger car, while far behind the gasoline car in the\r\nrace of automobiles, is distinctly in the lead of the steam type.\r\nNever was the biblical saying, \xe2\x80\x9cand the first shall be last,\xe2\x80\x9d truer\r\nthan of the steam automobile. First to arrive at the starting line,\r\nit was distanced early in the quarter stretch. The first steam car in\r\nthe United States was sold in 1889, the first electric in 1892 and the\r\nfirst gasoline in 1898. And though it had a start over the gasoline car\r\nof nine years, it was never able seriously to compete with it, and 1905\r\nsaw only one large manufacturer left in the steam car industry.\r\n\r\nAt one time, about 1900, it looked as though steam and gasoline cars\r\nwere running neck and neck in popular favor, and the names of Riker,\r\nWhite, C. E. Whitney and Stanley were as well known almost as those of\r\nFord, Chalmers and a score of gasoline car makers are known today, but\r\nthe contest was a short one.\r\n\r\nThe gasoline car forged ahead. Its success discouraged the steam\r\ncar makers, most of whom changed from steam car to gasoline car\r\nmanufacturing, and the business of steam car making narrowed down to\r\ntwo manufacturers\xe2\x80\x94Stanley and White. Finally, in 1911, White gave up\r\nmaking steam cars and devoted his facilities to gasoline cars only,\r\nleaving Stanley to share only with Doble in the steam field.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the car buying public gave enthusiastic patronage to\r\ngasoline cars and scant encouragement to steam cars was that the use\r\nof the steam car requires more mechanical knowledge than does that of\r\nthe gasoline car, and the work of making repairs is more complicated.\r\nThe man of today wants to do a thing in the easiest way. His education,\r\nthrough the conveniences supplied in modern life, is all along the line\r\nof short cuts to anywhere and anything. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy work when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nto,\xe2\x80\x9d is his motto, and he has never been able to see why he should take\r\nthe time to become a proficient mechanic to give himself pleasure, when\r\nhe can buy a gasoline car and escape doing so\xe2\x80\x94and much work in running\r\nhis car and repairing it, as well.\r\n\r\nThe steam automobile reached the zenith of its vogue prior to 1905.\r\nBeginning with that year, its use declined and that of gasoline cars\r\nincreased. The gasoline type is now almost universal in passenger\r\nautomobiles, and the fact that the power units in the operation of the\r\ngasoline motor are more economical than either electricity or steam,\r\nhas its bearing on their general popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOMOBILE DEMAND MADE ACCESSORIES NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nA history of the commercializing of the automobile which does not make\r\nmention of the manner in which the development of the industry called\r\ninto being an almost endless list of incidental and accessory products,\r\nis not complete.\r\n\r\nThe production of the finished automobile involves a multiplicity\r\nof units, and as no automobile manufacturer makes all of these, but\r\ndepends on independent factories for certain of them, there has been\r\na multiplication of enterprises supplying products entering in the\r\nconstruction of automobiles, whose development and financial success\r\nhave kept pace with those of the automobile itself.\r\n\r\nForemost in the list of accessories for the automobile are tires, and\r\nthe industry in this product is of vast proportions. The production of\r\nautomobiles\xe2\x80\x94passenger and freight\xe2\x80\x94having been 1,617,708 in 1916, and\r\nthe manufacturers having delivered each of these vehicles complete with\r\na set of four tires, the number of tires required for 1916 sales of\r\nautomobiles alone was 6,470,832.\r\n\r\nBut the tires put out with new automobiles form only a slight\r\nproportion of the total tires sold by tire companies. It is stated\r\nthat each of the over three million cars in use in the United States\r\nconsumes an average of eight tires a year, so that automobile buyers\r\nare purchasers of probably 20,000,000 tires a year.\r\n\r\nThe pneumatic tire was one of the greatest factors in giving the\r\nautomobile business its impetus. Charles Goodyear, in a broad sense,\r\nlaid the foundation for popularizing the automobile, when, by\r\naccidentally dropping rubber on a stove, he discovered the principle of\r\nvulcanization.\r\n\r\nThe development of the automobile was retarded for years, because,\r\nwhile iron shod horses, it would not successfully shoe automobile\r\nwheels. The greatest obstacle to the mechanical perfection, as well as\r\nto the development of the automobile by general adoption, were road\r\nshock to the automobile and mutilation by the automobile of the roads.\r\n\r\nThe pneumatic tire removed both obstacles simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe pneumatic tire was invented by an Englishman named Thompson, who\r\npatented it in 1845. Dunlop, an Irishman, was the pioneer manufacturer\r\nin 1888, and Michelin of France first applied it to the automobile.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of body parts is obviously a tremendous industry, and\r\nwhile the body is a prime essential to the automobile, it was a part\r\nthat existed in horse drawn vehicles, and, therefore, did not play the\r\npart that the pneumatic tire did in accelerating auto development.\r\n\r\nComparable in importance to the tire was the nonskid chain, the\r\ninvention of Parsons, an English engineer, who patented it in 1903. As\r\nthe pneumatic tire enabled the automobile to be used more successfully\r\nand in larger numbers in good weather, so the nonskid chain enabled\r\nit to be used in bad weather. Prior to its adoption automobiles were\r\nused to only a limited extent in wet or slippery weather. Its adoption\r\nis credited with having added one month a year to the possible use of\r\nevery automobile, a result which would naturally increase the number of\r\nautomobiles used, through making them more efficient, and by decreasing\r\nthe life of a car through added use.\r\n\r\nNext in importance in extending the field of purchasers of automobiles\r\nwas the self-starter, the invention of Coleman, who, though little\r\nknown to the public, is the inventor of so many things in electrical\r\nuse as to be comparable to Edison.\r\n\r\nThe electric self-starter is credited with creating a million\r\nautomobile buyers, a large proportion of whom are women, and with\r\nhaving added nearly 15 per cent to the service of the motor car.\r\n\r\nOther aids to the successful commercialization of the automobile are\r\nsolid tires, invented by Grant in 1896; the demountable rim, invented\r\nby Perlman in 1906; sliding transmission, the invention of Dyer; the\r\nnonskid tread, and chambered spark plugs, the latter invented by\r\nCanfield in 1898. Of minor improvements, of which there have been\r\nscores, the most notable were those of side doors, introduced by Marmon\r\nin 1902; tops to bodies, introduced in 1903; speedometer, gasoline\r\npressure system, carburetor, shock absorber, electric lighting and oil\r\ngauge.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the automobile has been facilitated by every\r\nimprovement which makes it easier of operation, and the sale of motor\r\ncars has been increased by them.\r\n\r\nThe more one reviews the advance made by the automobile during the\r\nseventeen years of its commercialization, the more one can appreciate\r\nthe feverishness characterizing its production, which can be seen and\r\nfelt by anyone who visits the automobile manufacturing sections of\r\nDetroit, Cleveland, Indianapolis or Toledo. The demand is so great\r\nfor automobiles, and they are being bought in such numbers, that the\r\nfactories producing them work at a speed and under a pressure such as\r\nare paralleled in our industrialism only in munitions of war plants.\r\nBusy are the cities where automobile manufacturing forms an important\r\nindustry, and busy they are likely to continue for years to come, for\r\nas a commercial industry the business of making and selling automobiles\r\nhas not yet even approached high water mark, in the opinion of those\r\nbest qualified to judge.\r\n\r\nThe country districts have yet to be heard from in louder tones. The\r\npossibilities of the automobile in the country, from a commercial\r\nstandpoint, constitute a fascinating subject for speculation. Although\r\nthere are over 6,000,000 farm families, only 300,000 automobiles were\r\nbought by them in 1916, indicating that the rural element so far has\r\nnot really begun to take hold of the automobile, because the normal\r\nyearly sales of horse drawn vehicles, most of which were sold in the\r\ncountry, prior to the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s adoption, were over 1,000,000.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest proportion of motor driven vehicles bought in the\r\ncountry are now passenger vehicles. When the farmer wakes up to the\r\neconomic superiority of the motor truck and motor tractor over the\r\nhorse, the sales of other forms than passenger cars in the country will\r\nscarcely have any bounds. The best grounds for this belief lie in the\r\nfact that at present there are 5,000,000 horse drawn vehicles in use,\r\nagainst less than 300,000 motor trucks.\r\n\r\nIn this development of the motor freight vehicle in the rural\r\ndistricts, the matter of education will play its part, as it does in\r\nall evolution, but slowly, as it always does.\r\n\r\nJust as the creation of farm products as a whole is being increased by\r\neducational means, so will the use of the motor wagon in place of the\r\nhorse be increased by the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 information and knowledge of its\r\nadvantages and saving.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmers all learn and realize the full extent to which\r\nthe use of the work automobile pays dividends on their labor, the\r\ncommercializing of this vehicle will be in quantities probably\r\nexceeding those of the passenger car.\r\n\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION\xe2\x80\x99S PART IN THE AUTOMOBILE\xe2\x80\x99S COMMERCIALIZATION.\r\n\r\nIf there is any one idea more than another that is productive of\r\nresults in development of large proportions, it would seem to be that\r\nrepresented by co-operation.\r\n\r\nIndividuals may make successes, but they are successes that are limited\r\nin their proportions.\r\n\r\nThe era of greatest material development in this country has been that\r\nin the period represented by the last quarter century. This is shown in\r\nthe fact that our national wealth during that period has increased in a\r\nratio unparalleled in any previous period of time.\r\n\r\nOnly a little reflection will show that same period to be that period\r\nin which the value and benefits of co-operation in business as a whole\r\nwere realized and taken advantage of.\r\n\r\nThe principle of co-operation has been known since man learned to\r\nreason. It was applied in the building of the tower of Babel and\r\nof the Pyramids. The foundation of it was a fact that man early in\r\nhis evolution from the cave stage discovered\xe2\x80\x94a simple fact plainly\r\ndemonstrated, when primitive human beings found that one man could\r\nnot lift a battering-ram, but that twenty men could make of it an\r\ninstrument with terrifying powers of destruction.\r\n\r\nAn aspect of co-operation that was slow in imposing itself on the\r\nunderstanding of the business world was that if a man conceived a\r\nnew idea, and he concealed it from others, he was not only depriving\r\nothers of its benefits, but himself as well. In locking the door on his\r\nidea, he locked himself in. He did not reflect that the world rests\r\non a foundation of co-operation; that nature is co-operative; that\r\nwithout co-ordination between the planets in space, the cosmic void\r\nwould not continue to be occupied; that co-operation is the invisible\r\nchain linking together the world, sun, moon and stars, and without the\r\nbinding twine of co-operation they would fall apart like the stalks\r\nfrom the sheaf when unbound.\r\n\r\nAlmost every valuable lesson might be learned from nature if we knew\r\nand fully understood her laws, and co-operation is one of the most\r\npotent of these laws. But it took man a long time to learn even the\r\nrudiments of this law of co-operation\xe2\x80\x94that it supplied a force of a\r\nhundred horsepower where one horsepower was used before; that its moral\r\ninfluence was tremendous, and that it was to business what the steam\r\nradiator, internal combustion, or the electric storage battery was\r\nto the horseless carriage\xe2\x80\x94a means of propulsion, a driving force, an\r\nagency of high power to produce progression.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the automobile industry had, in the era\r\nin which fate decreed it should make its debut, favorable conditions.\r\nNot only did this era happen to be the era of a better understanding\r\nof the science and value of advertising, but also the era in which a\r\nbetter understanding has been gained of the principle and value of\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nStandardization in the automobile industry, as has been said herein,\r\nwas an important factor in popularizing the motor car. But how could\r\nstandardization have been brought about without co-operation?\r\n\r\nProducers of automobiles, even, did not immediately adopt the real\r\nspirit and practice the true principle of co-operation. They formed\r\nan association with that purpose, but in the first meetings they\r\napproached the matter of genuine co-operation like a man walking in his\r\nbare feet on ground strewn with broken glass.\r\n\r\nThey kept up the practice of secretiveness; each man was afraid to \xe2\x80\x9cput\r\nthe other man wise,\xe2\x80\x9d still clinging to the ancient practice of hiding\r\nhis light under a bushel\xe2\x80\x94an impulse founded on that same semi-savage\r\nselfishness of primitive man which impelled him to hug to his hairy\r\nbreast the shin bone of his \xe2\x80\x9ckill,\xe2\x80\x9d while eyeing his fellow man with\r\nfear, hatred and distrust.\r\n\r\nGradually, through the influence of minds more original, independent\r\nand far seeing, the glacial reserve was thawed out, and automobile\r\nproducers began practicing co-operation in its unrestricted,\r\nuntrammelled form.\r\n\r\nWith the genial, warming rays of co-operation turned on the industry,\r\nproblems of vast quantity production at remarkably low cost, easy and\r\nrapid assembling, inexpensive maintenance, and the vexatious problems\r\nof freight movements to bring in raw material and take out the finished\r\nproduct for distribution, became no longer work, but fascinating\r\nplay. Thus does co-operation make an elysium of the workshop, turn\r\nthe darkness of gloom into the light of day, and give grounds for the\r\nbelief that if the millennium ever comes, co-operation will be the\r\nvehicle it will be transported in.\r\n\r\nAt one stage of the American automobile industry, the European cars\r\ndisplayed a strength and sturdiness so superior to ours that our\r\nmanufacturers nearly despaired. This was another crisis of many in\r\nthe industry. But co-operation enabled the cause to be found and the\r\ncrisis to be met. The European manufacturers knew why their cars stood\r\nup better than ours, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell. This was the same old\r\ndog-in-the-manger that has helped to make the world\xe2\x80\x99s progress slow.\r\nSo our manufacturers, co-operating, went to work and found out for\r\nthemselves. Tungsten, vanadium and chromium spelled the reason. The\r\nEuropeans had been using these and other alloys, and with scientific\r\nheat treatment had been producing a special steel, and keeping it\r\nstrictly to themselves.\r\n\r\nTrust the peeking, inquisitorial, persistent \xe2\x80\x9cYankee\xe2\x80\x9d to find out when\r\nhe once gets well started on the scent. And when there are a lot of\r\nthem, all peering and peeking about, what chance has the poor European?\r\nBut it is to be doubted if one \xe2\x80\x9cYankee\xe2\x80\x9d could have \xe2\x80\x9ctumbled\xe2\x80\x9d to chrome\r\nsteel. It took a combination of them to do it. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t discover the\r\nsecret until they were banded together by co-operation.\r\n\r\nCo-operation contributed to the general adoption by the motor industry\r\nof the automatic machining of parts. What that meant in economic\r\nproduction was the saving of millions in cost of construction, which in\r\nturn got the automobile down to the level of the common people\xe2\x80\x99s price.\r\n\r\nIn the adoption of the system which substituted the \xe2\x80\x9cmachining\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nautomobile parts for hand production, the industry instituted savings\r\nof time and labor and therefore cost, one instance of which illustrates\r\nthe almost incredible potentialities in scientific economy.\r\n\r\nA block of cylinders, which takes eleven hours to bore by hand, is\r\nbored in two hours by automatic machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD YET TO LEARN THE LESSON OF ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nWill the world as a whole ever learn thoroughly the lesson of what the\r\nsaving of time means in its equivalent of money? Full realization\r\nof this is practically confined in this day and generation to some\r\nmanufacturers, and to most efficiency experts. But the great mass does\r\nnot acutely see it.\r\n\r\nThe farmer knows that if he takes four hours to go to town when it is\r\nnot necessary, he has lost the money represented by four hours\xe2\x80\x99 work.\r\nThat is plain to him, but it does not strike him that taking four hours\r\nto haul a load of grain to town by horses when it would take only one\r\nhour to do it by motor truck is throwing money away, and is an economic\r\nwaste only in another form. Nor does he quickly see that a motor truck\r\nwill perform service more economically than the horse, including\r\ncheaper cost of maintenance.\r\n\r\nHe also appears unable to get the same viewpoint on the economic loss\r\nby bad roads, that he does of wasting four hours to go needlessly to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe farmer has long had demonstration of the economic superiority of\r\nthe mechanical reaper over the hand cradle, that of the mechanical\r\nthresher over the flail, and that of the drill over sowing by hand. But\r\nhe is slow to see that the motor truck is superior to the horse and a\r\nfactor in greater economy as the reaper, the thresher and the drill\r\nwere superior to man, while at the same time his liberator from the\r\nhardest types of labor, and an economic saving to boot.\r\n\r\nWhen all farmers learn the full facts of the superiority of motor\r\nmechanism over horses, only one instance of which is that their cost\r\nper mile haulage is 16-2/3 cents, against 30-7/10 cents for the horse,\r\na wider use will result. It is only the highly developed efficiency\r\nexpert who yet can count a minute of time in its equivalent of cents,\r\nand an hour in its equivalent of dollars. The automobile industry has\r\nhad the benefit of the highest quality of efficiency generalship.\r\n\r\nChalmers was making $70,000 a year with the National Cash Register\r\nCompany when an automobile company secured him by promising more.\r\nFlanders was offered by Ford, in addition to his salary, a bonus of\r\n$20,000 if, in the first year of his administration, he would turn out\r\n10,000 cars. By installing the first automatic machine tool system,\r\nwhich itself was mechanical co-operation, Flanders collected the bonus.\r\n\r\nNo industry, except perhaps oil or steel, has paid men such salaries,\r\nbonuses and commissions as has that of the automobile.\r\n\r\nCo-operation by the automobile industry has been pursued in its public\r\nshows for seventeen years\xe2\x80\x94the period of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s greatest\r\nstrides\xe2\x80\x94beginning with the first one in 1900 in Madison Square Garden,\r\nNew York. The Seventeenth annual auto show was that in New York and\r\nChicago in January, 1917.\r\n\r\nThere are many lines of industrial production in which to this day the\r\nfactors have not gotten together in co-operation, lines in which each\r\nproducer is working alone, and it is noticeable in many of them that\r\ndevelopment is slow and advancement tardy.\r\n\r\nThe automobile makers early applied the principle of co-operation\r\nby formal association. They organized the National Association of\r\nAutomobile Manufacturers to advertise automobiles at the first auto\r\nshow in New York, and to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage general practices of mutual\r\nbenefit,\xe2\x80\x9d a statement of principles that is brief but sweeping.\r\n\r\nStimulating influences in the formation of this, one of the earliest,\r\nand one of the most comprehensive and sincere co-operative industrial\r\nassociations, were the necessity for presenting a united front, which\r\nlegislation adverse to the automobile created, and of popularizing and\r\ninspiring confidence in an innovation. Co-operation was further made\r\nimperative by the necessity for better roads. Had the roads of the\r\nUnited States been better than they were when the automobile first\r\ncame into being, the industry might by now be able to write its annual\r\nproduction in larger figures than 1,600,000 cars made in 1916.\r\n\r\nThat the automobile associations have the true principle of\r\nco-operation and not the semi-true or false variety, is evidenced by\r\nthe fact that their co-operative efforts have been from the start for\r\nthe benefit of the industry as a whole and not for the benefit of\r\nmembers of the associations alone. They have always admitted to their\r\ncouncils all manufacturers, whether association members or not, and\r\nco-operated on a free and full basis.\r\n\r\nBroad liberalism has been practiced. The many young men engaged in the\r\nindustry have been credited with this. Coming into the business arena\r\nat a late date, they were not handicapped by prejudices and hardening\r\nof the arteries of open-minded thought. They believed in the principle\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cone for all, and all for one,\xe2\x80\x9d which is the keynote of co-operation.\r\n\r\nAs the world has these men to thank for the constantly enlarging\r\npleasures and comforts of the automobile, so it has them to thank for\r\nsuch good roads as there are, for it is as certain that automobiles\r\nhave improved roads as it is that automobiles exist.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the National Association of Automobile\r\nManufacturers was followed by that of the co-operative Association of\r\nLicensed Automobile Owners, organized to resist the tightening of the\r\nclasp of the licensor of the Selden patent rights, and by the Society\r\nof Automobile Engineers, and still later by the American Motor Car\r\nManufacturers Association. The Automobile Board of Trade followed,\r\nand today the trade association is the National Automobile Chamber of\r\nCommerce. Fostering trade, reforming abuses and promoting harmony, were\r\nsteadily the aims of all the organizations, and how well they have done\r\nit is attested by the fact that no association of producers has better\r\ndemonstrated and more completely justified the valuable principle of\r\ntrue co-operation.\r\n\r\nStandardization in the automobile business has never discouraged\r\nindividuality of the manufacturers in the essentials of form or speed.\r\nIt was confined to those directions where appearance was not important.\r\nIt never extended to bodies, stream lines or designs that would deprive\r\na manufacturer of distinctions and selling points.\r\n\r\nIt is standardization of detail\xe2\x80\x94uniformity of screws, locks, washers,\r\nspring and bearing parts, water connections, etc. Co-operation\r\nhas been practiced intelligently, and the result has been that\r\nstandardization favored economical manufacturing by creating a large\r\ndemand, calling for quantities that fostered specialization in parts by\r\nmanufacturers, with resulting low cost to the automobile maker. It also\r\nleft him free to center his efforts, energy and capital on production\r\nin quantity, and himself get down the price of the finished automobile.\r\n\r\nTo the thinker, one of the most interesting features of the automobile\r\nindustry is this example it has given to the world of efficiency and\r\nco-operation. We are not surprised at efficiency in the steel business\r\nor the oil business, because they are industries conducted practically\r\nby one man power; and if autocratic rule is not efficient, its last\r\nexcuse for being might appear to have ceased to exist; but to find\r\nseveral hundred different manufacturers with divergent ambitions,\r\nideals and interests benevolently engaged in co-operative competition,\r\njustifies, it would seem, that optimism which sees the world as growing\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nCertainly if \xe2\x80\x9cby their works ye shall know them,\xe2\x80\x9d the progress made\r\nby the automobile industry in the short space of time it has played\r\nthe star part on the industrial stage, has been the most splendid\r\ndemonstration of the value in commercial industrialism of the\r\ntolerant, broad minded type of co-operation, coupled with efficiency.\r\nIt is an example of the value of harmonious co-ordination of the\r\ndiffering efforts of man in advancing the material progress of the\r\nworld, and in the case of the automobile industry, the best assurance\r\nof its continued advance as the moving force in the production of one\r\nof the greatest and most beneficial forms, not alone of transportation,\r\nbut of mind culture, of healthful relaxation and of sane recreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nAUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AS AN INVESTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA dozen years ago dictionary publishers vied with one another to be the\r\nfirst to announce that new editions of their wordbooks contained the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToday the automobile industry is the fourth in magnitude\xe2\x80\x94only three\r\nothers that are larger.\r\n\r\nIs your imagination equal to the task of forming a vivid picture of the\r\ntremendous activity that has been maintained to produce such results in\r\nso short a time?\r\n\r\nDo you know of any other industry in which money could have been at\r\nwork in as great a creative capacity? We will not say in a capacity to\r\nproduce immediate profits, because so far the automobile industry has\r\nbeen largely in the building, in the creative state.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 we produced 3,700 automobiles, in this country. In 1915\r\nwe produced 842,249 cars, and in 1916 the production reached the\r\nunexpected number of 1,617,708 cars.\r\n\r\nThe value of the production in 1899 was $4,750,000, or about $1,283 a\r\ncar. In 1916 the value was $972,336,400, an average of a little over\r\n$601 a car.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, also, we produced 92,130 commercial vehicles, valued at\r\n$157,000,000.\r\n\r\nAnd this is not all. A comprehensive survey of the automobile industry\r\nwill include the industries that the automobile has created, as\r\nmanufacturing tires and accessories, and not to forget the enlarged\r\nmarket for gasoline and oil. As the jokesmiths have it, \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\noriginal cost, but the upkeep that counts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor illustration, in the matter of tires, C. H. Williams, of the\r\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Company, who is in a position to know, said\r\nthat in 1916 the motorists of the United States took from their wheels\r\nand replaced some 9,000,000 tires, representing an expenditure in that\r\nyear of about $300,000,000 for tires.\r\n\r\nAny motorist can draw from his experience and compare the expense for\r\ntires with that for gasoline, and from these tire expense figures\r\narrive at a reasonably accurate estimate of the tremendous amount of\r\nmoney that was used in 1916 in paying for gasoline to run automobiles.\r\n\r\nBy way of an interpolation, it may here be remarked that these tire\r\nfigures show that there is one problem in the automobile industry that\r\nthe engineers still have to solve, and that is to produce a wheel that\r\nwill give satisfactory service without requiring a pneumatic rubber\r\ntire.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE ORIGINAL CAPITAL INVESTED.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable thing about the automobile industry is that, in\r\ncomparison with its present magnitude, there has been but little\r\noriginal capital invested in it. Today the industry represents a large\r\ninvestment, to be sure, but the bulk of it is made up of profits on\r\nthe original small investment. Companies started with small original\r\ncapitals, made money, and used some of it to enlarge plants and\r\nincrease outputs, until today we have the gigantic institutions that\r\nsome of these companies are.\r\n\r\nThe automobile industry has been and is one of the most convincing of\r\nmodern proofs of the efficacy of the science of investment in operation.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few years of experimenting, before the engineers\r\nproduced a car that would run in a reasonably satisfactory manner,\r\nthe industry offered investors only what might have been called the\r\ninventor\xe2\x80\x99s chance. These years were followed by a short period devoted\r\nto determining whether there was a market for the automobile.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of experimenting and determining the market the\r\naverage person could not be expected to become very enthusiastic\r\nover an investment in the industry. The average person has not clear\r\nvision in matters of this kind, and, lacking vision, he can not bring\r\nimagination to his aid.\r\n\r\nAnd in those early days it required clear vision, good imagination\r\nand exceptional ability to reason from probability to fact to see the\r\ncoming greatness of the automobile industry.\r\n\r\nA few courageous men had this vision and this ability, and to them is\r\ndue all credit for the establishing of the industry. In time others\r\nmight have done it, but these men did it.\r\n\r\nThe making and marketing of automobiles that would run had but fairly\r\nbegun when their popularity became so manifest that even an average\r\nperson could see that the automobile industry was bound to become great\r\nand profitable.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was an opportunity for scientific investment that was\r\nprodigious in possibilities.\r\n\r\nThose who were intelligent enough to see it and progressive and\r\ncourageous enough to avail themselves of it, and did so, today form\r\nanother set of rich men.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY IN GETTING CAPITAL.\r\n\r\nThe industry had great difficulty in getting capital. It was a new\r\nline, a new venture. Bankers and other \xe2\x80\x9cconservatives\xe2\x80\x9d could see\r\nnothing in it. They used their pet weapon of crying \xe2\x80\x9cspeculation\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chazard\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d, and so on, to keep people from investing in it, and,\r\nof course, did not invest in it themselves, or aid it in any way to get\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nBut since the beginning of this century, when the automobile industry\r\nbegan growing, many of our people have, among many other things, built\r\nthe great automobile industry into what it is, and made money. Not only\r\nthis, but they will build it still greater, and make still more money.\r\n\r\nBefore we get through with this little analysis we will see that the\r\nautomobile industry has not been more than half built thus far, and\r\nthat the really big profits in it are yet to come, because so far much\r\nof the profits have been used in building the industry.\r\n\r\nThis industry is, therefore, a fertile field for scientific investment.\r\nMany companies that are quite well established need more capital to\r\nenlarge their activities, and there are comparatively new companies,\r\nand there will be more, having very good propositions in which the\r\nprudent investor can find excellent openings for putting a little money\r\nat work under advantageous conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEALERS PUT UP THEIR OWN MONEY.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the early financiering of the automobile industry, it\r\nwould be unjust not to mention the aid that automobile dealers gave\r\nit. It is a fact that if dealers had not supported it in the way they\r\ndid, it would not be where it is today.\r\n\r\nBankers who could have furnished the money and should have done so, did\r\nnothing. They were too \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d to recognize a new industry.\r\n\r\nAnd so dealers stepped into the breach and became bankers to the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIn the days when the automobile manufacturer was confronted with the\r\nproblem of getting money to pay for making cars for which he had or\r\ncould get orders, some financiering genius devised the plan of giving\r\nthe dealer exclusive territory for the sale of a car. In return the\r\ndealer placed an order for a certain number of cars to be delivered in\r\nsmall lots from month to month throughout the period of the agency.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration for this exclusive agency was that the dealer\r\nmade a cash deposit on each car at the time of entering into the\r\ncontract. The monthly shipments were then made C.O.D. for the balance\r\ndue on the cars in each shipment.\r\n\r\nThe advance deposit enabled the manufacturer to make cars for the first\r\nshipment, and the collection on the shipment enabled him to make cars\r\nfor the second shipment, and so on.\r\n\r\nTo manufacture and sell 1,617,708 cars in a year, as we did last year,\r\nappears like an impossible task, especially when we consider that only\r\na negligible number was sold abroad.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that nearly all the manufacturers, especially those of\r\npopular cars, could have sold many more, had they had the facilities to\r\nmake them.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this condition some persons of narrow vision were\r\nwondering if there was a further market for cars, and were talking\r\nlearnedly, as they thought, about the point of \xe2\x80\x9csaturation\xe2\x80\x9d having been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the big men in the industry were saying nothing.\r\nInstead of talking, they were laying their plans to make and sell twice\r\nas many cars in 1917 as in 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION NOT YET AT ITS HEIGHT.\r\n\r\nThere will come a time when the automobile industry will reach its\r\nheight in production, but that time has not yet arrived, nor is it\r\nwithin calculable distance.\r\n\r\nStatisticians show us that there are over 5,000,000 rich people in this\r\ncountry. Many of these have, and more of them will want, each several\r\ncars, each of a different type and for a different purpose.\r\n\r\nWe have about 8,000,000 farms. Many farmers already have cars, but only\r\na few compared with the many who will have them as soon as they have\r\nbecome convinced of their utilitarian value aside from pleasure. The\r\nfarmer is a practical person and \xe2\x80\x9cmust be shown.\xe2\x80\x9d Give it time, and the\r\nautomobile will prove itself to him.\r\n\r\nThen we have several million persons who can not be classed among the\r\nrich, but who are in such reasonably comfortable circumstances that\r\ngradually they will become owners of popular priced cars.\r\n\r\nAnd we must not forget the element that is \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping up with Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThose of this class will also pay toll to the automobile industry.\r\n\r\nAnd so far only between three and four million cars, including pleasure\r\nand commercial cars, are registered in this country.\r\n\r\nTalk about the point of saturation. As yet it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t begun \xe2\x80\x9ccasting its\r\nshadow before\xe2\x80\x9d, much less having arrived.\r\n\r\nNor does it require prophetic vision to say at this time that the\r\ncommercial car is destined in due time to surpass the pleasure car in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nSo far the commercial car has but fairly been tested. In 1915 we\r\nproduced 50,369 commercial cars. In 1916 the number reached 92,130.\r\nFrom now on this branch of the industry is likely to increase more\r\nrapidly than did that of the pleasure car.\r\n\r\nIt has already been proved that the commercial car has a possible\r\nlarger field than has the pleasure car.\r\n\r\nA man may not feel that he can afford a pleasure car, but his business\r\nis such that a commercial car is profitable in it.\r\n\r\nThen again a man may have two or three pleasure cars, but in his\r\nbusiness he may have use for two or three hundred commercial cars.\r\n\r\nThe business world is just beginning to realize the value of the\r\ncommercial car. Not only does it cost less by the ton or trip to haul\r\nin a motor car than with horses, but more can be accomplished in the\r\nsame time. The teamster may require six hours to make a trip that the\r\nmotor car driver can make in less than an hour. Business men, great and\r\nsmall, will soon learn this, and the commercial car industry will grow\r\naccordingly. In fact, the demand is already ahead of the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACTOR AS A PROMISING INVESTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe tractor, a motor vehicle used to haul other vehicles or machinery,\r\nis a product that must also be classed as a branch of the automobile\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIt has already been demonstrated that a good tractor is the lowest\r\npriced power that can be applied in the work of hauling tools or\r\nmachinery that must move forward to do their work. Also that it is the\r\nonly form of power with which a man can perform a prodigious amount of\r\nwork in a day.\r\n\r\nThe tractor industry is, comparatively, in its infancy, but it has\r\nalready assumed substantial proportions. It seems destined, in one form\r\nand another, to surpass the commercial car industry.\r\n\r\nRecently one of the Ford Motor Company\xe2\x80\x99s leading engineers secured a\r\npatent on a device to convert an automobile into a tractor. This is\r\ndone by substituting tractor wheels in place of the rear wheels of the\r\nautomobile, and by reducing the power transmission gear so that the\r\npower of the motor will be used in pulling a load instead of giving\r\nspeed. In other words, the car in the form of a tractor will be run\r\nvery slow and the power saved in this way will be applied to pulling\r\nthe load.\r\n\r\nThe wheels may be changed in a few minutes from pleasure to tractor,\r\nand from tractor to pleasure. With this device the farmer can have his\r\ncar for pleasure and business trips, and when he gets ready to do farm\r\nwork he can convert it into a tractor to do the work of half a dozen\r\nhorses or more, and at very much less expense.\r\n\r\nA valuable feature of this invention is that when a car becomes worn\r\nout for pleasure use it will still be as good as a new one to form a\r\ntractor with this device.\r\n\r\nThe device was thoroughly tested in all kinds of farm work throughout\r\nthe season of 1916, and found to work perfectly and highly\r\nsatisfactorily in every way.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the automobile industry has surprised some of our\r\nablest economists, and it has given the long-faced, wiseacre,\r\nconservative financier a clean knock-out blow.\r\n\r\nHaving no precedent to guide them but human nature, the economists were\r\nunable to arrive at satisfactory conclusions in regard to the future of\r\nthe industry and it ran away from their estimates.\r\n\r\nMr. J. George Frederick, of the New York Business Bourse, is perhaps\r\nin possession of more business facts, figures and data of all kinds\r\nthan anyone else in this country, and is regarded as one of the highest\r\nauthorities on business economics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWriting on this phase of the automobile industry in the October, 1915,\r\nnumber of the American Review of Reviews, Mr. Frederick said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith 2,000,000 automobile owners today, and every indication that\r\nthe annual production will be more than the 703,000 produced this\r\nyear, we face in plain facts a probable annual sale of over 1,000,000\r\nautomobiles every year, on an average, for the next five years at\r\nleast. Until the automobile became popular there were about 1,000,000\r\ncarriages sold each year, and as these were undoubtedly sold mainly to\r\nrural and suburban population there is sound reason to believe that\r\n2,000,000 automobiles per year is not an extravagant future prediction\r\nin the slightly more distant future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION RAN AWAY FROM ESTIMATES.\r\n\r\nNote that this was written at least three months before the close of\r\nthe year 1915. The production of automobiles for that year, as we have\r\nseen, was 139,249 greater than that given by Mr. Frederick at the time\r\nhe wrote.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing in Mr. Frederick\xe2\x80\x99s prediction for the future\r\nis that the industry ran away from his estimate the first year after\r\nhe made his prediction. He prophesied a production of 1,000,000\r\nautomobiles a year for the next five years. The following year, 1916,\r\nthe production reached 1,617,708 cars. This is not against him, because\r\nthe automobile industry is going forward by such leaps and bounds as\r\nto smash all conservatism. His estimate but indicates that his further\r\nprediction of a probable production later of 2,000,000 automobiles a\r\nyear is likely to be more than fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we must take into consideration that the earlier\r\nmade cars are beginning to wear out and are being replaced by new ones.\r\n\r\nAlso that many persons who bought so-called cheap cars at first are\r\ndiscarding them and buying higher priced new ones.\r\n\r\nThe time will come, of course, when the sale of automobiles to new\r\nusers will begin to decrease, but as these sales decrease the sales of\r\ncars to take the place of old ones will increase. When we reach the\r\ntime when the decrease of the one will equal the increase of the other\r\nwe will arrive, approximately, at the point of saturation that is now\r\nworrying timid and unimaginative persons, and not until then. Every\r\nfeature of the industry indicates that we have not travelled more than\r\nhalf the distance to reach that point. A more rational estimate is that\r\nwe have not travelled much more than a fourth of the distance.\r\n\r\nUntil we reach that point the automobile industry will be in the\r\nformative period, in the creative state. It will be growing larger\r\nand larger, and will be earning more and more from year to year. But\r\nsome of the earnings will have to be kept in the business to acquire\r\nadditional equipment and as a greater working capital. But earnings\r\nused in this way will become additional assets back of automobile\r\nsecurities to enhance their values\xe2\x80\x94to create accretive values.\r\n\r\nWhen the saturation point is finally reached the industry will settle\r\ndown to be one of our most stable and profitable manufacturing lines.\r\nNot until then can the tremendous profit possibilities in it be\r\ndefinitely reckoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLIER THE INVESTMENT, GREATER THE PROFITS.\r\n\r\nThese conditions being true, it should be clear that the earlier an\r\ninvestment is made in the industry, the greater will be the profits.\r\nSpectacular profits will be made before the saturation point is\r\nreached, and to get all the tremendous accretive values that accrue\r\nin this industry the investment must be made at the beginning. The\r\nfurther removed from the beginning the investment is made, the more the\r\ninvestment will cost and the lesser will be the accretive value as well\r\nas the income on the investment.\r\n\r\nThis is a fundamental principle in the science of investment.\r\n\r\nWhen the saturation point is reached manufacturing automobiles will\r\nsettle into an industry to supply a daily necessity. There will be\r\nkeener competition, the price of cars will be lowered, and the profit\r\non each will be correspondingly less. The industry will be similar to\r\nthose of making hats, plows and shoes. It will carry a substantial\r\nprofit, but not a spectacular one as now and for many years to come.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that, large as it already is, the automobile industry\r\nis still in its comparative infancy\xe2\x80\x94that it has before it a reasonable\r\npossibility of more than doubling its present proportions.\r\n\r\nWhile there are several large companies that will continue to produce\r\nlarge numbers of cars each year, it is not reasonable to expect that\r\nthese companies will grow from this time forward as they have in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the industry may rather be looked for in younger and\r\nsmaller companies that will put out cars to meet some particular demand.\r\n\r\nThe investor in the industry could scarcely be said to be using good\r\njudgment if he undertook to help to build a company to put out a car\r\nto compete with the Ford car, for illustration; that is, to put out a\r\ncar at the same price and that he would expect the public to buy in\r\npreference to the Ford. It may be possible that the thing can be done,\r\nbut off hand it would seem like taking an undue chance.\r\n\r\nNor is a Ford proposition necessary to make money in the automobile\r\nindustry. This has been demonstrated sufficiently.\r\n\r\nThe Ford car fills a particular want of many people, but in the main it\r\nis a builder of the industry as applied to more elaborate and higher\r\npriced cars. It prepares a market for others.\r\n\r\nThe investor should seek to get into the business of supplying the\r\ndemand in that market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS CONFERRED BY THE AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the automobile is one of the greatest boons to mankind will\r\nprobably be admitted if all its benefits are fully understood.\r\n\r\nThe best teacher, it has been demonstrated, is one\xe2\x80\x99s own experience. In\r\nlearning anything, the mind can never grasp the lesson it is told, with\r\nthe same understanding it receives when the lesson is visualized by the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nTravel is acknowledged to be a good educator and to broaden the mind.\r\nThis is because the eye sees and takes its own impressions, and does\r\nnot depend on the impressions of others. Reading books of travel never\r\ninstruct as does travelling itself.\r\n\r\nThe automobile is a healthful, exhilarating method of conveying people\r\nto persons, places and scenes that, before the automobile, they knew of\r\nonly by hearsay, or by reading of them.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the extent to which this informs and instructs, we need\r\nonly go back in memory to the isolated farm of a quarter of a century\r\nago, and vision the limited horizon of the general knowledge at first\r\nhand of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s family. Practically all the current knowledge they\r\nhad was from reading, occasionally going to town or through visitors\r\nwhose appearance was rare and made at long intervals. Seeing a new face\r\nin those days was a rarity.\r\n\r\nThe situation with a majority of the people in the country, before the\r\nautomobile, was very much like the isolated farm family. It was like\r\nthat of the entire country before the advent of the railroad.\r\n\r\nNo greater agencies for instruction in first hand knowledge than the\r\nrailroad, the steamboat and the telephone had been introduced into\r\ncivilization up to the time of the automobile. Now the motor car\r\npenetrates into places where the railroad, the steamboat, or even the\r\ntelephone does not go.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIUM OF DISTRIBUTION OF KNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\nExchange of ideas between people is the life of wider knowledge, as the\r\nexchange of commodities is the life of world trade, and the automobile\r\nis the medium of exchanging information as money is a medium of\r\nexchange of commodities.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the greatest advancement of the human race has\r\nbeen made in groups; and the larger the groups, the higher the thought,\r\nand the more progressive the accomplishments have been. Big cities have\r\nsurpassed small towns; small towns have been in advance of the country.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is the greater opportunity afforded by numbers\r\nfor the exchange of ideas and knowledge. The citizen of Rome or of\r\nVenice had the advantage of personal contact with numbers of citizens\r\nwhich the isolated rural Latin was denied, as the citizen of London,\r\nParis, New York or Chicago has, before his own eyes, the thought and\r\nachievements of millions which the citizens of the country only hear of\r\nor read about.\r\n\r\nThe railroad first enabled the resident of the country to go to the\r\nsmall town, and the resident of the small town to go to the big city,\r\nand by personal contact gather the fruits of himself seeing the results\r\nof community or group work, which, before, had been monopolized by his\r\ncity brother.\r\n\r\nThe automobile supplements this work of the railroad, and is even\r\nmore widespread as it enables more frequent visits to be made, and\r\npenetrates regions the railroad does not reach. What was a frontier is\r\nnow a suburb, while the suburb has become the downtown. The motor car\r\nhas opened up the far reaches as nothing else has done.\r\n\r\nBigotry and prejudice are the fruits of ignorance. Where knowledge is\r\nthey will not abide. In enabling people to acquire knowledge in their\r\nown way\xe2\x80\x94the way that most impresses knowledge on them\xe2\x80\x94the automobile\r\nis changing the thought and the habits of the denizens of the entire\r\ncountry. It is broadening the human mind, by giving it a solid\r\nfoundation to work on.\r\n\r\nIn the courts of law, among judges, lawyers and court attendants, it\r\nis notorious that no two witnesses ever testify exactly to the same\r\nset of facts. There is a variation of detail, and many times there has\r\nbeen such a difference in the statement of material facts that the\r\ndispensing of exact justice has been defeated.\r\n\r\nThis condition is ascribed to the fact that few people are trained\r\nobservers. The automobile is correcting this popular defect more than\r\nany other one agency\xe2\x80\x94by education. It is educating people to exact\r\nobservation and precise knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERALIZING THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nThe automobile is a factor in creating open minds. When one travels\r\nextensively, notions and prejudices, based on false conceptions, are\r\namended and revised by observance of the facts. In this respect the\r\nautomobile is conferring on the masses a benefit which, before its\r\nadvent, was confined to the classes. Time was when broad and liberal\r\nviews were generally the possession of the rich, who alone could afford\r\nto indulge in contact with their fellows many miles distant. Now the\r\nautomobile has aided in making broader views the possession of anybody\r\nable to own a motor car.\r\n\r\nThe degree in which the social life of the world has been benefited\r\nby the automobile is the favorite theme of the enthusiast on the\r\nautomobile\xe2\x80\x99s advantage to mankind. This phase of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s value\r\nis of less importance than is its benefit in informing and enlarging\r\nthe horizon of the mind, but the social advantages which the use of\r\nthe motor car confers are not to be underrated in an age when the most\r\nfavorable mental conditions are recognized as of equal importance to a\r\ndesirable physical state.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of the human race is added to by social enjoyment, and\r\nthe automobile is a most important link between isolation and human\r\nintercourse. It has rendered the means of communication between\r\npeople so easy and pleasant that it has encouraged and increased\r\ntheir association. Everybody is brought into greater accessibility\r\nto everybody else. The farmer with his family can visit his neighbor\r\nfarmer and his family, many times now to once formerly.\r\n\r\nWhat was formerly a long, arduous journey taken at the expense of\r\npleasure as well as of time, is now an exhilarating spin. The farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife and daughters can now go to town more frequently, and multiply the\r\nnumber of their visits to friends. The automobile is the emancipator of\r\nthe farm woman, bringing the scope of her activities out of the narrow\r\ncircle of routine drudgery and monotony into the larger circle of\r\ninspiring activities.\r\n\r\nFarm women\xe2\x80\x99s clubs have been given an impetus, through the fact that a\r\nwoman may attend one in the afternoon with the assurance that by the\r\nuse of the automobile she can return home in sufficient time to get\r\ndinner, which she could not do by the use of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTOR IN PROMOTING SOCIABILITY.\r\n\r\nThe city man\xe2\x80\x99s wife in the suburbs can visit her friends oftener\r\nand more quickly, and the facility of speedy movement has given to\r\nsuburbanites the benefit of the last acts at the theatre and the opera,\r\nwhereas, before the automobile, they missed them in order to catch the\r\nlast train.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of clergy has been immeasurably enhanced by the automobile,\r\nwhich, also, in addition to being itself an educational agent, has\r\nemployed its speed and facilities in economizing time to increase the\r\nattendance in the schools. There are districts in the United States\r\nwhere children can not reach school in time without the use of the\r\nautomobile.\r\n\r\nWhat the automobile does for the city dweller, in enabling him to see\r\nthe last act at the theatre or hear the last act of the opera, it does\r\nfor the people of the farm in enabling them to spare the time to attend\r\ndances, sociables, entertainments and motion picture shows. Where\r\nformerly the time required to drive a horse made it impossible to spare\r\nthe time, now time is scarcely a factor. The change must inevitably\r\nreact to the advantage and benefit of humanity, if all work and no play\r\nmakes Jack a dull boy.\r\n\r\nThe health advantage of the automobile is a subject on which there is\r\na difference of opinion among medics. The ordinary layman, however, is\r\ndisposed to cast his verdict in its favor in this respect also. Some\r\nphysicians have expressed the opinion that the only respect in which\r\nthe automobile is noticeably not a benefit is in the matter of health.\r\nSome of them think it does not give people enough exercise, and that at\r\nthe rate its use is increasing it will not be long before man loses his\r\nability to use his legs!\r\n\r\nIt would be a catastrophe indeed if the human race, through the\r\nautomobile, reverted to the condition when primitive man, according to\r\nthe Darwinian theory, swung by his hairy arms from tree limb to tree\r\nlimb, using his feet only as a stabilizer. But nobody, unless a writer\r\nfor a newspaper Sunday magazine section, is likely to maintain this\r\nseriously, and he only pretends to be serious.\r\n\r\nWhatever man loses in disuse of his legs by riding, as compared with\r\nwalking, may be said to be made up for by his use of them on levers of\r\nautomobiles and in the other exercise or operation of a car. The fresh\r\nair and the sunlight\xe2\x80\x94the great outdoors\xe2\x80\x94are the big health factors in\r\nmotoring, and man will go on taking a chance to experience these and\r\nother delights the automobile has to give.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS AN ELEMENT IN EUGENICS.\r\n\r\nAnd as still further offsetting the possibilities of decay of the human\r\nlegs, which certain physicians predict, more constructive medical men\r\nhave discovered that automobiling is becoming a factor in one phase of\r\neugenics. It may not receive endorsement as a benefit in all eugenics\r\nas long as the charge can be made that since the use of the motor\r\ncar the birthrate in Kansas has decreased, the discoverer accounting\r\nfor this alleged fact on the theory that the expense of keeping an\r\nautomobile discourages Kansans from assuming the expense of large\r\nfamilies, but in one direction it is attempted to prove that the breed\r\nof certain Americans is being improved by the automobile, and in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the country, particularly the Southeastern states\r\nclose intermarriage is said to have been, in part, due to the inferior\r\nfacilities for transportation, before the automobile came into use.\r\nYoung men, it is said, courted and married their sweethearts, in the\r\ndays when the buggy was king of local communication, within an average\r\nradius of five to ten miles, which accounted for people in those\r\nsections being cousins or otherwise related to one another.\r\n\r\nNow that the automobile makes a thirty-mile or fifty-mile radius the\r\nequivalent of the five-mile or ten-mile buggy radius, the swains are\r\nseeking mates further afield, thus getting away from alliances with\r\nrelatives, and there is a consequent decrease in the mixing of blood\r\nstrains.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, tally one more in the score of benefits for the\r\nautomobile, for it is the verdict of science that intermarriage between\r\nthose of the same blood does not produce the best types, any more than\r\ndoes the interbreeding of other animals.\r\n\r\nBut in enumerating the benefits of the automobile its economic value\r\neasily comes next in importance to its service in imparting knowledge.\r\nIts health value may be a matter of difference of opinion, and its\r\nsocial benefits are comparative, but there can be no dispute about its\r\neducational value, and still less about its economic worth.\r\n\r\nThe factor time has taken on a new meaning and significance with the\r\nautomobile\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments in speed. Time is a vital element in\r\nthe affairs of life. If the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s educational value can be\r\nexpressed by the adage, \xe2\x80\x9cSeeing is believing\xe2\x80\x9d, its economic value can\r\nbe similarly expressed by the adage, \xe2\x80\x9cTime is money\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART PLAYED IN ECONOMICS.\r\n\r\nTime is likewise life under some circumstances, and because of this\r\nfact, the professional men who were first to make practical use of the\r\nautomobile were physicians, commandeering it in behalf of life itself.\r\nHow many lives have been saved by the automobile, which would have\r\nbeen lost through the slow going gig or phaeton, it is not possible to\r\nsay, because there is, of course, no exact record, but the number is\r\nlarge. The mortality of today among people is greatly reduced from that\r\nof twenty years ago. The advance of science has, of course, brought\r\nthis about, but the automobile is an important instrument of medical\r\nscience, just as are the X-ray, the stethoscope and the pulmotor.\r\n\r\nAnd the same cause\xe2\x80\x94the element of time\xe2\x80\x94which operated in the adoption\r\nof the automobile by the physician to the human body, has forced the\r\nveterinarian to use the automobile. This is irony\xe2\x80\x94for the horse\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nanother nail in the equine coffin, but it is at the same time another\r\ndemonstration of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s superiority in efficiency over that\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe farmer demands that the veterinarian shall come in an auto to\r\nattend his sick horses or cattle, because he will not take the chance\r\nof death through delay. And this is scarcely gratitude\xe2\x80\x94by the farmer to\r\nthe horse\xe2\x80\x94but it is economic pressure.\r\n\r\nAt every turn in the road of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s advance, we see its\r\neconomic value. We see in cities that the big department store is able\r\nto cut down its delivery expense from $990 to $350 a day by using a\r\nfleet of motor trucks instead of horse drawn wagons; that coal, ice,\r\ngroceries, feed\xe2\x80\x94practically all commodities in cities\xe2\x80\x94can be delivered\r\nby motor trucks at a large saving of cost. Contractors, plumbers,\r\nplasterers, tinners, and craftsmen in substantially all lines,\r\nhave figured it out and concluded that with the facilities of the\r\nautomobile available, the horse is a distinct economic waste in their\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of similar economy by the farmer in the substitution\r\nof motor power for horse power have been indicated by many progressive\r\nfarmers who have by experiments demonstrated that the cost of hauling\r\nand cultivating with motor wagons and machinery is less than by using\r\nhorses, but the general economic saving by the use of the motor vehicle\r\nin hauling cannot get its fullest and conclusive demonstration until\r\nbetter roads are more numerous. Where roads are nearly perfect, results\r\nhave shown the cost of horse hauling to be 30 cents a ton, against 14\r\ncents a ton by motor truck, by the mile, figuring everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE IN GETTING BETTER ROADS.\r\n\r\nBy far the direction in which the automobile has forced on conviction\r\nmost strongly its economic potentialities, is in the matter of better\r\nroads. No greater tribute to the educational value of the automobile\r\ncould have been paid than was paid to it by President Wilson when he\r\nsigned the Federal Good Roads bill which puts $85,000,000 of national\r\nmoney against an equal amount by the states, into making better\r\nhighways. It was the popular demand for better roads, following the\r\ngeneral use of the automobile, that gave the country the improvements\r\nmade in roads in the last fifteen years, and it was the demand from the\r\nsame source for more of these improvements that resulted in the Federal\r\nGood Roads law.\r\n\r\nUntil the coming of the motor car the good roads issue possessed little\r\nvitality. For seventy-five years the Federal government exercised a\r\npassive policy toward building permanent highways. Railroads pushed\r\ninto virgin territory, cities sprang up along the right of way, but the\r\nrural arteries of travel remained in the same hopeless condition as\r\nwhen the pioneers waded through them afoot or on horseback.\r\n\r\nWith the first motor car came the first feeble impulse to the good\r\nroads movement. The first cars were sold to city men, who very quickly\r\nfound out that where city pavements ended, there ended all hopes of\r\nfurther travel. Pneumatic tires availed nothing against trackless\r\nstretches of gumbo mud or corduroy roads. With the mechanical\r\nimprovements in motor cars, the owners chafed at their limitations and\r\ndemanded better state roads.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the agitation, many states have become active in\r\npromoting their own road systems, and quite a little has been\r\naccomplished in some localities; but the sum total of improved roads\r\nin the United States today is only 250,000 miles out of a total of\r\n2,275,000 miles of roads. The Federal roads bill will give an impetus\r\nto state work on roads, and as its appropriation covers the next five\r\nyears, 1922 should see a large increase in the miles of improved roads\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nThe results in benefit to the agriculture of the country in a general\r\nsystem of good roads, will be most felt through the facility it\r\nwill give the farmer in marketing his products. With the aid of the\r\nmotor truck, the farmer may be able to meet, in many cases, the\r\ncongestion-of-freight-by-railroad problem.\r\n\r\nAdding to its other benefits, the automobile promises to be an element\r\nin the reduction of the high cost of living, and if it does aid in this\r\nit will be in two directions, first, as a freight carrier, and, second,\r\nby displacing the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITATING THE PASSING OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\nA horse, it is estimated, consumes each year the production of five\r\nacres of land. There are 21,000,000 horses in the United States, and\r\ntherefore the fertility of 100,000,000 acres is enlisted annually in\r\nbehalf of this animal. If this area, which is as great as Ohio, Indiana\r\nand Illinois combined, were released from this burden, and the products\r\nwere human food, a very large addition would be made to the food\r\nstuffs of which the world is in such sore need.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of the horse is progressing at a very rapid rate\r\nin cities, and the prediction is made that it will come to an end\r\nultimately in the country, and that a horse in future will be only a\r\npet or an element in sport. Thomas A. Edison has decreed the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife for practical, general use, to be only ten years. Those who\r\nforesee his passing on the farm say that automobile engineers are\r\nworking on small tractors which will be practicable in the cultivation\r\nof farms as small as 60 acres, and that they will ultimately be gotten\r\ndown to a price which will not exceed the original cost and upkeep of a\r\nhorse, and will do more and better work in the field.\r\n\r\nThe list of benefits conferred by the automobile is incomplete, if its\r\nuse in war is omitted. It has been said that it saved France twice\r\nduring its latest war. When the onrush of Germans in 1914 brought them\r\nalmost within sight of Paris, General Gallieni, then Governor of Paris,\r\nrushed troops by the thousands in motor vehicles to the aid of General\r\nFoch. They turned the tide and made possible the victory of the Marne.\r\n\r\nMotor trucks saved Verdun. The German advance had cut the French\r\nrailway connections. Horse drawn wagons never could have brought the\r\nsupplies. Motor trucks did. Had there been no such things as motor\r\ntrucks, nothing, it is claimed, could have saved Verdun.\r\n\r\nIn war or peace, then, the automobile is a factor. As an agent in the\r\nadvance of civilization it occupies a secure place. It has doubled the\r\npopulation of at least one city, and has given new life to others.\r\n\r\nIn forcing good roads it has enhanced the value of agricultural land.\r\nIt is a well settled fact that the increase in selling price of farm\r\nlands through good main market roads is from one to three times the\r\ncost of the road improvements.\r\n\r\nThe likelihood is that with the increased use of the automobile,\r\nbenefits from it will multiply. These benefits are, naturally, not as\r\ngreat with only three and a half million automobiles in use as we can\r\nwell imagine they would be with the use of the motor car practically\r\nuniversal for passenger, hauling and farm cultivation purposes.\r\n\r\nMuch bigger things for the automobile than it has yet accomplished can\r\nbe safely predicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nREPORT ON AUTOMOBILES, AUTOMOBILE ACCESSORIES AND TIRE MANUFACTURERS\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSECURITIES FROM A FINANCIAL AND INVESTMENT STANDPOINT.\r\n\r\nCompiled specially for use in this book by THE BUSINESS BOURSE\r\nINTERNATIONAL, INC.

Houses were mortgaged and ruin\r\nwas accomplished for many who paid high prices and then could not stand\r\nmaintenance and repair cost.\r\n\r\nThe relative effect on business then became apparent. Bankers protested\r\nand entered complaint against the automobile as a degenerating factor\r\nin life. Automobile manufacturers expanded lavishly, over-capitalized,\r\nundertook to effect great stock-jobbing consolidations, until\r\nconservative financiers took steps to stop the harmful waste and\r\ninflation and many bubbles burst.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, therefore, stocks of the automobile group were\r\nlooked upon skeptically, and were scarcely known in the legitimate\r\nmarket before 1912, with the exception of a few scattered stocks, some\r\nof which are now altogether out of existence or merged in new companies.\r\n\r\nWhile stock trading did not come into general prominence until within\r\nthe last five years, it is agreed that economic conditions have had a\r\nbig influence in bringing about this recognition.\r\n\r\nIn further considering the outlook in this industry, it is necessary to\r\nanalyze the buying power of the population. This will have a decided\r\neffect upon stock activity, which the remarkable history of this\r\nindustry has placed in a class almost by itself.\r\n\r\nThe people of the country never before enjoyed the money earning\r\npossibilities now in order, but to offset this is the high cost of\r\nall articles going to make up the necessities and luxuries of our\r\nincreasingly complex modern existence.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 there were registered (mostly by buyers of an earning capacity\r\nof $3,000 or more) 48,000 automobiles. Since then registration has\r\nincreased 5,000 per cent, due to the changes in the average price\r\nof automobiles. Investigation shows that the average price of an\r\nautomobile in 1907 was $2,123, while in 1916 it dropped to $820.\r\n\r\n_The following chart shows the changes in the average price of\r\nautomobiles since 1904:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\nIn very few years this infant industry has grown to rank as one of the\r\nmost important in this country, and it is plain to see how conclusively\r\nthe industry\xe2\x80\x99s influence has produced an economic effect upon our\r\nnational life. The farmer\xe2\x80\x99s life has been made more attractive. Cities\r\nhave expanded into suburbs, thus affecting and influencing values on\r\nboth urban and suburban real estate. Good highways are demanded. Thus\r\nit can be recognized the strong hold this industry has upon the nation\r\nat large, nor do present signs indicate that it will cease to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITIES OF COMPANIES TRADED IN ON NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.\r\n\r\nIn making an analysis of this subject an expose along the following\r\nlines will disclose a definite basis upon which to make a survey of\r\nthe history of past activity in the securities of a given industry,\r\ncomparisons with other parallel industries, the present condition of\r\nmarkets for securities of these industries, and a forecast of what the\r\ngeneral tendencies are likely to be.\r\n\r\nThe securities of the companies manufacturing automobiles, automobile\r\naccessories, and tires which have been traded in on the New York Stock\r\nExchange for the years 1906, 1909, 1912 and 1916 are shown in the\r\nfollowing tabulation, which gives an interesting exhibit from which it\r\nis readily seen how this young giant of modern industry is the product\r\nof comparatively recent growth:\r\n\r\n                                      1916            1912\r\n         Name                     High    Low     High    Low\r\n  Ajax Rubber Co.                 89-1/8  63      .....   .....\r\n  Chandler Motor Co.             131      88      .....   .....\r\n  General Motors Co.

Instances like United States Motors Company\r\nand B. F. Goodrich Company may be cited as examples. The accessory\r\nshares have seen a general rise since first traded in, in 1912.\r\n\r\n_The following chart shows average price of automobile, automobile tire\r\nand automobile accessory manufacturing stocks traded in on the New York\r\nCurb for 1906-9-12-16:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\nSECURITIES ON VARIOUS EXCHANGES IN OTHER CITIES AND DATA FOR 1916.\r\n\r\nSecurities traded in on various stock exchanges of other cities show\r\nvery little activity or regularity.\r\n\r\nBelow is shown the trading in the great automobile center of the world.\r\n\r\n                        DETROIT.                      1916\r\n                                             High               Low\r\n  Auto Body Co.                                48-1/2            32\r\n  Chalmers Motor                              255                90\r\n  Chevrolet                                   277               171-1/8\r\n  Continental Motors                           42-1/8             7-1/2\r\n  Ford Motor Co. of Canada                    415               275\r\n  General Motors                              800               418\r\n    Preferred                                 127               112-1/2\r\n  Maxwell Motors                               95-1/8            57-5/8\r\n  Packard Motor                               260               160\r\n  Preferred                                   104-1/2           100-1/4\r\n  Paige-Detroit                                57-1/8            32\r\n  Reo Motor                                    47-1/2            32-1/4\r\n  Reo Truck                                    45-1/4            23-3/8\r\n  Studebaker                                  161-1/8           120-7/8\r\n\r\nCleveland shows greatest activity in the tire stock on account of its\r\nproximity to the great rubber center of Akron, Ohio.\r\n\r\n                                                       1916\r\n                                             High               Low\r\n  Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.               1,700               740\r\n  Goodrich Co.                                 78-1/2            60-3/8\r\n  Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.                  402               198\r\n  Portage Rubber Co.                          183-1/2            62-1/2\r\n  Republic Rubber Co.                         145               128-1/2\r\n  Swinehart Tire &amp; Rubber Co.                 110                79\r\n  White Motor Co.                              60                47-1/4\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL COMPANIES WHOSE SECURITIES ARE NOT GENERALLY TRADED IN.\r\n\r\nUntil the past two or three years, motor and motor accessory stocks\r\nwere traded in but little on the open market. Even today, when these\r\nsecurities are traded in much more generally, there is a large number\r\nof companies whose stocks are very closely held and it requires some\r\nunusual occurrence to loosen them for trading on the open market.\r\n\r\nA notable example of this is the Ford Motor Company. The Ford car\r\nis widely distributed, yet the two million dollar capital stock is\r\nalmost entirely held by seven men. Another case is the H. H. Franklin\r\nManufacturing Company, of Syracuse. This company has $1,800,000\r\noutstanding capital stock which is held largely by Mr. H. H. Franklin.\r\n\r\nFurther, out of a total of 81 companies reported upon (including the\r\ntwo above mentioned) at least 16, or practically 20 per cent, fall into\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cclosely held\xe2\x80\x9d class. Among these companies are the following:\r\n\r\n  Apperson Brothers\r\n  Consolidated Car Co.\r\n  Dodge Brothers\r\n  Federal Motor Truck\r\n  Ford Motor Co.\r\n  Ford Motor Co. of Canada\r\n  H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Co.\r\n  Gramm Motor Truck Co.\r\n  Haynes Auto Co.\r\n  Kissel Motor Car Co.\r\n  Mitchell Lewis Motor Co.\r\n  Mutual Motors Co.\r\n  Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co.\r\n  Republic Motor Truck Co.\r\n  Stearns Co.\r\n  Winton Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME LEADING EXAMPLES OF PRICES AND TERMS AND PROMOTION PLANS UPON\r\nWHICH SECURITIES WERE PUT OUT.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most notable examples of plans for flotation of\r\nsecurities was the 8 per cent cumulative convertible preferred stock\r\nof the Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company, offered by prominent brokers in\r\n1916. This stock must be redeemed at 125 up to the amount of cash paid\r\non common stock in excess of $5.00 a share in any year. The preferred\r\nis convertible into common stock, share for share, at the holder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noption (preferred stock $10,000,000) earnings five times preferred\r\ndividends; the common shares are without par value (common 250,000\r\nshares).\r\n\r\nAmong other issues by banking houses of New York and other cities may\r\nbe mentioned in 1912, General Motors Company\xe2\x80\x99s 6 per cent first lien\r\nsinking fund gold notes dated 1910, due 1915, $200,000,000 (since paid\r\noff); 1913 Chalmers Motor Company of Michigan, 7 per cent cumulative\r\npreferred stock (no bonds) $1,500,000, redeemable at $115 a share,\r\nearnings over 9-1/2 times preferred interest; company taken over by new\r\ncompany in 1916. January, 1916, Willys-Overland Company convertible 7\r\nper cent cumulative preferred stock, redeemable at $110, interest 6-1/2\r\ntimes earnings; November, 1916, Chalmers Motor Corporation of New York,\r\nshares at no par value, at $35 a share (264,000 shares), book value $29\r\na share, earnings, $5.40 a share; National Motor Car &amp; Vehicle Company\r\ncommon shares at no par value (80,000 shares), no bonds, no preferred\r\nstock. Offered at $42.50 a share, earnings old company equal to 12-1/2\r\nper cent on new stock.\r\n\r\nMost motor companies started with a small capitalization and business,\r\nand to provide additional working capital, as their business expanded,\r\nissued preferred or common stock.\r\n\r\nMost of the better grade issues were for preferred stock, usually\r\ncarrying with it a proviso that it could be retired at will at a\r\nstated price, some as high as $125.\r\n\r\nVery few companies in the motor field have any bonded debt. Some\r\ncompanies which incurred such indebtedness in the past have paid it\r\noff; for example, the General Motors Company, and the Pierce-Arrow\r\nMotor Car Company.\r\n\r\nThe issues of securities by established motor companies have, as a\r\nrule, shown large liquid assets, and earning capacity record, and have\r\nbeen of the same general class.\r\n\r\nIn the automobile accessory line many flotations were put out in 1916\r\nand a few in 1917, among which were:\r\n\r\n  (a) Edmunds &amp; Jones Corporation.\r\n  (b) Perlman Rim Corporation.\r\n  (c) Motor Products Corporation.\r\n  (d) Fischer Body Corporation.\r\n  (e) United Alloy Steel Corporation.\r\n  (f) Transue &amp; Williams Steel Forging Co.\r\n\r\n(a) Edmunds &amp; Jones Corporation (manufacturers of automobile lamps).\r\nThis corporation issued $1,000,000 worth of preferred 7 per cent\r\ncumulative stock (no bonds), redeemable at $120, earning over six times\r\npreferred dividends.\r\n\r\n(b) A somewhat unusual plan was the Perlman Rim Corporation\r\n(manufacturers of demountable automobile rims) which issued 100,000\r\nshares of stock of no par value, divided into two classes as follows:\r\n\r\n  Class \xe2\x80\x9cA,\xe2\x80\x9d having voting power....    3,000 shares\r\n  Common, no par value or voting power  97,000 shares\r\n\r\nThe estimated earnings of this company for 1917 are $3,000,000.\r\nIn addition the company has been allowed claims for infringements\r\nsustained by the courts, amounting to $2,000,000.\r\n\r\n(c) The Motor Products Corporation issued 100,000 shares, divided as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Class \xe2\x80\x9cA,\xe2\x80\x9d no par value, non voting ..  95,000 shares\r\n  Class \xe2\x80\x9cB,\xe2\x80\x9d no par value, voting .......  5,000 shares\r\n\r\nThis corporation has taken over five companies manufacturing\r\nmiscellaneous products, such as automobile radiators, windshields, etc.\r\nTheir earnings for 1916 were $788,000.\r\n\r\n(d) A more usual form is the $5,000,000 issue of 7 per cent cumulative\r\npreferred stock and 200,000 shares common stock, of the Fischer Body\r\nCorporation. It is not contemplated to pay a dividend on the common\r\nuntil the company has $1,000,000 surplus earnings. Its net profits for\r\nthe year 1916 were $1,000,000 on a total volume of business amounting\r\nto $20,000,000. The preferred stock is redeemable at $120.\r\n\r\n(e) The United Alloy Steel Corporation issued 525,000 shares without\r\npar value, of which 500,000 were used to acquire United Steel Company,\r\nmanufacturing alloy steel parts for the automobile trade.\r\n\r\nFor expansion purposes to provide more adequate equipment to supply the\r\nincreasing demand for its product, $4,000,000 additional cash capital\r\nwas to be provided. The estimated net earnings for 1916 were about $7 a\r\nshare on 500,000 shares.\r\n\r\n(f) Transue &amp; Williams Steel Forging Company issued 110,000 shares\r\nwithout par value. One hundred thousand shares and $750,000 cash was to\r\nbe paid for company subscriptions at $45.50 a share. The net earnings\r\nfor 7 months of 1916 were $648,026 or $12 a share.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITY ISSUES OF TIRE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\nAmong the tire company stock issues a few leading examples may be cited.\r\n\r\nThe Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company issued $5,000,000 of 6 per cent\r\ncumulative preferred stock. A sinking fund is provided to redeem this\r\nstock at $110, beginning 1921. There are no bonds, and the company is\r\nrequired to maintain at all times total net assets equal to 250 per\r\ncent and net quick assets equal to 150 per cent of the aggregate par\r\nvalue of this stock outstanding.\r\n\r\nThe earnings for 1916 were $4,482,554.52, or over seven times the\r\ndividend requirements on the total issue of preferred stock. This\r\nstock was sold at $107.\r\n\r\nAnother representative issue was that of the Fisk Rubber Company,\r\nwhich consisted of $5,000,000 of cumulative 7 per cent first preferred\r\nconvertible stock. This is redeemable at $110 upon 60 days\xe2\x80\x99 notice.\r\n\r\nThe earnings for the year ending August 31, 1916, were $1,992,043, or\r\nthree times the dividend requirements. There are no bonds or other form\r\nof funded debt.\r\n\r\nOne of the few instances of an issue of bonds by a tire company is the\r\nissue of $60,000,000 of 5 per cent gold bonds by the United States\r\nRubber Company. Of course, tires are only a part of this company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noutput. The proceeds of the sale of these bonds are to be used to\r\nretire certain obligations of subsidiaries, to provide additional\r\nworking capital, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWER ENTRANTS INTO THE SECURITY MARKET.\r\n\r\nWhile in the foregoing chapter are noted some of the securities of\r\nrepresentative manufacturers attracting the most pronounced attention,\r\nthere are several others on the border line, or that have not as yet\r\n\xe2\x80\x9carrived,\xe2\x80\x9d and possibly may never do so.\r\n\r\nThere has, therefore, been so little activity in these securities,\r\nthat examples of their flotations are negligible in this report.\r\n\r\nThose most in the public eye are perhaps:\r\n\r\n  The Harroun Motors Corporation\r\n  The Emerson Motors Company, Inc.\r\n  The Ford Tractor Company, Inc., etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME LEADING EXAMPLES OF APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION IN VALUE OF SUCH\r\nSTOCKS SINCE THEY WERE PUT OUT.\r\n\r\nAn example of depreciation in automobile stocks of an exaggerated\r\ntype was that of the United States Motor Company, a combination of\r\nthe Maxwell-Briscoe, Columbia, Stoddard-Dayton, Brush, and Sampson\r\nCompanies. With an issue of about $35,000,000 stock, New York Curb\r\nprices in 1912 for the common ranged from 9 down to 1/16 and for the\r\npreferred from 30-1/2 down to 3/4.\r\n\r\nThe properties of this company have since been taken over by the\r\nMaxwell Motors Companys, which issued the following securities:\r\n\r\n  $13,000,000   1st preferred\r\n   11,000,000   2nd preferred\r\n   13,000,000   common\r\n\r\nThe prices of these stocks have ranged as follows:\r\n\r\n                              1914           1917\r\n  Common                        3             47-1/2\r\n  1st preferred                22             64\r\n  2nd preferred                 7             32\r\n\r\nThis instance gives an extreme example of the fluctuations possible in\r\nmotor stocks in one year, in 1912 the market values reaching as high as\r\n7,200 per cent of the value indicated at low. The re-organized company\r\nin less than five years showed a market value of possibly 38,000 per\r\ncent of the market value of the old company at its low, and 500 per\r\ncent of its value at its high.\r\n\r\nThese great increases in volume and values are what have made so\r\nmany motor millionaires, and, conversely, have swept away some large\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nAnother instance is the stock of the Studebaker Corporation, which\r\nsold as low as 20 in 1914 and which now brings 102. Also the\r\nKelly-Springfield Tire Company\xe2\x80\x99s stock rose from 50 to 299, due to\r\ntheir great increase in business and consequent large earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMPARISON.\r\n\r\nThe attached chart, showing the average high and low prices of\r\nrepresentative groups of securities during 1916, may be used as a\r\ncomparison of the average selling price of the motor group with that of\r\nrailroads, industrials, and mining.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the greatest fluctuations occur in the mining,\r\nsteel and iron stocks of the standard list, and that a similar\r\nfluctuation occurs in the tire and automobile stocks of the motor group.\r\n\r\nThis comparison would tend to show that the tire and motor stocks are\r\nstill in the class which fluctuates considerably and therefore, except\r\nin special cases, are more or less speculative. In this light these\r\nfigures and comparisons are very interesting and may be carefully\r\nconsidered from the investment standpoint.\r\n\r\n_The following chart compares the average high and low prices of\r\nrepresentative groups of stocks during 1916 with similar groups in the\r\nautomobile field:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT TREND OF VALUES.\r\n\r\nAfter the great rise in prices, the trend of values of the securities\r\nof motor accessory and tire companies, during the first quarter of\r\n1917, was generally downward. During the past two years a large number\r\nof such stocks have been put on the market (see table 1 and 3) and a\r\ngreat deal of speculation has taken place, with the result that the\r\nmarket seems overloaded at the high prices at which the public has\r\nbought these stocks. At the time of the market reaction at the end of\r\n1916, under various influences, motor stocks suffered considerable\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nA few prominent instances may be cited. Studebaker, which sold as high\r\nas 67 in 1916, sold down to 102. Chevrolet Motor, whose high mark in\r\n1916 was 278, sold down to 120. United Motors, which sold at 95 in\r\n1916, sold down to 42-3/4. Similar conditions obtain through most of\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\nAmong tire companies a few instances will show the same general\r\ndownward tendency.\r\n\r\nLee Tire &amp; Rubber Company\xe2\x80\x99s stock, which sold for 50-1/4 in 1915, is\r\nnow selling around 23. Goodrich stock, which brought around 80 in 1915\r\nand 1916, ranges between 51 and 58. The Kelly-Springfield Tire Company,\r\nwhich sold as high as 85-1/4 in 1916, now sells around 60.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1916, the range of high and of low of 25 leading\r\nrailroad stocks traded in on the New York Exchange was between 76 and\r\n85. Twenty-five leading industrials for the same period ranged between\r\n90 and 113. The range of all the motor stocks traded in during this\r\ntime was from 119 to 231; while that of the tire companies was from 45\r\nto 76.\r\n\r\nOn the Curb, motor stocks in 1916 ranged from 39-3/4 to 57-3/4; tire\r\nstocks from 67 to 79; and accessories from 58 to 73, all of these\r\nfigures representing average high and low of each class.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE FUTURE TREND IN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY AS A BASIS FOR THE FUTURE\r\nOUTLOOK FOR 1917 ON ITS SECURITIES.\r\n\r\nAs was stated in the opening introduction, economic conditions are\r\nperhaps the greatest factor to be considered in constructing any\r\nforecast for the operation of such an industry as that of the motor,\r\nmotor accessory and tire group.\r\n\r\nThese economic conditions have mainly to do with:\r\n\r\n (a) The increase of population, its effect reflected in increased\r\n registration, and automobile production.\r\n\r\n (b) The uneven distribution of automobiles in the United States.\r\n\r\n(a) Following is a chart which shows graphically the comparison between\r\nthe growth of population, increased registration, and increased\r\nautomobile production since 1911.\r\n\r\n_The following chart shows the rate of growth of automobile production\r\nand registration compared with increase in population:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\nThis would indicate that, while the population is gaining slowly and\r\nconsistently, the production of automobiles has taken a decided jump,\r\nand a natural inference is that, even with so remarkable an industry\r\nas the motor group, it is beginning to prove food for speculation\r\nas to whether or not manufacturers, at the present increasing ratio\r\nof production and distribution, will bring a more or less complete\r\nsaturation of the public, able to buy and support pleasure automobiles.\r\n\r\nMany conservative judges have figured that this may not come for some\r\nyears, possible five or more. It may be that new conditions will arise\r\nto put that period further ahead, or indefinitely postpone it.\r\n\r\n(b) In this connection, the following chart is of interest. This shows\r\nthe ratio of voting men to each registered automobile in the United\r\nStates by states.\r\n\r\n_The following chart shows the ratio by states of men over 21 to each\r\nregistered automobile:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\nAttention is invited to the diverging range of distribution.\r\nTerritorial and community economics account for this very largely. For\r\nexample, an analysis of three sections will show a decided variation,\r\nsay for New York (with one automobile for 15 voting men); Arkansas\r\n(with one automobile for every 54 voters); and Alabama (with one\r\nautomobile for every 43 voters).\r\n\r\nThe state of New York is very largely industrial, and one might\r\ncommonly infer that, due to the great wealth represented in this state,\r\nthe ratio should be much smaller. States like Arkansas, Kansas and\r\nIowa are distinctively rural sections\xe2\x80\x94where the population is not so\r\nclustered as in cities like New York, and automobile transportation\r\nis more utilitarian than a luxury or pastime. For this reason it is\r\nestimated that practically every voter, almost, in Kansas and Iowa is a\r\npossible prospect in figuring future consumption.\r\n\r\nStill another diversion notably exists in the ratio shown for the\r\nSouthern states, and this is readily explained by reason of a paucity\r\nof buying power, since the majority population is negro.\r\n\r\nTo indicate how the various types of automobiles have been distributed\r\nin three different states, the following chart is included in this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n_The following chart shows the distribution of leading motor cars in\r\ndifferent states:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\nThe following factors may be instrumental in the automobile industry in\r\npreventing the reaching of an absolute saturation point:\r\n\r\n (1) Increase in earning or buying power of those now unable to support\r\n an automobile;\r\n\r\n (2) A very low average price;\r\n\r\n (3) Production finally being held at the point where it keeps pace\r\n with the increase in population;\r\n\r\n (4) Increase in the utilitarian need of the automobile.\r\n\r\nIn making up a quota for the possible consumption in the automobile\r\nindustry, the following chart may be considered as a conservative basis\r\nto work on.\r\n\r\n_The following chart shows the estimated automobile market for 1917:_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart]\r\n\r\nThere being, therefore so many elements entering into the question of\r\ninfluence upon this group of securities, it is rather venturesome to\r\npresume any prediction for their future, for fear such prediction may\r\nprove unfounded, as have many former guesses on their probable rise and\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThe immediate outlook for 1917 is at present somewhat baffling, aside\r\nfrom the economic tendencies, charted in this chapter, but there may\r\nbe a change for improvement at any time in the motor car industry,\r\nespecially if our government should place large orders for cars and\r\nsupplies in the event of war, or the foreign trade should take on large\r\nquantities for the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the supply of parts for cars is now, and\r\nwill be more and more, an extensive business of the motor car industry.\r\n\r\nOne prominent New York newspaper which censors very carefully its\r\nadvertising is very cautious in handling offerings on motor stocks.\r\n\r\nIt might be safe to assume that motor stocks in well managed companies\r\nmaking popular cars will be as secure an investment for reasonable\r\nearnings on products as other industrials for some years to come and\r\npossibly indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe future of automobile accessories is possibly not subject to\r\nfluctuations in the same degree, nor as apt to reach the saturation\r\npoint as might be the development in the automobile industry, for\r\nthe reason that with the increase in the number of cars in use, the\r\npurchase of many accessories will be made by car owners, even though\r\nthe manufacturers should not continue to buy an increasing, or even\r\nequal, volume.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to expect that the earnings on and the price of\r\nautomobile accessory stocks should therefore remain firm, if conditions\r\nof trade or competition do not unduly affect them.\r\n\r\nThe future of the tire industry and stocks seems reasonably secure, as\r\nunless some satisfactory substitutes for rubber tires are discovered,\r\napparently an increasing number of tires for replacements, if not new\r\ncars, should be demanded each year.\r\n\r\nThe present earnings of the tire companies are very large and should\r\ncontinue favorable. It must be remembered that the cost of material and\r\nlabor are as important considerations to this class of manufacturers as\r\nto all industrials, and that their undue rise in cost might affect the\r\nindustry more or less temporarily. But as they have come to be classed\r\nas necessities, the prices would naturally adjust themselves to the\r\ncost of manufacture.\r\n\r\nWith all popular cars sold far in excess of their capacity, barring\r\nthe interference or lack of transportation, labor friction, or\r\nother unexpected or disturbing elements, it is safe to assume that\r\n1917 should be a record year in the motor, motor accessory and tire\r\nindustries, and that their earnings should be reflected in the\r\nintrinsic and probably the market values of their securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPASSENGER AUTOMOBILES MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is, as near as possible, a complete list of the passenger\r\nautomobiles manufactured in the United States, with the number of\r\ncylinders and the retail price of each. New cars are being put on the\r\nmarket so rapidly that it is difficult to keep track of them.\r\n\r\nThe prices quoted may not be exact in every case, as manufacturers are\r\nputting up prices quite generally as this volume goes to press. They\r\nare the prices at which the cars sold for a long time, and they are\r\ngiven without the intention to be exact to the dollar, but merely as\r\nrelative figures of retail cost.\r\n\r\nAn automobile quoted at $1,195 may have undergone a price raise to\r\n$1,350, but the former price quotation fixes the car\xe2\x80\x99s retail price\r\nstatus as compared with a car that sells for $360 or $550.\r\n\r\nOne hundred manufacturers are said to have raised their prices,\r\nand forty made increases from $10 to $700 on each car, the average\r\nadvance being $146. Freight conditions and the uncertainties of the\r\ninternational situation were advanced as reasons for the increase.\r\n\r\nPractically all the American manufacturers of tires also raised prices\r\na second time within a year, the range of the last increase being from\r\n6-1/2 to 12 per cent. Where price is not given, it was not available.\r\n\r\n                                            Cylinders      Price\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAbbott-Detroit\xe2\x80\x9d   Abbott Corporation,\r\n                       Cleveland, O.             6     $1,195 to $1,820\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAllen\xe2\x80\x9d            Allen Motor Car Co.,\r\n                       Fostoria, O.              4        850 to  1,195\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAlter\xe2\x80\x9d            Alter Motor Car Co.,\r\n                       Grand Haven, Mich.      4-6        675 to    850\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican\xe2\x80\x9d         American Motors\r\n                       Corporation, New York,\r\n                       N.
