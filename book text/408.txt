This meaning is not without interest to you, Gentle Reader;\r\nfor the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color\r\nline.\r\n\r\nI pray you, then, receive my little book in all charity, studying my\r\nwords with me, forgiving mistake and foible for sake of the faith and\r\npassion that is in me, and seeking the grain of truth hidden there.\r\n\r\nI have sought here to sketch, in vague, uncertain outline, the\r\nspiritual world in which ten thousand thousand Americans live and\r\nstrive. First, in two chapters I have tried to show what Emancipation\r\nmeant to them, and what was its aftermath. In a third chapter I have\r\npointed out the slow rise of personal leadership, and criticized\r\ncandidly the leader who bears the chief burden of his race to-day.\r\nThen, in two other chapters I have sketched in swift outline the two\r\nworlds within and without the Veil, and thus have come to the central\r\nproblem of training men for life. Venturing now into deeper detail, I\r\nhave in two chapters studied the struggles of the massed millions of\r\nthe black peasantry, and in another have sought to make clear the\r\npresent relations of the sons of master and man. Leaving, then, the\r\nwhite world, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may\r\nview faintly its deeper recesses,\xe2\x80\x94the meaning of its religion, the\r\npassion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls. All\r\nthis I have ended with a tale twice told but seldom written, and a\r\nchapter of song.\r\n\r\nSome of these thoughts of mine have seen the light before in other\r\nguise. For kindly consenting to their republication here, in altered\r\nand extended form, I must thank the publishers of the Atlantic Monthly,\r\nThe World\xe2\x80\x99s Work, the Dial, The New World, and the Annals of the\r\nAmerican Academy of Political and Social Science. Before each chapter,\r\nas now printed, stands a bar of the Sorrow Songs,\xe2\x80\x94some echo of haunting\r\nmelody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in\r\nthe dark past. And, finally, need I add that I who speak here am bone\r\nof the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?\r\n\r\nW.E.B. Du B.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlanta, Ga., Feb. 1, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nOf Our Spiritual Strivings\r\n\r\nO water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand,\r\n    All night long crying with a mournful cry,\r\nAs I lie and listen, and cannot understand\r\n        The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea,\r\n    O water, crying for rest, is it I, is it I?\r\n        All night long the water is crying to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnresting water, there shall never be rest\r\n    Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail,\r\nAnd the fire of the end begin to burn in the west;\r\n        And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea,\r\n    All life long crying without avail,\r\n        As the water all night long is crying to me.\r\n\r\nARTHUR SYMONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween me and the other world there is ever an unasked question:\r\nunasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the\r\ndifficulty of rightly framing it. All, nevertheless, flutter round it.\r\nThey approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or\r\ncompassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, How does it feel\r\nto be a problem? they say, I know an excellent colored man in my town;\r\nor, I fought at Mechanicsville; or, Do not these Southern outrages make\r\nyour blood boil? At these I smile, or am interested, or reduce the\r\nboiling to a simmer, as the occasion may require. To the real question,\r\nHow does it feel to be a problem? I answer seldom a word.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, being a problem is a strange experience,\xe2\x80\x94peculiar even for one\r\nwho has never been anything else, save perhaps in babyhood and in\r\nEurope. It is in the early days of rollicking boyhood that the\r\nrevelation first bursts upon one, all in a day, as it were. I remember\r\nwell when the shadow swept across me. I was a little thing, away up in\r\nthe hills of New England, where the dark Housatonic winds between\r\nHoosac and Taghkanic to the sea. In a wee wooden schoolhouse, something\r\nput it into the boys\xe2\x80\x99 and girls\xe2\x80\x99 heads to buy gorgeous\r\nvisiting-cards\xe2\x80\x94ten cents a package\xe2\x80\x94and exchange. The exchange was\r\nmerry, till one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card,\xe2\x80\x94refused it\r\nperemptorily, with a glance. Then it dawned upon me with a certain\r\nsuddenness that I was different from the others; or like, mayhap, in\r\nheart and life and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast\r\nveil. I had thereafter no desire to tear down that veil, to creep\r\nthrough; I held all beyond it in common contempt, and lived above it in\r\na region of blue sky and great wandering shadows. That sky was bluest\r\nwhen I could beat my mates at examination-time, or beat them at a\r\nfoot-race, or even beat their stringy heads. Alas, with the years all\r\nthis fine contempt began to fade; for the words I longed for, and all\r\ntheir dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine. But they should\r\nnot keep these prizes, I said; some, all, I would wrest from them. Just\r\nhow I would do it I could never decide: by reading law, by healing the\r\nsick, by telling the wonderful tales that swam in my head,\xe2\x80\x94some way.\r\nWith other black boys the strife was not so fiercely sunny: their youth\r\nshrunk into tasteless sycophancy, or into silent hatred of the pale\r\nworld about them and mocking distrust of everything white; or wasted\r\nitself in a bitter cry, Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger\r\nin mine own house? The shades of the prison-house closed round about us\r\nall: walls strait and stubborn to the whitest, but relentlessly narrow,\r\ntall, and unscalable to sons of night who must plod darkly on in\r\nresignation, or beat unavailing palms against the stone, or steadily,\r\nhalf hopelessly, watch the streak of blue above.\r\n\r\nAfter the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and\r\nMongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and\r\ngifted with second-sight in this American world,\xe2\x80\x94a world which yields\r\nhim no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through\r\nthe revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this\r\ndouble-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\xe2\x80\x99s self\r\nthrough the eyes of others, of measuring one\xe2\x80\x99s soul by the tape of a\r\nworld that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his\r\ntwoness,\xe2\x80\x94an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two\r\nunreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose\r\ndogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\r\n\r\nThe history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nlonging to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into\r\na better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older\r\nselves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America has too\r\nmuch to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul\r\nin a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a\r\nmessage for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man\r\nto be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon\r\nby his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the end of his striving: to be a co-worker in the\r\nkingdom of culture, to escape both death and isolation, to husband and\r\nuse his best powers and his latent genius. These powers of body and\r\nmind have in the past been strangely wasted, dispersed, or forgotten.\r\nThe shadow of a mighty Negro past flits through the tale of Ethiopia\r\nthe Shadowy and of Egypt the Sphinx. Through history, the powers of\r\nsingle black men flash here and there like falling stars, and die\r\nsometimes before the world has rightly gauged their brightness. Here in\r\nAmerica, in the few days since Emancipation, the black man\xe2\x80\x99s turning\r\nhither and thither in hesitant and doubtful striving has often made his\r\nvery strength to lose effectiveness, to seem like absence of power,\r\nlike weakness. And yet it is not weakness,\xe2\x80\x94it is the contradiction of\r\ndouble aims. The double-aimed struggle of the black artisan\xe2\x80\x94on the one\r\nhand to escape white contempt for a nation of mere hewers of wood and\r\ndrawers of water, and on the other hand to plough and nail and dig for\r\na poverty-stricken horde\xe2\x80\x94could only result in making him a poor\r\ncraftsman, for he had but half a heart in either cause. By the poverty\r\nand ignorance of his people, the Negro minister or doctor was tempted\r\ntoward quackery and demagogy; and by the criticism of the other world,\r\ntoward ideals that made him ashamed of his lowly tasks. The would-be\r\nblack savant was confronted by the paradox that the knowledge his\r\npeople needed was a twice-told tale to his white neighbors, while the\r\nknowledge which would teach the white world was Greek to his own flesh\r\nand blood. The innate love of harmony and beauty that set the ruder\r\nsouls of his people a-dancing and a-singing raised but confusion and\r\ndoubt in the soul of the black artist; for the beauty revealed to him\r\nwas the soul-beauty of a race which his larger audience despised, and\r\nhe could not articulate the message of another people. This waste of\r\ndouble aims, this seeking to satisfy two unreconciled ideals, has\r\nwrought sad havoc with the courage and faith and deeds of ten thousand\r\nthousand people,\xe2\x80\x94has sent them often wooing false gods and invoking\r\nfalse means of salvation, and at times has even seemed about to make\r\nthem ashamed of themselves.\r\n\r\nAway back in the days of bondage they thought to see in one divine\r\nevent the end of all doubt and disappointment; few men ever worshipped\r\nFreedom with half such unquestioning faith as did the American Negro\r\nfor two centuries. To him, so far as he thought and dreamed, slavery\r\nwas indeed the sum of all villainies, the cause of all sorrow, the root\r\nof all prejudice; Emancipation was the key to a promised land of\r\nsweeter beauty than ever stretched before the eyes of wearied\r\nIsraelites. In song and exhortation swelled one refrain\xe2\x80\x94Liberty; in his\r\ntears and curses the God he implored had Freedom in his right hand. At\r\nlast it came,\xe2\x80\x94suddenly, fearfully, like a dream. With one wild carnival\r\nof blood and passion came the message in his own plaintive cadences:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShout, O children!\r\nShout, you\xe2\x80\x99re free!\r\nFor God has bought your liberty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nYears have passed away since then,\xe2\x80\x94ten, twenty, forty; forty years of\r\nnational life, forty years of renewal and development, and yet the\r\nswarthy spectre sits in its accustomed seat at the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s feast. In\r\nvain do we cry to this our vastest social problem:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\r\nShall never tremble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nation has not yet found peace from its sins; the freedman has not\r\nyet found in freedom his promised land. Whatever of good may have come\r\nin these years of change, the shadow of a deep disappointment rests\r\nupon the Negro people,\xe2\x80\x94a disappointment all the more bitter because the\r\nunattained ideal was unbounded save by the simple ignorance of a lowly\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe first decade was merely a prolongation of the vain search for\r\nfreedom, the boon that seemed ever barely to elude their grasp,\xe2\x80\x94like a\r\ntantalizing will-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-wisp, maddening and misleading the headless\r\nhost. The holocaust of war, the terrors of the Ku-Klux Klan, the lies\r\nof carpet-baggers, the disorganization of industry, and the\r\ncontradictory advice of friends and foes, left the bewildered serf with\r\nno new watchword beyond the old cry for freedom. As the time flew,\r\nhowever, he began to grasp a new idea. The ideal of liberty demanded\r\nfor its attainment powerful means, and these the Fifteenth Amendment\r\ngave him. The ballot, which before he had looked upon as a visible sign\r\nof freedom, he now regarded as the chief means of gaining and\r\nperfecting the liberty with which war had partially endowed him. And\r\nwhy not? Had not votes made war and emancipated millions? Had not votes\r\nenfranchised the freedmen? Was anything impossible to a power that had\r\ndone all this? A million black men started with renewed zeal to vote\r\nthemselves into the kingdom. So the decade flew away, the revolution of\r\n1876 came, and left the half-free serf weary, wondering, but still\r\ninspired. Slowly but steadily, in the following years, a new vision\r\nbegan gradually to replace the dream of political power,\xe2\x80\x94a powerful\r\nmovement, the rise of another ideal to guide the unguided, another\r\npillar of fire by night after a clouded day. It was the ideal of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbook-learning\xe2\x80\x9d; the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to know\r\nand test the power of the cabalistic letters of the white man, the\r\nlonging to know. Here at last seemed to have been discovered the\r\nmountain path to Canaan; longer than the highway of Emancipation and\r\nlaw, steep and rugged, but straight, leading to heights high enough to\r\noverlook life.\r\n\r\nUp the new path the advance guard toiled, slowly, heavily, doggedly;\r\nonly those who have watched and guided the faltering feet, the misty\r\nminds, the dull understandings, of the dark pupils of these schools\r\nknow how faithfully, how piteously, this people strove to learn. It was\r\nweary work. The cold statistician wrote down the inches of progress\r\nhere and there, noted also where here and there a foot had slipped or\r\nsome one had fallen. To the tired climbers, the horizon was ever dark,\r\nthe mists were often cold, the Canaan was always dim and far away. If,\r\nhowever, the vistas disclosed as yet no goal, no resting-place, little\r\nbut flattery and criticism, the journey at least gave leisure for\r\nreflection and self-examination; it changed the child of Emancipation\r\nto the youth with dawning self-consciousness, self-realization,\r\nself-respect. In those sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose\r\nbefore him, and he saw himself,\xe2\x80\x94darkly as through a veil; and yet he\r\nsaw in himself some faint revelation of his power, of his mission. He\r\nbegan to have a dim feeling that, to attain his place in the world, he\r\nmust be himself, and not another. For the first time he sought to\r\nanalyze the burden he bore upon his back, that dead-weight of social\r\ndegradation partially masked behind a half-named Negro problem. He felt\r\nhis poverty; without a cent, without a home, without land, tools, or\r\nsavings, he had entered into competition with rich, landed, skilled\r\nneighbors. To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of\r\ndollars is the very bottom of hardships. He felt the weight of his\r\nignorance,\xe2\x80\x94not simply of letters, but of life, of business, of the\r\nhumanities; the accumulated sloth and shirking and awkwardness of\r\ndecades and centuries shackled his hands and feet. Nor was his burden\r\nall poverty and ignorance. The red stain of bastardy, which two\r\ncenturies of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had stamped\r\nupon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African chastity, but\r\nalso the hereditary weight of a mass of corruption from white\r\nadulterers, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home.\r\n\r\nA people thus handicapped ought not to be asked to race with the world,\r\nbut rather allowed to give all its time and thought to its own social\r\nproblems. But alas! while sociologists gleefully count his bastards and\r\nhis prostitutes, the very soul of the toiling, sweating black man is\r\ndarkened by the shadow of a vast despair. Men call the shadow\r\nprejudice, and learnedly explain it as the natural defence of culture\r\nagainst barbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime,\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9chigher\xe2\x80\x9d against the \xe2\x80\x9clower\xe2\x80\x9d races. To which the Negro cries Amen!\r\nand swears that to so much of this strange prejudice as is founded on\r\njust homage to civilization, culture, righteousness, and progress, he\r\nhumbly bows and meekly does obeisance. But before that nameless\r\nprejudice that leaps beyond all this he stands helpless, dismayed, and\r\nwell-nigh speechless; before that personal disrespect and mockery, the\r\nridicule and systematic humiliation, the distortion of fact and wanton\r\nlicense of fancy, the cynical ignoring of the better and the boisterous\r\nwelcoming of the worse, the all-pervading desire to inculcate disdain\r\nfor everything black, from Toussaint to the devil,\xe2\x80\x94before this there\r\nrises a sickening despair that would disarm and discourage any nation\r\nsave that black host to whom \xe2\x80\x9cdiscouragement\xe2\x80\x9d is an unwritten word.\r\n\r\nBut the facing of so vast a prejudice could not but bring the\r\ninevitable self-questioning, self-disparagement, and lowering of ideals\r\nwhich ever accompany repression and breed in an atmosphere of contempt\r\nand hate. Whisperings and portents came home upon the four winds: Lo!\r\nwe are diseased and dying, cried the dark hosts; we cannot write, our\r\nvoting is vain; what need of education, since we must always cook and\r\nserve? And the Nation echoed and enforced this self-criticism, saying:\r\nBe content to be servants, and nothing more; what need of higher\r\nculture for half-men? Away with the black man\xe2\x80\x99s ballot, by force or\r\nfraud,\xe2\x80\x94and behold the suicide of a race! Nevertheless, out of the evil\r\ncame something of good,\xe2\x80\x94the more careful adjustment of education to\r\nreal life, the clearer perception of the Negroes\xe2\x80\x99 social\r\nresponsibilities, and the sobering realization of the meaning of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nSo dawned the time of _Sturm und Drang:_ storm and stress to-day rocks\r\nour little boat on the mad waters of the world-sea; there is within and\r\nwithout the sound of conflict, the burning of body and rending of soul;\r\ninspiration strives with doubt, and faith with vain questionings. The\r\nbright ideals of the past,\xe2\x80\x94physical freedom, political power, the\r\ntraining of brains and the training of hands,\xe2\x80\x94all these in turn have\r\nwaxed and waned, until even the last grows dim and overcast. Are they\r\nall wrong,\xe2\x80\x94all false? No, not that, but each alone was over-simple and\r\nincomplete,\xe2\x80\x94the dreams of a credulous race-childhood, or the fond\r\nimaginings of the other world which does not know and does not want to\r\nknow our power. To be really true, all these ideals must be melted and\r\nwelded into one. The training of the schools we need to-day more than\r\never,\xe2\x80\x94the training of deft hands, quick eyes and ears, and above all\r\nthe broader, deeper, higher culture of gifted minds and pure hearts.\r\nThe power of the ballot we need in sheer self-defence,\xe2\x80\x94else what shall\r\nsave us from a second slavery? Freedom, too, the long-sought, we still\r\nseek,\xe2\x80\x94the freedom of life and limb, the freedom to work and think, the\r\nfreedom to love and aspire. Work, culture, liberty,\xe2\x80\x94all these we need,\r\nnot singly but together, not successively but together, each growing\r\nand aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims\r\nbefore the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through\r\nthe unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the\r\ntraits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for\r\nother races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of\r\nthe American Republic, in order that some day on American soil two\r\nworld-races may give each to each those characteristics both so sadly\r\nlack. We the darker ones come even now not altogether empty-handed:\r\nthere are to-day no truer exponents of the pure human spirit of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence than the American Negroes; there is no true\r\nAmerican music but the wild sweet melodies of the Negro slave; the\r\nAmerican fairy tales and folklore are Indian and African; and, all in\r\nall, we black men seem the sole oasis of simple faith and reverence in\r\na dusty desert of dollars and smartness. Will America be poorer if she\r\nreplace her brutal dyspeptic blundering with light-hearted but\r\ndetermined Negro humility? or her coarse and cruel wit with loving\r\njovial good-humor? or her vulgar music with the soul of the Sorrow\r\nSongs?\r\n\r\nMerely a concrete test of the underlying principles of the great\r\nrepublic is the Negro Problem, and the spiritual striving of the\r\nfreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s sons is the travail of souls whose burden is almost beyond\r\nthe measure of their strength, but who bear it in the name of an\r\nhistoric race, in the name of this the land of their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fathers,\r\nand in the name of human opportunity.\r\n\r\nAnd now what I have briefly sketched in large outline let me on coming\r\npages tell again in many ways, with loving emphasis and deeper detail,\r\nthat men may listen to the striving in the souls of black folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nOf the Dawn of Freedom\r\n\r\nCareless seems the great Avenger;\r\n    History\xe2\x80\x99s lessons but record\r\nOne death-grapple in the darkness\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Twixt old systems and the Word;\r\nTruth forever on the scaffold,\r\n    Wrong forever on the throne;\r\nYet that scaffold sways the future,\r\n    And behind the dim unknown\r\nStandeth God within the shadow\r\n    Keeping watch above His own.\r\n\r\nLOWELL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the\r\ncolor-line,\xe2\x80\x94the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in\r\nAsia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea. It was a phase\r\nof this problem that caused the Civil War; and however much they who\r\nmarched South and North in 1861 may have fixed on the technical points,\r\nof union and local autonomy as a shibboleth, all nevertheless knew, as\r\nwe know, that the question of Negro slavery was the real cause of the\r\nconflict. Curious it was, too, how this deeper question ever forced\r\nitself to the surface despite effort and disclaimer. No sooner had\r\nNorthern armies touched Southern soil than this old question, newly\r\nguised, sprang from the earth,\xe2\x80\x94What shall be done with Negroes?\r\nPeremptory military commands this way and that, could not answer the\r\nquery; the Emancipation Proclamation seemed but to broaden and\r\nintensify the difficulties; and the War Amendments made the Negro\r\nproblems of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of this essay to study the period of history from 1861 to\r\n1872 so far as it relates to the American Negro. In effect, this tale\r\nof the dawn of Freedom is an account of that government of men called\r\nthe Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau,\xe2\x80\x94one of the most singular and interesting of the\r\nattempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race\r\nand social condition.\r\n\r\nThe war has naught to do with slaves, cried Congress, the President,\r\nand the Nation; and yet no sooner had the armies, East and West,\r\npenetrated Virginia and Tennessee than fugitive slaves appeared within\r\ntheir lines. They came at night, when the flickering camp-fires shone\r\nlike vast unsteady stars along the black horizon: old men and thin,\r\nwith gray and tufted hair; women with frightened eyes, dragging\r\nwhimpering hungry children; men and girls, stalwart and gaunt,\xe2\x80\x94a horde\r\nof starving vagabonds, homeless, helpless, and pitiable, in their dark\r\ndistress. Two methods of treating these newcomers seemed equally\r\nlogical to opposite sorts of minds. Ben Butler, in Virginia, quickly\r\ndeclared slave property contraband of war, and put the fugitives to\r\nwork; while Fremont, in Missouri, declared the slaves free under\r\nmartial law. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s action was approved, but Fremont\xe2\x80\x99s was hastily\r\ncountermanded, and his successor, Halleck, saw things differently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded, \xe2\x80\x9cno slaves should be allowed to come into\r\nyour lines at all; if any come without your knowledge, when owners call\r\nfor them deliver them.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a policy was difficult to enforce; some of\r\nthe black refugees declared themselves freemen, others showed that\r\ntheir masters had deserted them, and still others were captured with\r\nforts and plantations. Evidently, too, slaves were a source of strength\r\nto the Confederacy, and were being used as laborers and producers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey constitute a military resource,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Secretary Cameron, late in\r\n1861; \xe2\x80\x9cand being such, that they should not be turned over to the enemy\r\nis too plain to discuss.\xe2\x80\x9d So gradually the tone of the army chiefs\r\nchanged; Congress forbade the rendition of fugitives, and Butler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontrabands\xe2\x80\x9d were welcomed as military laborers. This complicated\r\nrather than solved the problem, for now the scattering fugitives became\r\na steady stream, which flowed faster as the armies marched.\r\n\r\nThen the long-headed man with care-chiselled face who sat in the White\r\nHouse saw the inevitable, and emancipated the slaves of rebels on New\r\nYear\xe2\x80\x99s, 1863. A month later Congress called earnestly for the Negro\r\nsoldiers whom the act of July, 1862, had half grudgingly allowed to\r\nenlist. Thus the barriers were levelled and the deed was done. The\r\nstream of fugitives swelled to a flood, and anxious army officers kept\r\ninquiring: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must be done with slaves, arriving almost daily? Are\r\nwe to find food and shelter for women and children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a Pierce of Boston who pointed out the way, and thus became in a\r\nsense the founder of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau. He was a firm friend of\r\nSecretary Chase; and when, in 1861, the care of slaves and abandoned\r\nlands devolved upon the Treasury officials, Pierce was specially\r\ndetailed from the ranks to study the conditions. First, he cared for\r\nthe refugees at Fortress Monroe; and then, after Sherman had captured\r\nHilton Head, Pierce was sent there to found his Port Royal experiment\r\nof making free workingmen out of slaves. Before his experiment was\r\nbarely started, however, the problem of the fugitives had assumed such\r\nproportions that it was taken from the hands of the over-burdened\r\nTreasury Department and given to the army officials. Already centres of\r\nmassed freedmen were forming at Fortress Monroe, Washington, New\r\nOrleans, Vicksburg and Corinth, Columbus, Ky., and Cairo, Ill., as well\r\nas at Port Royal. Army chaplains found here new and fruitful fields;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuperintendents of contrabands\xe2\x80\x9d multiplied, and some attempt at\r\nsystematic work was made by enlisting the able-bodied men and giving\r\nwork to the others.\r\n\r\nThen came the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Aid societies, born of the touching appeals\r\nfrom Pierce and from these other centres of distress. There was the\r\nAmerican Missionary Association, sprung from the Amistad, and now\r\nfull-grown for work; the various church organizations, the National\r\nFreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Relief Association, the American Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Union, the\r\nWestern Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Aid Commission,\xe2\x80\x94in all fifty or more active\r\norganizations, which sent clothes, money, school-books, and teachers\r\nsouthward. All they did was needed, for the destitution of the freedmen\r\nwas often reported as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo appalling for belief,\xe2\x80\x9d and the situation was\r\ndaily growing worse rather than better.\r\n\r\nAnd daily, too, it seemed more plain that this was no ordinary matter\r\nof temporary relief, but a national crisis; for here loomed a labor\r\nproblem of vast dimensions. Masses of Negroes stood idle, or, if they\r\nworked spasmodically, were never sure of pay; and if perchance they\r\nreceived pay, squandered the new thing thoughtlessly. In these and\r\nother ways were camp-life and the new liberty demoralizing the\r\nfreedmen. The broader economic organization thus clearly demanded\r\nsprang up here and there as accident and local conditions determined.\r\nHere it was that Pierce\xe2\x80\x99s Port Royal plan of leased plantations and\r\nguided workmen pointed out the rough way. In Washington the military\r\ngovernor, at the urgent appeal of the superintendent, opened\r\nconfiscated estates to the cultivation of the fugitives, and there in\r\nthe shadow of the dome gathered black farm villages. General Dix gave\r\nover estates to the freedmen of Fortress Monroe, and so on, South and\r\nWest. The government and benevolent societies furnished the means of\r\ncultivation, and the Negro turned again slowly to work. The systems of\r\ncontrol, thus started, rapidly grew, here and there, into strange\r\nlittle governments, like that of General Banks in Louisiana, with its\r\nninety thousand black subjects, its fifty thousand guided laborers, and\r\nits annual budget of one hundred thousand dollars and more. It made out\r\nfour thousand pay-rolls a year, registered all freedmen, inquired into\r\ngrievances and redressed them, laid and collected taxes, and\r\nestablished a system of public schools. So, too, Colonel Eaton, the\r\nsuperintendent of Tennessee and Arkansas, ruled over one hundred\r\nthousand freedmen, leased and cultivated seven thousand acres of cotton\r\nland, and fed ten thousand paupers a year. In South Carolina was\r\nGeneral Saxton, with his deep interest in black folk. He succeeded\r\nPierce and the Treasury officials, and sold forfeited estates, leased\r\nabandoned plantations, encouraged schools, and received from Sherman,\r\nafter that terribly picturesque march to the sea, thousands of the\r\nwretched camp followers.\r\n\r\nThree characteristic things one might have seen in Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s raid\r\nthrough Georgia, which threw the new situation in shadowy relief: the\r\nConqueror, the Conquered, and the Negro. Some see all significance in\r\nthe grim front of the destroyer, and some in the bitter sufferers of\r\nthe Lost Cause. But to me neither soldier nor fugitive speaks with so\r\ndeep a meaning as that dark human cloud that clung like remorse on the\r\nrear of those swift columns, swelling at times to half their size,\r\nalmost engulfing and choking them. In vain were they ordered back, in\r\nvain were bridges hewn from beneath their feet; on they trudged and\r\nwrithed and surged, until they rolled into Savannah, a starved and\r\nnaked horde of tens of thousands. There too came the characteristic\r\nmilitary remedy: \xe2\x80\x9cThe islands from Charleston south, the abandoned\r\nrice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and\r\nthe country bordering the St. John\xe2\x80\x99s River, Florida, are reserved and\r\nset apart for the settlement of Negroes now made free by act of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo read the celebrated \xe2\x80\x9cField-order Number Fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these experiments, orders, and systems were bound to attract and\r\nperplex the government and the nation. Directly after the Emancipation\r\nProclamation, Representative Eliot had introduced a bill creating a\r\nBureau of Emancipation; but it was never reported. The following June a\r\ncommittee of inquiry, appointed by the Secretary of War, reported in\r\nfavor of a temporary bureau for the \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement, protection, and\r\nemployment of refugee freedmen,\xe2\x80\x9d on much the same lines as were\r\nafterwards followed. Petitions came in to President Lincoln from\r\ndistinguished citizens and organizations, strongly urging a\r\ncomprehensive and unified plan of dealing with the freedmen, under a\r\nbureau which should be \xe2\x80\x9ccharged with the study of plans and execution\r\nof measures for easily guiding, and in every way judiciously and\r\nhumanely aiding, the passage of our emancipated and yet to be\r\nemancipated blacks from the old condition of forced labor to their new\r\nstate of voluntary industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome half-hearted steps were taken to accomplish this, in part, by\r\nputting the whole matter again in charge of the special Treasury\r\nagents. Laws of 1863 and 1864 directed them to take charge of and lease\r\nabandoned lands for periods not exceeding twelve months, and to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprovide in such leases, or otherwise, for the employment and general\r\nwelfare\xe2\x80\x9d of the freedmen. Most of the army officers greeted this as a\r\nwelcome relief from perplexing \xe2\x80\x9cNegro affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d and Secretary\r\nFessenden, July 29, 1864, issued an excellent system of regulations,\r\nwhich were afterward closely followed by General Howard. Under Treasury\r\nagents, large quantities of land were leased in the Mississippi Valley,\r\nand many Negroes were employed; but in August, 1864, the new\r\nregulations were suspended for reasons of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic policy,\xe2\x80\x9d and the army\r\nwas again in control.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Congress had turned its attention to the subject; and in\r\nMarch the House passed a bill by a majority of two establishing a\r\nBureau for Freedmen in the War Department. Charles Sumner, who had\r\ncharge of the bill in the Senate, argued that freedmen and abandoned\r\nlands ought to be under the same department, and reported a substitute\r\nfor the House bill attaching the Bureau to the Treasury Department.\r\nThis bill passed, but too late for action by the House. The debates\r\nwandered over the whole policy of the administration and the general\r\nquestion of slavery, without touching very closely the specific merits\r\nof the measure in hand. Then the national election took place; and the\r\nadministration, with a vote of renewed confidence from the country,\r\naddressed itself to the matter more seriously. A conference between the\r\ntwo branches of Congress agreed upon a carefully drawn measure which\r\ncontained the chief provisions of Sumner\xe2\x80\x99s bill, but made the proposed\r\norganization a department independent of both the War and the Treasury\r\nofficials. The bill was conservative, giving the new department\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgeneral superintendence of all freedmen.\xe2\x80\x9d Its purpose was to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cestablish regulations\xe2\x80\x9d for them, protect them, lease them lands,\r\nadjust their wages, and appear in civil and military courts as their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnext friend.\xe2\x80\x9d There were many limitations attached to the powers thus\r\ngranted, and the organization was made permanent. Nevertheless, the\r\nSenate defeated the bill, and a new conference committee was appointed.\r\nThis committee reported a new bill, February 28, which was whirled\r\nthrough just as the session closed, and became the act of 1865\r\nestablishing in the War Department a \xe2\x80\x9cBureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and\r\nAbandoned Lands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last compromise was a hasty bit of legislation, vague and\r\nuncertain in outline. A Bureau was created, \xe2\x80\x9cto continue during the\r\npresent War of Rebellion, and for one year thereafter,\xe2\x80\x9d to which was\r\ngiven \xe2\x80\x9cthe supervision and management of all abandoned lands and the\r\ncontrol of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen,\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9csuch\r\nrules and regulations as may be presented by the head of the Bureau and\r\napproved by the President.\xe2\x80\x9d A Commissioner, appointed by the President\r\nand Senate, was to control the Bureau, with an office force not\r\nexceeding ten clerks. The President might also appoint assistant\r\ncommissioners in the seceded States, and to all these offices military\r\nofficials might be detailed at regular pay. The Secretary of War could\r\nissue rations, clothing, and fuel to the destitute, and all abandoned\r\nproperty was placed in the hands of the Bureau for eventual lease and\r\nsale to ex-slaves in forty-acre parcels.\r\n\r\nThus did the United States government definitely assume charge of the\r\nemancipated Negro as the ward of the nation. It was a tremendous\r\nundertaking. Here at a stroke of the pen was erected a government of\r\nmillions of men,\xe2\x80\x94and not ordinary men either, but black men emasculated\r\nby a peculiarly complete system of slavery, centuries old; and now,\r\nsuddenly, violently, they come into a new birthright, at a time of war\r\nand passion, in the midst of the stricken and embittered population of\r\ntheir former masters. Any man might well have hesitated to assume\r\ncharge of such a work, with vast responsibilities, indefinite powers,\r\nand limited resources. Probably no one but a soldier would have\r\nanswered such a call promptly; and, indeed, no one but a soldier could\r\nbe called, for Congress had appropriated no money for salaries and\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nLess than a month after the weary Emancipator passed to his rest, his\r\nsuccessor assigned Major-Gen. Oliver O. Howard to duty as Commissioner\r\nof the new Bureau. He was a Maine man, then only thirty-five years of\r\nage. He had marched with Sherman to the sea, had fought well at\r\nGettysburg, and but the year before had been assigned to the command of\r\nthe Department of Tennessee. An honest man, with too much faith in\r\nhuman nature, little aptitude for business and intricate detail, he had\r\nhad large opportunity of becoming acquainted at first hand with much of\r\nthe work before him. And of that work it has been truly said that \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\napproximately correct history of civilization can ever be written which\r\ndoes not throw out in bold relief, as one of the great landmarks of\r\npolitical and social progress, the organization and administration of\r\nthe Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1865, Howard was appointed; and he assumed the duties of his\r\noffice promptly on the 15th, and began examining the field of work. A\r\ncurious mess he looked upon: little despotisms, communistic\r\nexperiments, slavery, peonage, business speculations, organized\r\ncharity, unorganized almsgiving,\xe2\x80\x94all reeling on under the guise of\r\nhelping the freedmen, and all enshrined in the smoke and blood of the\r\nwar and the cursing and silence of angry men. On May 19 the new\r\ngovernment\xe2\x80\x94for a government it really was\xe2\x80\x94issued its constitution;\r\ncommissioners were to be appointed in each of the seceded states, who\r\nwere to take charge of \xe2\x80\x9call subjects relating to refugees and\r\nfreedmen,\xe2\x80\x9d and all relief and rations were to be given by their consent\r\nalone. The Bureau invited continued cooperation with benevolent\r\nsocieties, and declared: \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the object of all commissioners to\r\nintroduce practicable systems of compensated labor,\xe2\x80\x9d and to establish\r\nschools. Forthwith nine assistant commissioners were appointed. They\r\nwere to hasten to their fields of work; seek gradually to close relief\r\nestablishments, and make the destitute self-supporting; act as courts\r\nof law where there were no courts, or where Negroes were not recognized\r\nin them as free; establish the institution of marriage among ex-slaves,\r\nand keep records; see that freedmen were free to choose their\r\nemployers, and help in making fair contracts for them; and finally, the\r\ncircular said: \xe2\x80\x9cSimple good faith, for which we hope on all hands for\r\nthose concerned in the passing away of slavery, will especially relieve\r\nthe assistant commissioners in the discharge of their duties toward the\r\nfreedmen, as well as promote the general welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the work thus started, and the general system and local\r\norganization in some measure begun, than two grave difficulties\r\nappeared which changed largely the theory and outcome of Bureau work.\r\nFirst, there were the abandoned lands of the South. It had long been\r\nthe more or less definitely expressed theory of the North that all the\r\nchief problems of Emancipation might be settled by establishing the\r\nslaves on the forfeited lands of their masters,\xe2\x80\x94a sort of poetic\r\njustice, said some. But this poetry done into solemn prose meant either\r\nwholesale confiscation of private property in the South, or vast\r\nappropriations. Now Congress had not appropriated a cent, and no sooner\r\ndid the proclamations of general amnesty appear than the eight hundred\r\nthousand acres of abandoned lands in the hands of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau\r\nmelted quickly away. The second difficulty lay in perfecting the local\r\norganization of the Bureau throughout the wide field of work. Making a\r\nnew machine and sending out officials of duly ascertained fitness for a\r\ngreat work of social reform is no child\xe2\x80\x99s task; but this task was even\r\nharder, for a new central organization had to be fitted on a\r\nheterogeneous and confused but already existing system of relief and\r\ncontrol of ex-slaves; and the agents available for this work must be\r\nsought for in an army still busy with war operations,\xe2\x80\x94men in the very\r\nnature of the case ill fitted for delicate social work,\xe2\x80\x94or among the\r\nquestionable camp followers of an invading host. Thus, after a year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, vigorously as it was pushed, the problem looked even more\r\ndifficult to grasp and solve than at the beginning. Nevertheless, three\r\nthings that year\xe2\x80\x99s work did, well worth the doing: it relieved a vast\r\namount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives\r\nfrom congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it\r\ninaugurated the crusade of the New England schoolma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n\r\nThe annals of this Ninth Crusade are yet to be written,\xe2\x80\x94the tale of a\r\nmission that seemed to our age far more quixotic than the quest of St.\r\nLouis seemed to his. Behind the mists of ruin and rapine waved the\r\ncalico dresses of women who dared, and after the hoarse mouthings of\r\nthe field guns rang the rhythm of the alphabet. Rich and poor they\r\nwere, serious and curious. Bereaved now of a father, now of a brother,\r\nnow of more than these, they came seeking a life work in planting New\r\nEngland schoolhouses among the white and black of the South. They did\r\ntheir work well. In that first year they taught one hundred thousand\r\nsouls, and more.\r\n\r\nEvidently, Congress must soon legislate again on the hastily organized\r\nBureau, which had so quickly grown into wide significance and vast\r\npossibilities. An institution such as that was well-nigh as difficult\r\nto end as to begin. Early in 1866 Congress took up the matter, when\r\nSenator Trumbull, of Illinois, introduced a bill to extend the Bureau\r\nand enlarge its powers. This measure received, at the hands of\r\nCongress, far more thorough discussion and attention than its\r\npredecessor. The war cloud had thinned enough to allow a clearer\r\nconception of the work of Emancipation. The champions of the bill\r\nargued that the strengthening of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau was still a\r\nmilitary necessity; that it was needed for the proper carrying out of\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment, and was a work of sheer justice to the\r\nex-slave, at a trifling cost to the government. The opponents of the\r\nmeasure declared that the war was over, and the necessity for war\r\nmeasures past; that the Bureau, by reason of its extraordinary powers,\r\nwas clearly unconstitutional in time of peace, and was destined to\r\nirritate the South and pauperize the freedmen, at a final cost of\r\npossibly hundreds of millions. These two arguments were unanswered, and\r\nindeed unanswerable: the one that the extraordinary powers of the\r\nBureau threatened the civil rights of all citizens; and the other that\r\nthe government must have power to do what manifestly must be done, and\r\nthat present abandonment of the freedmen meant their practical\r\nreenslavement. The bill which finally passed enlarged and made\r\npermanent the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau. It was promptly vetoed by President\r\nJohnson as \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextrajudicial,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfailed of passage over the veto. Meantime, however, the breach between\r\nCongress and the President began to broaden, and a modified form of the\r\nlost bill was finally passed over the President\xe2\x80\x99s second veto, July 16.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1866 gave the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau its final form,\xe2\x80\x94the form by\r\nwhich it will be known to posterity and judged of men. It extended the\r\nexistence of the Bureau to July, 1868; it authorized additional\r\nassistant commissioners, the retention of army officers mustered out of\r\nregular service, the sale of certain forfeited lands to freedmen on\r\nnominal terms, the sale of Confederate public property for Negro\r\nschools, and a wider field of judicial interpretation and cognizance.\r\nThe government of the unreconstructed South was thus put very largely\r\nin the hands of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, especially as in many cases the\r\ndepartmental military commander was now made also assistant\r\ncommissioner. It was thus that the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau became a\r\nfull-fledged government of men. It made laws, executed them and\r\ninterpreted them; it laid and collected taxes, defined and punished\r\ncrime, maintained and used military force, and dictated such measures\r\nas it thought necessary and proper for the accomplishment of its varied\r\nends. Naturally, all these powers were not exercised continuously nor\r\nto their fullest extent; and yet, as General Howard has said, \xe2\x80\x9cscarcely\r\nany subject that has to be legislated upon in civil society failed, at\r\none time or another, to demand the action of this singular Bureau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo understand and criticise intelligently so vast a work, one must not\r\nforget an instant the drift of things in the later sixties. Lee had\r\nsurrendered, Lincoln was dead, and Johnson and Congress were at\r\nloggerheads; the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted, the Fourteenth\r\npending, and the Fifteenth declared in force in 1870. Guerrilla\r\nraiding, the ever-present flickering after-flame of war, was spending\r\nits forces against the Negroes, and all the Southern land was awakening\r\nas from some wild dream to poverty and social revolution. In a time of\r\nperfect calm, amid willing neighbors and streaming wealth, the social\r\nuplifting of four million slaves to an assured and self-sustaining\r\nplace in the body politic and economic would have been a herculean\r\ntask; but when to the inherent difficulties of so delicate and nice a\r\nsocial operation were added the spite and hate of conflict, the hell of\r\nwar; when suspicion and cruelty were rife, and gaunt Hunger wept beside\r\nBereavement,\xe2\x80\x94in such a case, the work of any instrument of social\r\nregeneration was in large part foredoomed to failure. The very name of\r\nthe Bureau stood for a thing in the South which for two centuries and\r\nbetter men had refused even to argue,\xe2\x80\x94that life amid free Negroes was\r\nsimply unthinkable, the maddest of experiments.\r\n\r\nThe agents that the Bureau could command varied all the way from\r\nunselfish philanthropists to narrow-minded busybodies and thieves; and\r\neven though it be true that the average was far better than the worst,\r\nit was the occasional fly that helped spoil the ointment.\r\n\r\nThen amid all crouched the freed slave, bewildered between friend and\r\nfoe. He had emerged from slavery,\xe2\x80\x94not the worst slavery in the world,\r\nnot a slavery that made all life unbearable, rather a slavery that had\r\nhere and there something of kindliness, fidelity, and happiness,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwithal slavery, which, so far as human aspiration and desert were\r\nconcerned, classed the black man and the ox together. And the Negro\r\nknew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may have been,\r\nSouthern men had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate this\r\nslavery under which the black masses, with half-articulate thought, had\r\nwrithed and shivered. They welcomed freedom with a cry. They shrank\r\nfrom the master who still strove for their chains; they fled to the\r\nfriends that had freed them, even though those friends stood ready to\r\nuse them as a club for driving the recalcitrant South back into\r\nloyalty. So the cleft between the white and black South grew. Idle to\r\nsay it never should have been; it was as inevitable as its results were\r\npitiable. Curiously incongruous elements were left arrayed against each\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x94the North, the government, the carpet-bagger, and the slave,\r\nhere; and there, all the South that was white, whether gentleman or\r\nvagabond, honest man or rascal, lawless murderer or martyr to duty.\r\n\r\nThus it is doubly difficult to write of this period calmly, so intense\r\nwas the feeling, so mighty the human passions that swayed and blinded\r\nmen. Amid it all, two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming\r\nages,\xe2\x80\x94the one, a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers had quit\r\nthemselves like men, whose sons lay in nameless graves; who bowed to\r\nthe evil of slavery because its abolition threatened untold ill to all;\r\nwho stood at last, in the evening of life, a blighted, ruined form,\r\nwith hate in his eyes;\xe2\x80\x94and the other, a form hovering dark and\r\nmother-like, her awful face black with the mists of centuries, had\r\naforetime quailed at that white master\xe2\x80\x99s command, had bent in love over\r\nthe cradles of his sons and daughters, and closed in death the sunken\r\neyes of his wife,\xe2\x80\x94aye, too, at his behest had laid herself low to his\r\nlust, and borne a tawny man-child to the world, only to see her dark\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s limbs scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdamned Niggers.\xe2\x80\x9d These were the saddest sights of that woful day; and\r\nno man clasped the hands of these two passing figures of the\r\npresent-past; but, hating, they went to their long home, and, hating,\r\ntheir children\xe2\x80\x99s children live today.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the field of work for the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau; and since,\r\nwith some hesitation, it was continued by the act of 1868 until 1869,\r\nlet us look upon four years of its work as a whole. There were, in\r\n1868, nine hundred Bureau officials scattered from Washington to Texas,\r\nruling, directly and indirectly, many millions of men. The deeds of\r\nthese rulers fall mainly under seven heads: the relief of physical\r\nsuffering, the overseeing of the beginnings of free labor, the buying\r\nand selling of land, the establishment of schools, the paying of\r\nbounties, the administration of justice, and the financiering of all\r\nthese activities.\r\n\r\nUp to June, 1869, over half a million patients had been treated by\r\nBureau physicians and surgeons, and sixty hospitals and asylums had\r\nbeen in operation. In fifty months twenty-one million free rations were\r\ndistributed at a cost of over four million dollars. Next came the\r\ndifficult question of labor. First, thirty thousand black men were\r\ntransported from the refuges and relief stations back to the farms,\r\nback to the critical trial of a new way of working. Plain instructions\r\nwent out from Washington: the laborers must be free to choose their\r\nemployers, no fixed rate of wages was prescribed, and there was to be\r\nno peonage or forced labor. So far, so good; but where local agents\r\ndiffered _toto c\xc3\xa6lo_ in capacity and character, where the _personnel_\r\nwas continually changing, the outcome was necessarily varied. The\r\nlargest element of success lay in the fact that the majority of the\r\nfreedmen were willing, even eager, to work. So labor contracts were\r\nwritten,\xe2\x80\x94fifty thousand in a single State,\xe2\x80\x94laborers advised, wages\r\nguaranteed, and employers supplied. In truth, the organization became a\r\nvast labor bureau,\xe2\x80\x94not perfect, indeed, notably defective here and\r\nthere, but on the whole successful beyond the dreams of thoughtful men.\r\nThe two great obstacles which confronted the officials were the tyrant\r\nand the idler,\xe2\x80\x94the slaveholder who was determined to perpetuate slavery\r\nunder another name; and, the freedman who regarded freedom as perpetual\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x94the Devil and the Deep Sea.\r\n\r\nIn the work of establishing the Negroes as peasant proprietors, the\r\nBureau was from the first handicapped and at last absolutely checked.\r\nSomething was done, and larger things were planned; abandoned lands\r\nwere leased so long as they remained in the hands of the Bureau, and a\r\ntotal revenue of nearly half a million dollars derived from black\r\ntenants. Some other lands to which the nation had gained title were\r\nsold on easy terms, and public lands were opened for settlement to the\r\nvery few freedmen who had tools and capital. But the vision of \xe2\x80\x9cforty\r\nacres and a mule\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the righteous and reasonable ambition to become a\r\nlandholder, which the nation had all but categorically promised the\r\nfreedmen\xe2\x80\x94was destined in most cases to bitter disappointment. And those\r\nmen of marvellous hindsight who are today seeking to preach the Negro\r\nback to the present peonage of the soil know well, or ought to know,\r\nthat the opportunity of binding the Negro peasant willingly to the soil\r\nwas lost on that day when the Commissioner of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau had\r\nto go to South Carolina and tell the weeping freedmen, after their\r\nyears of toil, that their land was not theirs, that there was a\r\nmistake\xe2\x80\x94somewhere. If by 1874 the Georgia Negro alone owned three\r\nhundred and fifty thousand acres of land, it was by grace of his thrift\r\nrather than by bounty of the government.\r\n\r\nThe greatest success of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau lay in the planting of\r\nthe free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary\r\neducation among all classes in the South. It not only called the\r\nschool-mistresses through the benevolent agencies and built them\r\nschoolhouses, but it helped discover and support such apostles of human\r\nculture as Edmund Ware, Samuel Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath. The\r\nopposition to Negro education in the South was at first bitter, and\r\nshowed itself in ashes, insult, and blood; for the South believed an\r\neducated Negro to be a dangerous Negro. And the South was not wholly\r\nwrong; for education among all kinds of men always has had, and always\r\nwill have, an element of danger and revolution, of dissatisfaction and\r\ndiscontent. Nevertheless, men strive to know. Perhaps some inkling of\r\nthis paradox, even in the unquiet days of the Bureau, helped the\r\nbayonets allay an opposition to human training which still to-day lies\r\nsmouldering in the South, but not flaming. Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and\r\nHampton were founded in these days, and six million dollars were\r\nexpended for educational work, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\r\nof which the freedmen themselves gave of their poverty.\r\n\r\nSuch contributions, together with the buying of land and various other\r\nenterprises, showed that the ex-slave was handling some free capital\r\nalready. The chief initial source of this was labor in the army, and\r\nhis pay and bounty as a soldier. Payments to Negro soldiers were at\r\nfirst complicated by the ignorance of the recipients, and the fact that\r\nthe quotas of colored regiments from Northern States were largely\r\nfilled by recruits from the South, unknown to their fellow soldiers.\r\nConsequently, payments were accompanied by such frauds that Congress,\r\nby joint resolution in 1867, put the whole matter in the hands of the\r\nFreedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau. In two years six million dollars was thus\r\ndistributed to five thousand claimants, and in the end the sum exceeded\r\neight million dollars. Even in this system fraud was frequent; but\r\nstill the work put needed capital in the hands of practical paupers,\r\nand some, at least, was well spent.\r\n\r\nThe most perplexing and least successful part of the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s work lay\r\nin the exercise of its judicial functions. The regular Bureau court\r\nconsisted of one representative of the employer, one of the Negro, and\r\none of the Bureau. If the Bureau could have maintained a perfectly\r\njudicial attitude, this arrangement would have been ideal, and must in\r\ntime have gained confidence; but the nature of its other activities and\r\nthe character of its _personnel_ prejudiced the Bureau in favor of the\r\nblack litigants, and led without doubt to much injustice and annoyance.\r\nOn the other hand, to leave the Negro in the hands of Southern courts\r\nwas impossible. In a distracted land where slavery had hardly fallen,\r\nto keep the strong from wanton abuse of the weak, and the weak from\r\ngloating insolently over the half-shorn strength of the strong, was a\r\nthankless, hopeless task. The former masters of the land were\r\nperemptorily ordered about, seized, and imprisoned, and punished over\r\nand again, with scant courtesy from army officers. The former slaves\r\nwere intimidated, beaten, raped, and butchered by angry and revengeful\r\nmen. Bureau courts tended to become centres simply for punishing\r\nwhites, while the regular civil courts tended to become solely\r\ninstitutions for perpetuating the slavery of blacks. Almost every law\r\nand method ingenuity could devise was employed by the legislatures to\r\nreduce the Negroes to serfdom,\xe2\x80\x94to make them the slaves of the State, if\r\nnot of individual owners; while the Bureau officials too often were\r\nfound striving to put the \xe2\x80\x9cbottom rail on top,\xe2\x80\x9d and gave the freedmen a\r\npower and independence which they could not yet use. It is all well\r\nenough for us of another generation to wax wise with advice to those\r\nwho bore the burden in the heat of the day. It is full easy now to see\r\nthat the man who lost home, fortune, and family at a stroke, and saw\r\nhis land ruled by \xe2\x80\x9cmules and niggers,\xe2\x80\x9d was really benefited by the\r\npassing of slavery. It is not difficult now to say to the young\r\nfreedman, cheated and cuffed about who has seen his father\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nbeaten to a jelly and his own mother namelessly assaulted, that the\r\nmeek shall inherit the earth. Above all, nothing is more convenient\r\nthan to heap on the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau all the evils of that evil day,\r\nand damn it utterly for every mistake and blunder that was made.\r\n\r\nAll this is easy, but it is neither sensible nor just. Someone had\r\nblundered, but that was long before Oliver Howard was born; there was\r\ncriminal aggression and heedless neglect, but without some system of\r\ncontrol there would have been far more than there was. Had that control\r\nbeen from within, the Negro would have been re-enslaved, to all intents\r\nand purposes. Coming as the control did from without, perfect men and\r\nmethods would have bettered all things; and even with imperfect agents\r\nand questionable methods, the work accomplished was not undeserving of\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nSuch was the dawn of Freedom; such was the work of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBureau, which, summed up in brief, may be epitomized thus: for some\r\nfifteen million dollars, beside the sums spent before 1865, and the\r\ndole of benevolent societies, this Bureau set going a system of free\r\nlabor, established a beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured the\r\nrecognition of black freedmen before courts of law, and founded the\r\nfree common school in the South. On the other hand, it failed to begin\r\nthe establishment of good-will between ex-masters and freedmen, to\r\nguard its work wholly from paternalistic methods which discouraged\r\nself-reliance, and to carry out to any considerable extent its implied\r\npromises to furnish the freedmen with land. Its successes were the\r\nresult of hard work, supplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the\r\neager striving of black men. Its failures were the result of bad local\r\nagents, the inherent difficulties of the work, and national neglect.\r\n\r\nSuch an institution, from its wide powers, great responsibilities,\r\nlarge control of moneys, and generally conspicuous position, was\r\nnaturally open to repeated and bitter attack. It sustained a searching\r\nCongressional investigation at the instance of Fernando Wood in 1870.\r\nIts archives and few remaining functions were with blunt discourtesy\r\ntransferred from Howard\xe2\x80\x99s control, in his absence, to the supervision\r\nof Secretary of War Belknap in 1872, on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation.\r\nFinally, in consequence of grave intimations of wrong-doing made by the\r\nSecretary and his subordinates, General Howard was court-martialed in\r\n1874. In both of these trials the Commissioner of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau\r\nwas officially exonerated from any wilful misdoing, and his work\r\ncommended. Nevertheless, many unpleasant things were brought to\r\nlight,\xe2\x80\x94the methods of transacting the business of the Bureau were\r\nfaulty; several cases of defalcation were proved, and other frauds\r\nstrongly suspected; there were some business transactions which savored\r\nof dangerous speculation, if not dishonesty; and around it all lay the\r\nsmirch of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bank.\r\n\r\nMorally and practically, the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bank was part of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBureau, although it had no legal connection with it. With the prestige\r\nof the government back of it, and a directing board of unusual\r\nrespectability and national reputation, this banking institution had\r\nmade a remarkable start in the development of that thrift among black\r\nfolk which slavery had kept them from knowing. Then in one sad day came\r\nthe crash,\xe2\x80\x94all the hard-earned dollars of the freedmen disappeared; but\r\nthat was the least of the loss,\xe2\x80\x94all the faith in saving went too, and\r\nmuch of the faith in men; and that was a loss that a Nation which\r\nto-day sneers at Negro shiftlessness has never yet made good. Not even\r\nten additional years of slavery could have done so much to throttle the\r\nthrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and bankruptcy of the\r\nseries of savings banks chartered by the Nation for their especial aid.\r\nWhere all the blame should rest, it is hard to say; whether the Bureau\r\nand the Bank died chiefly by reason of the blows of its selfish friends\r\nor the dark machinations of its foes, perhaps even time will never\r\nreveal, for here lies unwritten history.\r\n\r\nOf the foes without the Bureau, the bitterest were those who attacked\r\nnot so much its conduct or policy under the law as the necessity for\r\nany such institution at all. Such attacks came primarily from the\r\nBorder States and the South; and they were summed up by Senator Davis,\r\nof Kentucky, when he moved to entitle the act of 1866 a bill \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\npromote strife and conflict between the white and black races\xe2\x80\xa6 by a\r\ngrant of unconstitutional power.\xe2\x80\x9d The argument gathered tremendous\r\nstrength South and North; but its very strength was its weakness. For,\r\nargued the plain common-sense of the nation, if it is unconstitutional,\r\nunpractical, and futile for the nation to stand guardian over its\r\nhelpless wards, then there is left but one alternative,\xe2\x80\x94to make those\r\nwards their own guardians by arming them with the ballot. Moreover, the\r\npath of the practical politician pointed the same way; for, argued this\r\nopportunist, if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white\r\nvotes, we certainly can with black votes. So justice and force joined\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe alternative thus offered the nation was not between full and\r\nrestricted Negro suffrage; else every sensible man, black and white,\r\nwould easily have chosen the latter. It was rather a choice between\r\nsuffrage and slavery, after endless blood and gold had flowed to sweep\r\nhuman bondage away. Not a single Southern legislature stood ready to\r\nadmit a Negro, under any conditions, to the polls; not a single\r\nSouthern legislature believed free Negro labor was possible without a\r\nsystem of restrictions that took all its freedom away; there was\r\nscarcely a white man in the South who did not honestly regard\r\nEmancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a duty. In\r\nsuch a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black man was a\r\nnecessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race,\r\nand the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of\r\nthe war. Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race\r\nfeud. And some felt gratitude toward the race thus sacrificed in its\r\nswaddling clothes on the altar of national integrity; and some felt and\r\nfeel only indifference and contempt.\r\n\r\nHad political exigencies been less pressing, the opposition to\r\ngovernment guardianship of Negroes less bitter, and the attachment to\r\nthe slave system less strong, the social seer can well imagine a far\r\nbetter policy,\xe2\x80\x94a permanent Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, with a national system of\r\nNegro schools; a carefully supervised employment and labor office; a\r\nsystem of impartial protection before the regular courts; and such\r\ninstitutions for social betterment as savings-banks, land and building\r\nassociations, and social settlements. All this vast expenditure of\r\nmoney and brains might have formed a great school of prospective\r\ncitizenship, and solved in a way we have not yet solved the most\r\nperplexing and persistent of the Negro problems.\r\n\r\nThat such an institution was unthinkable in 1870 was due in part to\r\ncertain acts of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau itself. It came to regard its\r\nwork as merely temporary, and Negro suffrage as a final answer to all\r\npresent perplexities. The political ambition of many of its agents and\r\n_prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s_ led it far afield into questionable activities, until the\r\nSouth, nursing its own deep prejudices, came easily to ignore all the\r\ngood deeds of the Bureau and hate its very name with perfect hatred. So\r\nthe Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau died, and its child was the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe passing of a great human institution before its work is done, like\r\nthe untimely passing of a single soul, but leaves a legacy of striving\r\nfor other men. The legacy of the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau is the heavy\r\nheritage of this generation. To-day, when new and vaster problems are\r\ndestined to strain every fibre of the national mind and soul, would it\r\nnot be well to count this legacy honestly and carefully? For this much\r\nall men know: despite compromise, war, and struggle, the Negro is not\r\nfree. In the backwoods of the Gulf States, for miles and miles, he may\r\nnot leave the plantation of his birth; in well-nigh the whole rural\r\nSouth the black farmers are peons, bound by law and custom to an\r\neconomic slavery, from which the only escape is death or the\r\npenitentiary. In the most cultured sections and cities of the South the\r\nNegroes are a segregated servile caste, with restricted rights and\r\nprivileges. Before the courts, both in law and custom, they stand on a\r\ndifferent and peculiar basis. Taxation without representation is the\r\nrule of their political life. And the result of all this is, and in\r\nnature must have been, lawlessness and crime. That is the large legacy\r\nof the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, the work it did not do because it could not.\r\n\r\nI have seen a land right merry with the sun, where children sing, and\r\nrolling hills lie like passioned women wanton with harvest. And there\r\nin the King\xe2\x80\x99s Highways sat and sits a figure veiled and bowed, by which\r\nthe traveller\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps hasten as they go. On the tainted air broods\r\nfear. Three centuries\xe2\x80\x99 thought has been the raising and unveiling of\r\nthat bowed human heart, and now behold a century new for the duty and\r\nthe deed. The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the\r\ncolor-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nOf Mr. Booker T.
