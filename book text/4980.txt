Burgess\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: Reddy Fox Brings Granny News\r\n\r\n   Pray who is there who would refuse\r\n   To bearer be of happy news?\r\n      --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nSnow covered the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and ice bound the\r\nSmiling Pool and the Laughing Brook. Reddy and Granny Fox were hungry\r\nmost of the time. It was not easy to find enough to eat these days, and\r\nso they spent nearly every minute they were awake in hunting. Sometimes\r\nthey hunted together, but usually one went one way, and the other went\r\nanother way so as to have a greater chance of finding something. If\r\neither found enough for two, the one finding it took the food back to\r\ntheir home if it could be carried. If not, the other was told where to\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nFor several days they had had very little indeed to eat, and they were\r\nso hungry that they were willing to take almost any chance to get a good\r\nmeal. For two nights they had visited Farmer Brown's henhouse, hoping\r\nthat they would be able to find a way inside. But the biddies had been\r\nsecurely locked up, and try as they would, they couldn't find a way in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's of no use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny, as they started back home after the\r\nsecond try, \xe2\x80\x9cto hope to get one of those hens at night. If we are going\r\nto get any at all, we will have to do it in broad daylight. It can\r\nbe done, for I have done it before, but I don't like the idea. We are\r\nlikely to be seen, and that means that Bowser the Hound will be set to\r\nhunting us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? It's easy enough to fool him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cI never yet saw a young Fox\r\nwho didn't think he knew all there is to know, and you're just like the\r\nrest. When you've lived as long as I have you will have learned not to\r\nbe quite so sure of your own opinions. I grant you that when there is no\r\nsnow on the ground, any Fox with a reasonable amount of Fox sense in his\r\nhead can fool Bowser, but with snow everywhere it is a very different\r\nmatter. If Bowser once takes it into his head to follow your trail these\r\ndays, you will have to be smarter than I think you are to fool him. The\r\nonly way you will be able to get away from him will be by going into\r\na hole in the ground, and when you do that you will have given away a\r\nsecret that will mean we will never have any peace at all. We will never\r\nknow when Farmer Brown's boy will take it into his head to smoke us out.\r\nI've seen it done. No, Sir, we are not going to try for one of those\r\nhens in the daytime unless we are starving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm starving now,\xe2\x80\x9d whined Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Granny snapped. \xe2\x80\x9cI've been without food longer than\r\nthis many a time. Have you been over to the Big River lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the use? It's frozen over. There isn't\r\nanything there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I learned a long time ago that it\r\nis a poor plan to overlook any chance. There is a place in the Big River\r\nwhich never freezes because the water runs too swiftly to freeze, and\r\nI've found more than one meal washed ashore there. You go over there now\r\nwhile I see what I can find in the Green Forest. If neither of us finds\r\nanything, it will be time enough to think about Farmer Brown's hens\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch against his will Reddy obeyed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't the least bit of use,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ngrumbled, as he trotted towards the Big River. \xe2\x80\x9cThere won't be anything\r\nthere. It is just a waste of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon he came hurrying back, and Granny knew by the way\r\nthat he cocked his ears and carried his tail that he had news of some\r\nkind. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found a dead fish that had been washed ashore,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwasn't big enough for two, so I ate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Granny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-o,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, nothing that will do us any\r\ngood. Quacker the Wild Duck was swimming about out in the open water,\r\nbut though I watched and watched he never once came ashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is good news. I think we'll go Duck\r\nhunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: Granny And Reddy Fox Go Hunting\r\n\r\n   When you're in doubt what course is right,\r\n   The thing to do is just sit tight.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nJolly, round, bright Mr. Sun had just got well started on his daily\r\nclimb up in the blue, blue sky that morning when he spied two figures\r\ntrotting across the snow-covered Green Meadows, one behind the other.\r\nThey were trotting along quite as if they had made up their minds just\r\nwhere they were going. They had. You see they were Granny and Reddy Fox,\r\nand they were bound for the Big River at the place where the water ran\r\ntoo swiftly to freeze. The day before Reddy had discovered Quacker the\r\nWild Duck swimming about there, and now they were on their way to try to\r\ncatch him.\r\n\r\nGranny led the way and Reddy meekly followed her. To tell the truth,\r\nReddy hadn't the least idea that they would have a chance to catch\r\nQuacker, because Quacker kept out in the water where he was as safe from\r\nthem as if they were a thousand miles away. The only reason that Reddy\r\nhad willingly started with Granny was the hope that he might find a dead\r\nfish washed up on the shore as he had the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranny certainly is growing foolish in her old age,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Reddy, as\r\nhe trotted along behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cI told her that Quacker never once came\r\nashore all the time I watched yesterday. I don't believe he ever comes\r\nashore, and if she knows anything at all she ought to know that she\r\ncan't catch him out there in the water. Granny used to be smart enough\r\nwhen she was young, I guess, but she certainly is losing her mind now.\r\nIt's a pity, a great pity. I can just imagine how Quacker will laugh at\r\nher. I have to laugh myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did laugh, but you may be sure he took great pains that Granny should\r\nnot see him laughing. Whenever she looked around he was as sober as\r\ncould be. In fact, he appeared to be quite as eager as if he felt sure\r\nthey would catch Quacker. Now old Granny Fox is very wise in the ways of\r\nthe Great World, and if Reddy could have known what was going on in her\r\nmind as she led the way to the Big River, he might not have felt quite\r\nso sure of his own smartness. Granny was doing some quiet laughing\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks I'm old and foolish and don't know what I'm about, the young\r\nscamp!\xe2\x80\x9d thought she. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks he has learned all there is to learn. It\r\nisn't the least use in the world to try to tell him anything. When young\r\nfolks feel the way he does, it is a waste of time to talk to them.\r\nHe has got to be shown. There is nothing like experience to take the\r\nconceit out of these youngsters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow conceit is the feeling that you know more than any one else. Perhaps\r\nyou do. Then again, perhaps you don't. So sometimes it is best not to\r\nbe too sure of your own opinion. Reddy was sure. He trotted along behind\r\nold Granny Fox and planned smart things to say to her when she found\r\nthat there wasn't a chance to catch Quacker the Duck. I am afraid,\r\nvery much afraid, that Reddy was planning to be saucy. People who think\r\nthemselves smart are quite apt to be saucy.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to the bank of the Big River. Old Granny Fox told\r\nReddy to sit still while she crept up behind some bushes where she could\r\npeek out over the Big River. He grinned as he watched her. He was still\r\ngrinning when she tiptoed back. He expected to see her face long with\r\ndisappointment. Instead she looked very much pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuacker is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think he will make us a very good\r\ndinner. Creep up behind those bushes and see for yourself, then come\r\nback here and tell me what you think we'd better do to get him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Reddy stole up behind the bushes, and this time it was Granny who\r\ngrinned as she watched. As he crept along, Reddy wondered if it could be\r\nthat for once Quacker had come ashore. Granny seemed so sure they could\r\ncatch him that this must be the case. But when he peeped through the\r\nhushes, there was Quacker way out in the middle of the open water just\r\nwhere he had been the day before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: Reddy Is Sure Granny Has Lost Her Senses\r\n\r\n   Perhaps 'tis just as well that we\r\n   Can't see ourselves as others see.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Reddy Fox as he peeped through the bushes\r\non the bank of the Big River and saw Quacker swimming about in the water\r\nwhere it ran too swiftly to freeze. \xe2\x80\x9cWe've got just as much chance of\r\ncatching him as I have of jumping over the moon. That's what I'll tell\r\nGranny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crept back carefully so as not to be seen by Quacker, and when he had\r\nreached the place where Granny was waiting for him, his face wore a very\r\nimpudent look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny Fox, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat shall we do to catch him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearn to swim like a fish and fly like a bird,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy in such a\r\nsaucy tone that Granny had hard work to keep from boxing his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you think he can't be caught?\xe2\x80\x9d said she quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think anything about it; I know he can't!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nby us, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you wouldn't even try?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Granny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm old enough to know when I'm wasting my time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy with a\r\ntoss of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words you think I'm a silly old Fox who has lost her senses,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Granny sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-o. I didn't say that,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Reddy, looking very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you think it,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, Mr. Smarty, you do\r\njust as I tell you. You creep back there where you can watch Quacker and\r\nall that happens, and mind that you keep out of his sight. Now go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy went. There was nothing else to do. He didn't dare disobey.\r\nGranny watched until Reddy had readied his hiding-place. Then what do\r\nyou think she did? Why, she walked right out on the little beach just\r\nbelow Reddy and in plain sight of Quacker! Yes, Sir, that is what she\r\ndid!\r\n\r\nThen began such a queer performance that it is no wonder that Reddy was\r\nsure Granny had lost her senses. She rolled over and over. She chased\r\nher tail round and round until it made Reddy dizzy to watch her. She\r\njumped up in the air. She raced back and forth. She played with a bit\r\nof stick. And all the time she didn't pay the least attention to Quacker\r\nthe Duck.\r\n\r\nReddy stared and stared. Whatever had come over Granny? She was crazy.\r\nYes, Sir, that must be the matter. It must be that she had gone without\r\nfood so long that she had gone crazy. Poor Granny! She was in her second\r\nchildhood. Reddy could remember how he had done such things when he was\r\nvery young, just by way of showing how fine he felt. But for a grown-up\r\nFox to do such things was undignified, to say the least. You know Reddy\r\nthinks a great deal of dignity. It was worse than undignified; it was\r\npositively disgraceful. He did hope that none of his neighbors would\r\nhappen along and see Granny cutting up so. He never would hear the end\r\nof it if they did.\r\n\r\nOver and over rolled Granny, and around and around she chased her tail.\r\nThe snow flew up in a cloud. And all the time she made no sound. Reddy\r\nwas just trying to decide whether to go off and leave her until she had\r\nregained her common sense, or to go out and try to stop her, when he\r\nhappened to look out in the open water where Quacker was. Quacker was\r\nsitting up as straight as he could. In fact, he had his wings raised to\r\nhelp him sit up on his tail, the better to see what old Granny Fox was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I live,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Reddy, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that fellow is nearer than he\r\nwas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy crouched lower than ever, and instead of watching Granny he\r\nwatched Quacker the Duck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: Quacker The Duck Grows Curious\r\n\r\n   The most curious thing in the world is curiosity.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nOld Granny Fox never said a truer thing than that. It is curious, very\r\ncurious, how sometimes curiosity will get the best of even the wisest\r\nand most sensible of people. Even Old Granny Fox herself has been known\r\nto be led into trouble by it. We expect it of Peter Rabbit, but Peter\r\nisn't a bit more curious than some others of whom we do not expect it.\r\n\r\nNow Quacker the Wild Duck is the last one in the world you would expect\r\nto be led into trouble by curiosity. Quacker had spent the summer in the\r\nFar North with Honker the Goose. In fact, he had been born there. He had\r\nstarted for the far away Southland at the same time Honker had, but when\r\nhe reached the Big River he had found plenty to eat and had decided to\r\nstay until he had to move on. The Big River had frozen over everywhere\r\nexcept in this one place where the water was too swift to freeze, and\r\nthere Quacker had remained. You see, he was a good diver and on the\r\nbottom of the river he found plenty to eat. No one could get at him\r\nout there, unless it were Roughleg the Hawk, and if Roughleg did happen\r\nalong, all he had to do was to dive and come up far away to laugh and\r\nmake fun of Roughleg. The water couldn't get through his oily feathers,\r\nand so he didn't mind how cold it was.\r\n\r\nNow in his home in the Far North there were so many dangers that Quacker\r\nhad early learned to be always on the watch and to take the best of care\r\nof himself. On his way down to the Big River he had been hunted by men\r\nwith terrible guns, and he had learned all about them. In fact, he felt\r\nquite able to keep out of harm's way. He rather prided himself that\r\nthere was no one smart enough to catch him.\r\n\r\nI suspect he thought he knew all there was to know. In this respect he\r\nwas a good deal like Reddy Fox himself. That was because he was young.\r\nIt is the way with young Ducks and Foxes and with some other youngsters\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nWhen Quacker first saw Granny Fox on the little beach, he flirted his\r\nabsurd little tail and smiled as he thought how she must wish she could\r\ncatch him. But so far as he could see, Granny didn't once look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn't know I'm out here at all,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Quacker. Then suddenly\r\nhe sat up very straight and looked with all his might. What under the\r\nsun was the matter with that Fox? She was acting as if she had suddenly\r\nlost her senses.\r\n\r\nOver and over she rolled. Around and around she spun. She turned\r\nsomersaults. She lay on her back and kicked her heels in the air.\r\nNever in his life had he known any one to act like that. There must be\r\nsomething the matter with her.\r\n\r\nQuacker began to get excited. He couldn't keep his eyes off Old Granny\r\nFox. He began to swim nearer. He wanted to see better. He quite forgot\r\nshe was a Fox. She moved so fast that she was just a queer red spot on\r\nthe beach. Whatever she was doing was very curious and very exciting. He\r\nswam nearer and nearer. The excitement was catching. He began to swim in\r\ncircles himself. All the time he drew nearer and nearer to the shore. He\r\ndidn't have the least bit of fear. He was just curious. He wanted to see\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAll the time Granny was cutting up her antics, she was watching Quacker,\r\nthough he didn't suspect it. As he swam nearer and nearer to the shore,\r\nGranny rolled and tumbled farther and farther back. At last Quacker was\r\nclose to the shore. If he kept on, he would be right on the land in a\r\nfew minutes. And all the time he stared and stared. No thought of danger\r\nentered his head. You see, there was no room because it was so filled\r\nwith curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a minute more I'll have him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Granny, and whirled faster\r\nthan ever. And just then something happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: Reddy Fox Is Afraid To Go Home\r\n\r\n   Yes, Sir, a chicken track is good to see, but\r\n   it often puts nothing but water in my mouth.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nReddy Fox thought of that saying many times as he hunted through the\r\nGreen Forest that night, afraid to go home. You see, he had almost dined\r\non Quacker the Duck over at the Big River that day and then hadn't, and\r\nit was all his own fault. That was why he was afraid to go home. From\r\nhis hiding-place on the bank he had watched Quacker swim in and in until\r\nhe was almost on the shore where old Granny Fox was whirling and rolling\r\nand tumbling about as if she had entirely lost her senses. Indeed, Reddy\r\nhad been quite sure that she had when she began. It wasn't until he saw\r\nthat curiosity was drawing Quacker right in so that in a minute or two\r\nGranny would be able to catch him, that he understood that Granny was\r\nanything but crazy, and really was teaching him a new trick as well as\r\ntrying to catch a dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen he realized this, he should have been ashamed of himself for\r\ndoubting the smartness of Granny and for thinking that he knew all there\r\nwas to know. But he was too much excited for any such thoughts. Nearer\r\nand nearer to the shore came Quacker, his eyes fixed on the red,\r\nwhirling form of Granny. Reddy's own eyes gleamed with excitement. Would\r\nQuacker keep on right up to the shore? Nearer and nearer and nearer he\r\ncame. Reddy squirmed uneasily. He couldn't see as well as he wanted to.\r\nThe bushes behind which he was lying were in his way. He wanted to see\r\nGranny make that jump which would mean a dinner for both.\r\n\r\nForgetting what Granny had charged him, Reddy eagerly raised his head to\r\nlook over the edge of the bank. Now it just happened that at that very\r\nminute Quacker chanced to look that way. His quick eyes caught the\r\nmovement of Reddy's head and in an instant all his curiosity vanished.\r\nThat sharp face peering at him over the edge of the bank could mean but\r\none thing--danger! It was all a trick! He saw through it now. Like a\r\nflash he turned. There was the whistle of stiff wings beating the air\r\nand the patter of feet striking the water as he got under way. Then he\r\nflew out to the safety of the open water. Granny sprang, but she was\r\njust too late and succeeded in doing no more than wet her feet.\r\n\r\nOf course, Granny didn't know what had frightened Quacker, not at first,\r\nanyway. But she had her suspicions. She turned and looked up at the\r\nplace where Reddy had been hiding. She couldn't see him. Then she\r\nbounded up the bank. There was no Reddy there, but far away across the\r\nsnow-covered Green Meadows was a red spot growing smaller and smaller.\r\nReddy was running away. Then she knew. At first Granny was very angry.\r\nYou know it is a dreadful thing to be hungry and have a good dinner\r\ndisappear just as it is almost within reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll teach that young scamp a lesson he won't soon forget when I get\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, as she watched him. Then she went back to the edge\r\nof the Big River and there she found a dead fish which had been washed\r\nashore. It was a very good fish, and when she had eaten it Granny felt\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she, \xe2\x80\x9cI have taught him a new trick and one he is n't\r\nlikely to forget. He knows now that Granny still knows a few tricks that\r\nhe doesn't, and next time he won't feel so sure he knows it all. I guess\r\nit was worth while even if I didn't catch Quacker. My, but he would have\r\ntasted good!\xe2\x80\x9d Granny smacked her lips and started for home.\r\n\r\nBut Reddy, with a guilty conscience, was afraid to go home. And so,\r\nmiserable and hungry, he hunted through the Green Forest all the long\r\nnight and wished and wished that he had heeded what old Granny Fox had\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: Old Granny Fox Is Caught Napping\r\n\r\n   The wisest folks will make mistakes, but\r\n   if they are truly wise they will profit from them.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying among the little people of the Green Forest and the\r\nGreen Meadows which runs something like this:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9cYou must your eyes wide open keep\r\n   To catch Old Granny Fox asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course this means that Old Granny Fox is so smart, so clever, so\r\nkeenly on the watch at all times, that he must be very smart indeed\r\nwho fools her or gets ahead of her. Reddy Fox is smart, very smart. But\r\nReddy isn't nearly as smart as Old Granny Fox. You see, he hasn't lived\r\nnearly as long, so of course there is much knowledge of many things\r\nstored away in Granny's head of which Reddy knows little.\r\n\r\nBut once in a while even the smartest people are caught napping. Yes,\r\nSir, that does happen. They will be careless sometimes. It was just so\r\nwith Old Granny Fox. With all her smartness and cleverness and wisdom\r\nshe grew careless, and all the smartness and cleverness and wisdom in\r\nthe world is useless if the possessor becomes careless.\r\n\r\nYou see, Old Granny Fox had become so used to thinking that she was\r\nsmarter than any one else, unless it was Old Man Coyote, that she\r\nactually believed that no one was smart enough ever to surprise her.\r\nYes, Sir, she actually believed that. Now, you know when a person\r\nreaches the point of thinking that no one else in all the Great World is\r\nquite so smart, that person is like Peter Rabbit when he made ready one\r\nwinter day to jump out on the smooth ice of the Smiling Pool,--getting\r\nready for a fall. It was this way with Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nBecause she had lived near Farmer Brown's so long and had been hunted\r\nso often by Farmer Brown's boy and by Bowser the Hound, she had got the\r\nidea in her head that no matter what she did they would not be able to\r\ncatch her. So at last she grew careless. Yes, Sir, she grew careless.\r\nAnd that is something no Fox or anybody else can afford to do.\r\n\r\nNow on the edge of the Green Forest was a warm, sunny knoll, which, as\r\nyou know, is a sort of little hill. It overlooked the Green Meadows and\r\nwas quite the most pleasant and comfortable place for a sun-nap that\r\never was. At least, that is what Old Granny Fox thought. She took\r\nsun-naps there very often. It was her favorite resting place. When\r\nBowser the Hound had found her trail and had chased her until she\r\nwas tired of running and had had quite all the exercise she needed or\r\nwanted, she would play one of her clever tricks by which to make Bowser\r\nlose her trail. Then she would hurry straight to that knoll to rest and\r\ngrin at her own smartness.\r\n\r\nIt happened that she did this one day when there was fresh snow on the\r\nground. Of course, every time she put a foot down she left a print in\r\nthe snow. And where she curled up in the sun she left the print of her\r\nbody. They were very plain to see, were these prints, and Farmer Brown's\r\nboy saw them.\r\n\r\nHe had been tramping through the Green Forest late in the afternoon\r\nand just by chance happened across Granny's footprints. Just for fun he\r\nfollowed them and so came to the sunny knoll. Granny had left some time\r\nbefore, but of course she couldn't take the print of her body with\r\nher. That remained in the snow, and Farmer Brown's boy saw it and knew\r\ninstantly what it meant. He grinned, and could Granny Fox have seen that\r\ngrin, she would have been uncomfortable. You see, he knew that he had\r\nfound the place where Granny was in the habit of taking a sun-nap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the place where you rest, Old Mrs. Fox, after\r\nrunning Bowser almost off his feet. I think we will give you a surprise\r\none of these days. Yes, indeed, I think we will give you a surprise. You\r\nhave fooled us many times, and now it is our turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day Farmer Brown's boy shouldered his terrible gun and sent\r\nBowser the Hound to hunt for the trail of Old Granny Fox. It wasn't long\r\nbefore Bowser's great voice told all the Great World that he had found\r\nGranny's tracks. Farmer Brown's boy grinned just as he had the day\r\nbefore. Then with his terrible gun he went over to the Green Forest and\r\nhid under some pine boughs right on the edge of that sunny knoll.\r\n\r\nHe waited patiently a long, long time. He heard Bowser's great voice\r\ngrowing more and more excited as he followed Old Granny Fox. By and by\r\nBowser stopped baying and began to yelp impatiently. Farmer Brown's boy\r\nknew exactly what that meant. It meant that Granny had played one of her\r\nsmart tricks and Bowser had lost her trail.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later out of the Green Forest came Old Granny Fox, and\r\nshe was grinning, for once more she had fooled Bowser the Hound and\r\nnow could take a nap in peace. Still grinning, she turned around two\r\nor three times to make herself comfortable and then, with a sigh of\r\ncontentment, curled up for a sun-nap, and in a few minutes was asleep.\r\nAnd just a little way off behind the pine boughs sat Farmer Brown's boy\r\nholding his terrible gun and grinning. At last he had caught Old Granny\r\nFox napping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: Granny Fox Has A Bad Dream\r\n\r\n   Nothing ever simply happens;\r\n    Bear that point in mind.\r\n   If you look long and hard enough\r\n    A cause you'll always find.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nOld Granny Fox was dreaming. Yes, Sir, she was dreaming. There she lay,\r\ncurled up on the sunny little knoll on the edge of the Green Forest,\r\nfast asleep and dreaming. It was a very pleasant and very comfortable\r\nplace indeed. You see, jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun poured his warmest\r\nrays right down there from the blue, blue sky. When Old Granny Fox was\r\ntired, she often slipped over there for a short nap and sun-bath even\r\nin winter. She was quite sure that no one knew anything about it. It was\r\none of her secrets.\r\n\r\nThis morning Old Granny Fox was very tired, unusually so. In the first\r\nplace she had been out hunting all night. Then, before she could reach\r\nhome, Bowser the Hound had found her tracks and started to follow them.\r\nOf course, it wouldn't have done to go home then. It wouldn't have done\r\nat all. Bowser would have followed her straight there and so found out\r\nwhere she lived. So she had led Bowser far away across the Green Meadows\r\nand through the Green Forest and finally played one of her smart tricks\r\nwhich had so mixed her tracks that Bowser could no longer follow them.\r\nWhile he had sniffed and snuffed and snuffed and sniffed with that\r\nwonderful nose of his, trying to find out where she had gone, Old Granny\r\nFox had trotted straight to the sunny knoll and there curled up to rest.\r\nRight away she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNow Old Granny Fox, like most of the other little people of the Green\r\nForest and the Green Meadows, sleeps with her ears wide open. Her eyes\r\nmay be closed, but not her ears. Those are always on guard, even when\r\nshe is asleep, and at the least sound open fly her eyes, and she is\r\nready to run. If it were not for the way her sharp ears keep guard, she\r\nwouldn't dare take naps in the open right in broad daylight. If you\r\never want to catch a Fox asleep, you mustn't make the teeniest, weeniest\r\nnoise. Just remember that.\r\n\r\nNow Old Granny Fox had no sooner closed her eyes than she began to\r\ndream. At first it was a very pleasant dream, the pleasantest dream a\r\nFox can have. It was of a chicken dinner, all the chicken she could eat.\r\nGranny certainly enjoyed that dream. It made her smack her lips quite as\r\nif it were a real and not a dream dinner she was enjoying.\r\n\r\nBut presently the dream changed and became a bad dream. Yes, indeed,\r\nit became a bad dream. It was as bad as at first it had been good. It\r\nseemed to Granny that Bowser the Hound had become very smart, smarter\r\nthan she had ever known him to be before. Do what she would, she\r\ncouldn't fool him. Not one of all the tricks she knew, and she knew a\r\ngreat many, fooled him at all. They didn't puzzle him long enough for\r\nher to get her breath.\r\n\r\nBowser kept getting nearer and nearer and nearer, all in the dream, you\r\nknow, until it seemed as if his great voice sounded right at her very\r\nheels. She was so tired that it seemed to her that she couldn't run\r\nanother step. It was a very, very real dream. You know dreams sometimes\r\ndo seem very real indeed. This was the way it was with the bad dream\r\nof Old Granny Fox. It seemed to her that she could feel the breath of\r\nBowser the Hound and that his great jaws were just going to close on her\r\nand shake her to death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Granny and waked herself up. Her eyes flew open. Then\r\nshe gave a great sigh of relief as she realized that her terrible fright\r\nwas only a bad dream and that she was curled up right on the dear,\r\nfamiliar, old, sunny knoll and not running for her life at all.\r\n\r\nOld Granny Fox smiled to think what a fright she had had and\r\nthen,--well, she didn't know whether she was really awake or still\r\ndreaming! No, Sir, she didn't. For a full minute she couldn't be sure\r\nwhether what she saw was real or part of that dreadful dream. You see,\r\nshe was staring into the face of Farmer Brown's boy and the muzzle of\r\nhis dreadful gun!\r\n\r\nFor just a few seconds she didn't move. She couldn't. She was too\r\nfrightened to move. Then she knew what she saw was real and not a dream\r\nat all. There wasn't the least bit of doubt about it. That was Farmer\r\nBrown's boy, and that was his dreadful gun! All in a flash she knew that\r\nFarmer Brown's boy must have been hiding behind those pine boughs.\r\n\r\nPoor Old Granny Fox! For once in her life she had been caught napping.\r\nShe hadn't the least hope in the world. Farmer Brown's boy had only to\r\nfire that dreadful gun, and that would be the end of her. She knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: What Farmer Brown's Boy Did\r\n\r\n   In time of danger heed this rule:\r\n   Think hard and fast, but pray keep cool.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nPoor Old Granny Fox! She had thought that she had been in tight places\r\nbefore, but never, never had she been in such a tight place as this.\r\nThere stood Farmer Brown's boy looking along the barrel of his dreadful\r\ngun straight at her, and only such a short distance, such a very short\r\ndistance away! It wasn't the least bit of use to run. Granny knew that.\r\nThat dreadful gun would go \xe2\x80\x9cbang!\xe2\x80\x9d and that would be the end of her.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds she stared at Farmer Brown's boy, too frightened\r\nto move or even think. Then she began to wonder why that dreadful gun\r\ndidn't go off. What was Farmer Brown's boy waiting for? She got to\r\nher feet. She was sure that the first step would be her last, yet she\r\ncouldn't stay there.\r\n\r\nHow could Fanner Brown's boy do such a dreadful thing? Somehow, his\r\nfreckled face didn't look cruel. He was even beginning to grin. That\r\nmust be because he had caught her napping and knew that this time she\r\ncouldn't possibly get away from him as she had so many times before.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Old Granny Fox under her breath.\r\n\r\nAnd right at that very instant Farmer Brown's boy did something. What do\r\nyou think it was? No, he didn't shoot her. He didn't fire his dreadful\r\ngun. What do you think he did do? Why, he threw a snowball at Old Granny\r\nFox and shouted \xe2\x80\x9cBoo!\xe2\x80\x9d That is what he did and all he did, except to\r\nlaugh as Granny gave a great leap and then made those black legs of hers\r\nfly as never before.\r\n\r\nEvery instant Granny expected to hear that dreadful gun, and it seemed\r\nas if her heart would burst with fright as she ran, thinking each jump\r\nwould be the last one. But the dreadful gun didn't bang, and after a\r\nlittle, when she felt she was safe, she turned to look back over her\r\nshoulder. Farmer Brown's boy was standing right where she had last seen\r\nhim, and he was laughing harder than ever. Yes, Sir, he was laughing,\r\nand though Old Granny Fox didn't think so at the time, his laugh was\r\ngood to hear, for it was good-natured and merry and all that an honest\r\nlaugh should be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo it, Granny! Go it!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Farmer Brown's boy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next time\r\nyou are tempted to steal my chickens, just remember that I caught you\r\nnapping and let you off when I might have shot you. Just remember that\r\nand leave my chickens alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow it happened that Tommy Tit the Chickadee had seen all that\r\nhad happened, and he fairly bubbled over with joy. \xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee,\r\nChickadee! It is just as I have always said--Farmer Brown's boy isn't\r\nbad. He'd be friends with every one if every one would let him,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, maybe,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Sammy Jay, who also had seen all that had\r\nhappened. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he's altogether too smart for me to trust. Oh, my! oh,\r\nmy! What news this will be to tell! Old Granny Fox will never hear the\r\nend of it. If ever again she boasts of how smart she is, all we will\r\nhave to do will be to remind her of the time Farmer Brown's boy caught\r\nher napping. Ho! ho! ho! I must hurry along and find my cousin, Blacky\r\nthe Crow. This will tickle him half to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs for Old Granny Fox, she feared Farmer Brown's boy more than ever, not\r\nbecause of what he had done to her but because of what he had not done.\r\nYou see, nothing could make her believe that he wanted to be her friend.\r\nShe thought he had let her get away just to show her that he was smarter\r\nthan she. Instead of thankfulness, hate and fear filled Granny's heart.\r\nYou know--\r\n\r\n   People who themselves do ill\r\n   For others seldom have good will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX: Reddy Fox Hears About Granny Fox\r\n\r\n   Though you may think another wrong\r\n    And be quite positive you're right,\r\n   Don't let your temper get away;\r\n    And try at least to be polite.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nSammy Jay hurried through the Green Forest, chuckling as he flew. Sammy\r\nwas brimming over with the news he had to tell,--how Old Granny Fox had\r\nbeen caught napping by Farmer Brown's boy. Sammy wouldn't have believed\r\nit if any one had told him. No, Sir, he wouldn't. But he had seen it\r\nwith his own eyes, and it tickled him almost to pieces to think that Old\r\nGranny Fox, whom everybody thought so sly and clever and smart, had been\r\ncaught actually asleep by the very one of whom she was most afraid, but\r\nat whom she always had turned up her nose.\r\n\r\nPresently Sammy spied Reddy Fox trotting along the Lone Little Path.\r\nReddy was forever boasting of how smart Granny Fox was. He had boasted\r\nof it so much that everybody was sick of hearing him. When he saw Reddy\r\ntrotting along the Lone Little Path, Sammy chuckled harder than ever. He\r\nhid in a thick hemlock-tree and as Reddy passed he shouted:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cHad I such a stupid old Granny\r\n    As some folks who think they are smart,\r\n  I never would boast of my Granny,\r\n    But live by myself quite apart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy looked up angrily. He couldn't see Sammy Jay, but he knew Sammy's\r\nvoice. There is no mistaking that. Everybody knows the voice of Sammy\r\nJay. Of course it was foolish, very foolish of Reddy to be angry, and\r\nstill more foolish to show that he was angry. Had he stopped a minute to\r\nthink, he would have known that Sammy was saying such a mean, provoking\r\nthing just to make him angry, and that the angrier he became the better\r\npleased Sammy Jay would be. But like a great many people, Reddy allowed\r\nhis temper to get the better of his common sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says Granny Fox is stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sammy Jay promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI say she is stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is smarter than anybody else in all the Green Forest and on all the\r\nGreen Meadows. She is smarter than anybody else in all the Great World,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n boasted Reddy, and he really believed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn't smart enough to fool Farmer Brown's boy,\xe2\x80\x9d taunted Sammy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's that? Who says so? Has anything happened to Granny Fox?\xe2\x80\x9d Reddy\r\nforgot his anger in a sudden great fear. Could Granny have been shot by\r\nFarmer Brown's boy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much, only Farmer Brown's boy caught her napping in broad\r\ndaylight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sammy, and chuckled so that Reddy heard him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe a word of it!\r\nNobody ever yet caught Old Granny Fox napping, and nobody ever will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care whether you believe it or not; it's so, for I saw him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n retorted Sammy Jay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--you--you--\xe2\x80\x9d began Reddy Fox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ask Tommy Tit the Chickadee if it isn't true. He saw him too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n interrupted Sammy Jay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee, Chickadee! It's so, and Farmer Brown's boy only threw a\r\nsnowball at her and let her run away without shooting at her,\xe2\x80\x9d declared\r\na new voice. There sat Tommy Tit himself.\r\n\r\nReddy didn't know what to think or say. He just couldn't believe it,\r\nyet he had never known Tommy Tit to tell an untruth. Sammy Jay alone\r\nhe wouldn't have believed. Then Tommy Tit and Sammy Jay told Reddy\r\nall about what they had seen, how Farmer Brown's boy had surprised Old\r\nGranny Fox and then allowed her to go unharmed. Reddy had to believe\r\nit. If Tommy Tit said it was so, it must be so. Reddy Fox started off to\r\nhunt up Old Granny Fox and ask her about it. But a sudden thought popped\r\ninto his red head, and he changed his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't say a thing about it until some time when Granny scolds me for\r\nbeing careless,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Reddy, with a sly grin. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I'll see what\r\nshe has to say. I guess she won't scold me so much after this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy grinned more than ever, which wasn't a bit nice of him. Instead of\r\nbeing sorry that Old Granny Fox had had such a fright, he was planning\r\nhow he would get even with her when she should scold him for his own\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X: Reddy Fox Is Impudent\r\n\r\n   A saucy tongue is dangerous to possess;\r\n   Be sure some day 't will get you in a mess.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nReddy Fox is headstrong and, like most headstrong people, is given to\r\nthinking that his way is the best way just because it is his way. He is\r\nsmart, is Reddy Fox. Yes, indeed, Reddy Fox is very, very smart. He has\r\nto be in order to live. But a great deal of what he knows he learned\r\nfrom Old Granny Fox. The very best tricks he knows she taught him. She\r\nbegan teaching him when he was so little that he tumbled over his own\r\nfeet. It was she who taught him how to hunt, that it is better never to\r\nsteal chickens near home but to go a long way off for them, and how to\r\nfool Bowser the Hound.\r\n\r\nIt was Granny who taught Reddy how to use his little black nose to\r\nfollow the tracks of careless young Rabbits, and how to catch Meadow\r\nMice under the snow. In fact, there is little Reddy knows which he\r\ndidn't learn from wise, shrewd Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nBut as he grew bigger and bigger, until he was quite as big as Granny\r\nherself, he forgot what he owed to her. He grew to have a very good\r\nopinion of himself and to feel that he knew just about all there was\r\nto know. So sometimes when he had done foolish or careless things and\r\nGranny had scolded him, telling him he was big enough and old enough to\r\nknow better, he would sulk and go off muttering to himself. But he never\r\nquite dared to be openly disrespectful to Granny, and this, of course,\r\nwas quite as it should have been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could catch Granny doing something foolish or careless,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwould say to himself. But he never could, and he had begun to think that\r\nhe never would. But now at last Granny, clever Old Granny Fox, had been\r\ncareless! She had allowed Farmer Brown's boy to catch her napping! Reddy\r\ndid wish he had been there to see it himself. But anyway, he had been\r\ntold about it, and he made up his mind that the next time Granny said\r\nanything sharp to him about his carelessness he would have something to\r\nsay back. Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox was deliberately planning to answer back,\r\nwhich, as you know, is always disrespectful to one's elders.\r\n\r\nAt last the chance came. Reddy did a thing no truly wise Fox ever will\r\ndo. He went two nights in succession to the same henhouse, and the\r\nsecond time he barely escaped being shot. Old Granny Fox found out about\r\nit. How she found out Reddy doesn't know to this day, but find out\r\nshe did, and she gave him such a scolding as even her sharp tongue had\r\nseldom given him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the stupidest Fox I ever heard of,\xe2\x80\x9d scolded Granny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm no more stupid than you are!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Reddy in the most impudent\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's that?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's that you said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I'm no more stupid than you are, and what is more, I hope I'm\r\nnot so stupid. I know better than to take a nap in broad daylight right\r\nunder the very nose of Farmer Brown's boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Reddy grinned in the most\r\nimpudent way as he said this.\r\n\r\nGranny's eyes snapped. Then things happened. Reddy was cuffed this way\r\nand cuffed that way and cuffed the other way until it seemed to him that\r\nthe air was full of black paws, every one of which landed on his head\r\nor face with a sting that made him whimper and put his tail between his\r\nlegs, and finally howl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Granny, when at last she had to stop because she was\r\nquite out of breath. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that will teach you to be respectful to\r\nyour elders. I was careless and stupid, and I am perfectly ready to\r\nadmit it, because it has taught me a lesson. Wisdom often is gained\r\nthrough mistakes, but never when one is not willing to admit the\r\nmistakes. No Fox lives long who makes the same mistake twice. And those\r\nwho are impudent to their elders come to no good end. I've got a fat\r\ngoose hidden away for dinner, but you will get none of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I wish I'd never heard of Granny's mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d whined Reddy to himself\r\nas he crept dinnerless to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to wish that you hadn't been impudent,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a small\r\nvoice down inside him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI: After The Storm\r\n\r\n   The joys and the sunshine that make us glad;\r\n   The worries and troubles that makes us sad\r\n   Must come to an end; so why complain\r\n   Of too little sun or too much rain?\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nThe thing to do is to make the most of the sunshine while it lasts, and\r\nwhen it rains to look forward to the corning of the sun again, knowing\r\nthat conic it surely will. A dreadful storm was keeping the little\r\npeople of the Green Forest, the Green Meadows, and the Old Orchard\r\nprisoners in their own homes or in such places of shelter as they had\r\nbeen able to find.\r\n\r\nBut it couldn't last forever, and they knew it. Knowing this was all\r\nthat kept some of them alive.\r\n\r\nYou see, they were starving. Yes, Sir, they were starving. You and I\r\nwould be very hungry, very hungry indeed, if we had to go without food\r\nfor two whole days, but if we were snug and warm it wouldn't do us any\r\nreal harm. With the little wild friends, especially the little feathered\r\nfolks, it is a very different matter. You see, they are naturally so\r\nactive that they have to fill their stomachs very often in order to\r\nsupply their little bodies with heat and energy. So when their food\r\nsupply is wholly cut off, they starve or else freeze to death in a very\r\nshort time. A great many little lives are ended this way in every long,\r\nhard winter storm.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon of the second day when rough Brother North\r\nWind decided that he had shown his strength and fierceness long enough,\r\nand rumbling and grumbling retired from the Green Meadows and the Green\r\nForest, blowing the snow clouds away with him. For just a little while\r\nbefore it was time for him to go to bed behind the Purple Hills, jolly,\r\nround, red Mr. Sun smiled down on the white land, and never was his\r\nsmile more welcome. Out from their shelters hurried all the little\r\nprisoners, for they must make the most of the short time before the\r\ncoming of the cold night.\r\n\r\nLittle Tommy Tit the Chickadee was so weak that he could hardly fly, and\r\nhe shook with chills. He made straight for the apple-tree where Farmer\r\nBrown's boy always keeps a piece of suet tied to a branch for Tommy and\r\nhis friends. Drummer the Woodpecker was there before him. Now it is\r\none of the laws of politeness among the feathered folk that when one is\r\neating from a piece of suet a newcomer shall await his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy Tit faintly but cheerfully, for he couldn't\r\nbe other than cheery if he tried. \xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee! That looks good to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Drummer, pecking away at the suet greedily. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\non, Tommy Tit. Don't wait for me, for I won't be through for a long\r\ntime. I'm nearly starved, and I guess you must be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed Tommy, as he flew over beside Drummer. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you ever\r\nso much for not making me wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Drummer, with his mouth full. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is no\r\ntime for politeness. Here comes Yank Yank the Nuthatch. I guess there is\r\nroom for him too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYank Yank was promptly invited to join them and did so after apologizing\r\nfor seeming so greedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I couldn't get my stomach full before night, I certainly should\r\nfreeze to death before morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a blessing it is to have\r\nall this good food waiting for us. If I had to hunt for my usual food\r\non the trees, I certainly should have to give up and die. It took all\r\nmy strength to get over here. My, I feel like a new bird already! Here\r\ncomes Sammy Jay. I wonder if he will try to drive us away as he usually\r\ndoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSammy did nothing of the kind. He was very meek and most polite.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you make room for a starving fellow to get a bite?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwouldn't ask it but that I couldn't last another night without food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee! Always room for one more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tommy Tit, crowding\r\nover to give Sammy room. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn't that a dreadful storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorst I ever knew,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Sammy. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I ever will be warm\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUntil their stomachs were full, not another word was said. Meanwhile\r\nChatterer the Red Squirrel had discovered that the storm was over. As he\r\nfloundered through the snow to another apple-tree he saw Tommy Tit\r\nand his friends, and in his heart he rejoiced that they had found food\r\nwaiting for them. His own troubles were at an end, for in the tree he\r\nwas headed for was a store of corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: Granny And Reddy Fox Hunt In Vain\r\n\r\n   Old Mother Nature's plans for good\r\n   Quite often are not understood.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nTommy Tit and Drummer the Woodpecker and Yank Yank the Nuthatch and\r\nSammy Jay and Chatterer the Red Squirrel were not the only ones who were\r\nout and about as soon as the great storm ended. Oh, my, no! No, indeed!\r\nEverybody who was not sleeping the winter away, or who had not a store\r\nof food right at hand, was out. But not all were so fortunate as Tommy\r\nTit and his friends in finding a good meal.\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit and Mrs. Peter came out of the hole in the heart of the\r\ndear Old Briar-patch, where they had managed to keep comfortably warm,\r\nand at once began to fill their stomachs with bark from young trees and\r\ntender tips of twigs. It was very coarse food, but it would take away\r\nthat empty feeling. Mrs. Grouse burst out of the snow and hurried to\r\nget a meal before dark. She had no time to be particular, and so she ate\r\nspruce buds. They were very bitter and not much to her liking, but she\r\nwas too hungry, and night was too near for her to be fussy. She was\r\nthankful to have that much.\r\n\r\nGranny Fox and Reddy were out too. They didn't need to hurry because, as\r\nyou know, they could hunt all night, but they were so hungry that they\r\njust had to be looking for something to eat. They knew, of course, that\r\neverybody else would be out, and they hoped that some of these little\r\npeople would be so weak that they could easily be caught. That seems\r\nlike a dreadful hope, doesn't it? But one of the first laws of Old\r\nMother Nature is self-preservation. That means to save your own life\r\nfirst. So perhaps Granny and Reddy are not to be blamed for hoping that\r\nsome of their neighbors might be caught easily because of the great\r\nstorm. They were very hungry indeed, and they could not eat bark like\r\nPeter Rabbit, or buds like Mrs. Grouse, or seeds like Whitefoot the\r\nWoodmouse. Their teeth and stomachs are not made for such food.\r\n\r\nIt was hard going for Granny and Reddy Fox. The snow was soft and deep\r\nin many places, and they had to keep pretty close to those places where\r\nrough Brother North Wind had blown away enough of the snow to make\r\nwalking fairly easy. They soon found that their hope that they would\r\nfind some of their neighbors too weak to escape was quite in vain. When\r\njolly, round, red Mr. Sun dropped clown behind the Purple Hills to go to\r\nbed, their stomachs were quite as empty as when they had started out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll go down to the Old Briar-patch. I don't believe it will be of\r\nmuch use, but you never can tell until you try. Peter Rabbit may take it\r\ninto his silly head to come outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny, leading the way.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the dear Old Briar-patch they found that Peter was not\r\noutside. In fact, peering between the brambles and bushes, they could\r\nsee his little brown form bobbing about as he hunted for tender bark. He\r\nhad already made little paths along which he could hop easily. Peter saw\r\nthem almost as soon as they saw him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard times these,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope your stomachs are not\r\nas empty as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled a strip of bark from a young tree and began\r\nto chew it. This was more than Reddy could stand. To see Peter eating\r\nwhile his own stomach was just one great big ache from emptiness was too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going in there and catch him, or drive him out where you can catch\r\nhim, if I tear my coat all to pieces!\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Reddy.\r\n\r\nPeter stopped chewing and sat up. \xe2\x80\x9cCome right along, Reddy. Come right\r\nalong if you want to, but I would advise you to save your skin and your\r\ncoat,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nReddy's only reply was a snarl as he pushed his way under the brambles.\r\nHe yelped as they tore his coat and scratched his face, but he kept on.\r\nNow Peter's paths were very cunningly made. He had cut them through the\r\nvery thickest of the briars just big enough for himself and Mrs. Peter\r\nto hop along comfortably. But Reddy is so much bigger that he had to\r\nforce his way through and in places crawl flat on his stomach, which was\r\nvery slow work, to say nothing of the painful scratches from the briars.\r\nIt was no trouble at all for Peter to keep out of his way, and before\r\nlong Reddy gave up. Without a word Granny Fox led the way to the Green\r\nForest. They would try to find where Mrs. Grouse was sleeping under the\r\nsnow. But though they hunted all night, they failed to find her, for she\r\nwisely had gone to bed in a spruce-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII: Granny Fox Admits Growing Old\r\n\r\n   Who will not admit he is older each day\r\n   fools no one but himself.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nOld Granny Fox is a spry old lady for her age. If you don't believe it\r\njust try to catch her. But spry as she is, she isn't as spry as she used\r\nto be. No, Sir, Granny Fox isn't as spry as she used to be. The truth\r\nis, Granny is getting old. She never would admit it, and Reddy never had\r\nrealized it until the day after the great storm. All that night they had\r\nhunted in vain for something to eat and at daylight had crept into their\r\nhouse to rest awhile before starting on another hunt. They had neither\r\nthe strength nor the courage to search any longer then. Wading through\r\nsnow is very hard work at best and very tiresome, but when your stomach\r\nhas been empty for so long that you almost begin to wonder what food\r\ntastes like, it becomes harder work still. You see, it is food that\r\nmakes strength, and lack of food takes away strength.\r\n\r\nThis was why Granny and Reddy Fox just HAD to rest. Hungry as they were,\r\nthey HAD to give up for awhile. Reddy flung himself down, and if ever\r\nthere was a discouraged young Fox he was that one. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I were dead,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he moaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, tut!\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny Fox sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's no way for a young Fox\r\nto talk! I'm ashamed of you. I am indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added more kindly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know just how you feel. Just try to forget your empty stomach and\r\nrest awhile. We have had a tiresome, disappointing, discouraging night,\r\nbut when you are rested things will not look quite so bad. You know the\r\nold saying:\r\n\r\n 'Never a road so long is there\r\n   But it reaches a turn at last;\r\n  Never a cloud that gathers swift But\r\n   disappears as fast.'\r\n\r\nYou think you couldn't possibly feel any worse than you do right now,\r\nbut you could. Many a time I have had to go hungry longer than this.\r\nAfter we have rested awhile we will go over to the Old Pasture. Perhaps\r\nwe will have better luck there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Reddy tried to forget the emptiness of his stomach and actually had a\r\nnap, for he was very, very tired. When he awoke he felt better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Granny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9clet's start for the Old Pasture. The snow\r\nhas crusted over, and we won't find it such hard going as it was last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranny arose and followed Reddy out to the doorstep. She walked stiffly.\r\nThe truth is, she ached in every one of her old bones. At least, that is\r\nthe way it seemed to her. She looked towards the Old Pasture. It seemed\r\nvery far away. She sighed wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe I'll go, Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou run along and luck go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy turned and stared at Granny suspiciously. You know his is a very\r\nsuspicious nature. Could it be that Granny had some secret plan of her\r\nown to get a meal and wanted to get rid of him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded roughly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was you who\r\nproposed going over to the Old Pasture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranny smiled. It was a sad sort of smile. She is wonderfully sharp and\r\nsmart, is Granny Fox, and she knew what was in Reddy's mind as well as\r\nif he had told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld bones don't rest and recover as quickly as young bones, and I just\r\ndon't feel equal to going over there now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is,\r\nReddy, I am growing old. I am going to stay right here and rest. Perhaps\r\nthen I'll feel able to go hunting to-night. You trot along now, and if\r\nyou get more than a stomachful, just remember old Granny and bring her a\r\nbite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in the way Granny spoke that told Reddy she was\r\nspeaking the truth. It was the very first time she ever had admitted\r\nthat she was growing old and was no longer the equal of any Fox. Never\r\nbefore had he noticed how gray she had grown. Reddy felt a feeling of\r\nshame creep over him,--shame that he had suspected Granny of playing a\r\nsharp trick. And this little feeling of shame was followed instantly by\r\na splendid thought. He would go out and find food of some kind, and he\r\nwould bring it straight back to Granny. He had been taken care of by\r\nGranny when he was little, and now he would repay Granny for all she had\r\ndone for him by taking care of her in her old age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back in the house and lie down, Granny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going\r\nto get something, and whatever it may be you shall have your share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n With this he trotted off towards the Old Pasture and somehow he didn't\r\nmind the ache in his stomach as he had before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV: Three Vain And Foolish Wishes\r\n\r\n   There's nothing so foolishly silly and vain\r\n   As to wish for a thing you can never attain.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nWe all know that, yet most of us are just foolish enough to make such a\r\nwish now and then. I guess you have done it. I know I have. Peter Rabbit\r\nhas done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards. I suspect that\r\neven shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty of it more than\r\nonce. So it is not surprising that Reddy Fox, terribly hungry as he was,\r\nshould do a little foolish wishing.\r\n\r\nWhen he left home to go to the Old Pasture, in the hope that he would\r\nbe able to find something to eat there, he started off bravely. It was\r\ncold, very cold indeed, but his fur coat kept him warm as long as he\r\nwas moving. The Green Meadows were glistening white with snow. All the\r\nworld, at least all that part of it with which Reddy was acquainted, was\r\nwhite. It was beautiful, very beautiful, as millions of sparkles flashed\r\nin the sun. But Reddy had no thought for beauty; the only thought he had\r\nroom for was to get something to put in the empty stomachs of himself\r\nand Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nJack Frost had hardened the snow so that Reddy no longer had to wade\r\nthrough it. He could run on the crust now without breaking through. This\r\nmade it much easier, so he trotted along swiftly. He had intended to go\r\nstraight to the Old Pasture, but there suddenly popped into his head\r\na memory of the shelter down in a far corner of the Old Orchard which\r\nFarmer Brown's boy had built for Bob White. Probably the Bob White\r\nfamily were there now, and he might surprise them. He would go there\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nReddy stopped and looked carefully to make sure that Farmer Brown's boy\r\nand Bowser the Hound were nowhere in sight. Then he ran swiftly towards\r\nthe Old Orchard. Just as he entered it he heard a merry voice just over\r\nhis head: \xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee, dee!\xe2\x80\x9d Reddy stopped and looked up. There was\r\nTommy Tit the Chickadee clinging tightly to a big piece of fresh suet\r\ntied fast to a branch of a tree, and Tommy was stuffing himself. Reddy\r\nsat down right underneath that suet and looked up longingly. The sight\r\nof it made his mouth water so that it was almost more than he could\r\nstand. He jumped once. He jumped twice. He jumped three times. But all\r\nhis jumping was in vain. That suet was beyond his reach. There was no\r\npossible way of reaching it save by flying or climbing. Reddy's tongue\r\nhung out of his mouth with longing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could climb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reddy.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't climb, and all the wishing in the world wouldn't enable\r\nhim to, as he very well knew. So after a little he started on. As he\r\ndrew near the far corner of the Old Orchard, he saw Bob White and Mrs.\r\nBob and all the young Bobs picking up grain which Farmer Brown's boy had\r\nscattered for them just in front of the shelter he had built for\r\nthem. Reddy crouched down and very slowly, an inch at a time, he crept\r\nforward, his eyes shining with eagerness. Just as he was almost within\r\nspringing distance, Bob White gave a signal, and away flew the Bob\r\nWhites to the safety of a hemlock-tree on the edge of the Green Forest.\r\n\r\nTears of rage and disappointment welled up in Reddy's eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\r\ncould fly,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as he watched the brown birds disappear in the\r\nbig hemlock-tree.\r\n\r\nThis was quite as foolish a wish as the other, so Reddy trotted on and\r\ndecided to go down past the Smiling Pool. When he got there he found it,\r\nas he expected, frozen over. But just where the Laughing Brook joins it\r\nthere was a little place where there was open water. Billy Mink was\r\non the ice at its edge, and just as Reddy got there Billy dived in. A\r\nminute later he climbed out with a fish in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a bite,\xe2\x80\x9d begged Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch your own fish,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Billy Mink. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to work hard enough\r\nfor what I get as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy was afraid to go out on the ice where Billy was, and so he sat and\r\nwatched him eat that fine fish. Then Billy dived into the water again\r\nand disappeared. Reddy waited a long time, but Billy did not return. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish I could dive,\xe2\x80\x9d gulped Reddy, thinking of the fine fish somewhere\r\nunder the ice.\r\n\r\nAnd this wish was quite as foolish as the other wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV: Reddy Fights A Battle\r\n\r\n     'T is not the foes that are without\r\n     But those that are within\r\n     That give us battles that we find\r\n     The hardest are to win.\r\n       --Old Granny Fox\r\n\r\nAfter the last of his three foolish wishes, Reddy Fox left the Smiling\r\nPool and headed straight for the Old Pasture for which he had started in\r\nthe first place. He wished now that he had gone straight there. Then he\r\nwouldn't have seen the suet tied out of reach to the branch of a tree in\r\nthe Old Orchard; he wouldn't have seen the Bob Whites fly away to safety\r\njust as he felt almost sure of catching one; he wouldn't have seen Billy\r\nMink bring a fine fish out of the water and eat it right before him. It\r\nis bad enough to be starving with no food in sight, but to be as hungry\r\nas Reddy Fox was and to see food just out of reach, to smell it, and\r\nnot be able to get it is,--well, it is more than most folks can stand\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\nSo Reddy Fox was grumbling to himself as he hurried to the Old Pasture\r\nand his heart was very bitter. It seemed to him that everything was\r\nagainst him. His neighbors had food, but he had none, not so much as a\r\ncrumb. It was unfair. Old Mother Nature was unjust. If he could climb he\r\ncould get food. If he could fly he could get food. If he could dive he\r\ncould get food. But he could neither climb, fly, nor dive. He didn't\r\nstop to think that Old Mother Nature had given him some of the sharpest\r\nwits in all the Green Forest or on all the Green Meadows; that she had\r\ngiven him a wonderful nose; that she had given him the keenest of ears;\r\nthat she had given him speed excelled by few. He forgot these things\r\nand was so busy thinking bitterly of the things he didn't have that\r\nhe forgot to use his wits and nose and ears when he reached the Old\r\nPasture. The result was that he trotted right past Old Jed Thumper,\r\nthe big gray Rabbit, who was sitting behind a little bush holding his\r\nbreath. The minute Old Jed saw that Reddy was safely past, he started\r\nfor his bull-briar castle as fast as he could.\r\n\r\nIt was not until then that Reddy discovered him. Of course, Reddy\r\nstarted after him, and this time he made good use of his speed. But he\r\nwas too late. Old Jed Thumper reached his castle with Reddy two jumps\r\nbehind him. Reddy knew now that there was no chance to catch Old Jed\r\nthat day, and for a few minutes he felt more bitter than ever. Then all\r\nin a flash Reddy Fox became the shrewd, clever fellow that he really is.\r\nhe grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's of no use to try to fill an empty stomach on wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had come straight here and minded my own business, I'd have caught\r\nold Jed Thumper. Now I'm going to get some food and I'm not going home\r\nuntil I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery wisely Reddy put all unpleasant thoughts out of his head and\r\nsettled down to using his wits and his eyes and his ears and his nose\r\nfor all they were worth, as Old Mother Nature had intended he should.\r\n\r\nAll through the Old Pasture he hunted, taking care not to miss a single\r\nplace where there was the least chance of finding food. But it was all\r\nin vain. Reddy gulped down his disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the Big River,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and started off bravely.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the edge of the Big River, he hurried along the bank\r\nuntil he reached a place where the water seldom freezes. As he had\r\nhoped, he found that it was not frozen now. It looked so black and cold\r\nthat it made him shiver just to see it. Back and forth with his nose\r\nto the ground he ran. Suddenly he stopped and sniffed. Then he sniffed\r\nagain. Then he followed his nose straight to the very edge of the Big\r\nRiver. There, floating in the black water, was a dead fish! By wading in\r\nhe could get it.\r\n\r\nReddy shivered at the touch of the cold water, but what were wet feet\r\ncompared with such an empty stomach as his? In a minute he had that fish\r\nand was back on the shore. It wasn't a very big fish, but it would stop\r\nthe ache in his stomach until he could get something more. With a sigh\r\nof pure happiness he sank his teeth into it and then--well, then he\r\nremembered poor Old Granny Fox. Reddy swallowed a mouthful and tried to\r\nforget Granny. But he couldn't. He swallowed another mouthful. Poor\r\nold Granny was back there at home as hungry as he was and too stiff and\r\ntired to hunt. Reddy choked. Then he began a battle with himself. His\r\nstomach demanded that fish. If he ate it, no one would be the wiser.\r\nBut Granny needed it even more than he did. For a long time Reddy fought\r\nwith himself. In the end he picked up the fish and started for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI: Reddy Is Made Truly Happy\r\n\r\n   It's what you do for others,\r\n   Not what they do for you,\r\n   That makes you feel so happy\r\n   All through and through and through.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nReddy Fox ran all the way home from the Big River just as fast as he\r\ncould go. In his mouth he carried the fish he had found and from which\r\nhe had taken just two bites. You remember he had had a battle with\r\nhimself over that fish, and now he was running away from himself. That\r\nsounds funny, doesn't it? But it was true. Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox was\r\nrunning away from himself. He was afraid that if he didn't get home to\r\nOld Granny Fox with that fish very soon, he would eat every last bit of\r\nit himself. So he was running his very hardest so as to get there before\r\nthis could happen. So really he was running away from himself, from his\r\nselfish self.\r\n\r\nOld Granny Fox was on the doorstep watching for him, and he saw just how\r\nher hungry old eyes brightened when she saw him and what he had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've brought you something to eat, Granny,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted, as he laid the\r\nfish at her feet. He was quite out of breath with running. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't\r\nmuch, but it is something. It is all I could find for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranny looked at the fish and then she looked sharply at Reddy, and into\r\nthose keen yellow eyes of hers crept a soft, tender look, such a look as\r\nyou would never have believed they could have held.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have YOU had to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Granny softly.\r\n\r\nReddy turned his head that Granny might not see his face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I've had\r\nsomething,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, trying to speak lightly. It was true; he had had\r\ntwo bites from that fish.\r\n\r\nNow you know just how shrewd and smart and wise Granny Fox is. Reddy\r\ndidn't fool her just the least little bit. She took two small bites from\r\nthe fish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwe'll divide it,\xe2\x80\x9d and she bit in two parts what\r\nremained. In a twinkling she had gulped down the smallest part, for you\r\nknow she was very, very hungry. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is your share,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as she\r\npushed what remained over to Reddy.\r\n\r\nReddy tried to refuse it. \xe2\x80\x9cI brought it all for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nyou did, Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny, and it seemed to Reddy that he never\r\nhad known her voice to sound so gentle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou brought it to me when all\r\nyou had had was the two little bites you had taken from it. You can't\r\nfool me, Reddy Fox. There wasn't one good meal for either of us in that\r\nfish, but there was enough to give us both a little hope and keep us\r\nfrom starving. Now you mind what I say and eat your share.\xe2\x80\x9d Granny said\r\nthis last very sternly.\r\n\r\nReddy looked at Granny, and then he bolted down that little piece of\r\nfish without another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will feel better, both of us. Now that\r\nI've something in my stomach, I feel two years younger. Before you came,\r\nI didn't feel as if I should ever be able to go on another hunt. If\r\nyou hadn't brought something, I--I'm afraid I couldn't have lasted much\r\nlonger. By another day you probably wouldn't have had old Granny to\r\nthink of. You may not know it, but I know that you saved my life, Reddy.\r\nI had reached a point where I just had to have a little food. You know\r\nthere are times when a very little food is of more good than a lot of\r\nfood could be later. This was one of those times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever in all his life had Reddy Fox felt so truly happy. He was still\r\nhungry,--very, very hungry. But he gave it no thought. He had saved\r\nGranny Fox, good old Granny who had taught him all he knew. And he knew\r\nthat Granny knew how he had had to fight with himself to do it. Reddy\r\nwas happy through and through with the great happiness that comes from\r\nhaving done something for some one else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny. And then she changed the\r\nsubject. \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you like to eat a dinner of Bowser the Hound's?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII: Granny Fox Promises Reddy Bowser's Dinner\r\n\r\n   To give her children what each needs\r\n   To get the most from life he can,\r\n   To work and play and live his best,\r\n   Is wise Old Mother Nature's plan.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nOld Granny Fox asked Reddy how he would like to eat a dinner of Bowser\r\nthe Hound's, Reddy looked at her sharply to see if she were joking\r\nor really meant what she said. Granny looked so sober and so much in\r\nearnest that Reddy decided she couldn't be joking, even though it did\r\nsound that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly would like it, Granny. Yes, indeed, I certainly would like\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou--you don't suppose he will give us one, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranny chuckled. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cBowser isn't so generous as all\r\nthat, especially to Foxes. He isn't going to give us that dinner; we are\r\ngoing to take it away from him. Yes, Sir, we just naturally are going to\r\ntake it away from, him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy didn't for the life of him see how it could be possible to take\r\na dinner away from Bowser the Hound. That seemed to him almost as\r\nimpossible as it was for him to climb or fly or dive. But he had great\r\nfaith in Granny's cleverness. He remembered how she had so nearly caught\r\nQuacker the Duck. He knew that all the time he had been away trying to\r\nfind something for them to eat, old Granny Fox had been doing more than\r\njust rest her tired old bones. He knew that not for one single minute\r\nhad her sharp wits been idle. He knew that all that time she had been\r\nstudying and studying to find some way by which they could get something\r\nto eat. So great was his faith in Granny just then that if she had told\r\nhim she would get him a slice of the moon he would have believed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you say we can take a dinner away from Bowser the Hound, I suppose\r\nwe can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reddy, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I don't see how. But if we can, let's do\r\nit right away. I'm hungry enough to dare almost anything for the sake of\r\nsomething to put in my stomach. It is so empty that little bit of fish\r\nwe divided is shaking around as if it were lost. Gracious, I could eat\r\na million fish the size of that one! Have you thought of Fanner Brown's\r\nhens, Granny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, Reddy! Of course! What a silly question!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may have to come to them yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was at them right now,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Reddy with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know what I have told you,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surest way of\r\ngetting into trouble is to steal hens. I'm not feeling quite up to being\r\nchased by Bowser the Hound just now, and if we came right home we would\r\ngive away the secret of where we live and might be smoked out, and that\r\nwould be the end of us. Besides, those hens will be hard to get this\r\nweather, because they will stay in their house, and there is no way for\r\nus to get in there unless we walk right in, in broad daylight, and that\r\nwould never do. It will be a great deal better to take Bowser's dinner\r\naway from him. In the first place, if we are careful, no one but Bowser\r\nwill know about it, and as long as he is chained up, we will have\r\nnothing to worry about from him. Besides, we will enjoy getting even\r\nwith him for the times he has spoiled our chances of catching a fat\r\nchicken and for the way he has hunted us. Most decidedly it will be\r\nbetter and safer to try for Bowser's dinner than to try for one of those\r\nhens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you say, Granny; just as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nbest. But how under the sun we can do it beats me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny, \xe2\x80\x9cvery simple indeed. Most things\r\nare simple enough when you find out how to do them. Neither of us could\r\ndo it alone, but together we can do it without the least bit of risk.\r\nListen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranny went close to Reddy and whispered to him, although there wasn't\r\na soul within hearing. A slow grin spread over Reddy's face as he\r\nlistened. When she had finished, he laughed right out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranny, you are a wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed admiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cI never should\r\nhave thought of that. Of course we can do it. My, won't Bowser be\r\nsurprised! And how mad he'll be! Come on, let's be starting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny, and the two started towards Farmer Brown's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII: Why Bowser The Hound Didn't Eat His Dinner\r\n\r\n   The thing you've puzzled most about\r\n   Is simple once you've found it out.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nBowser The Hound dearly loves to hunt just for the pleasure of the\r\nchase. It isn't so much the desire to kill as it is the pleasure of\r\nusing that wonderful nose of his and the excitement of trying to catch\r\nsome one, especially Granny or Reddy Fox. Farmer Brown's boy had put\r\naway his dreadful gun because he no longer wanted to kill the little\r\npeople of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, but rather to make\r\nthem his friends. Bowser had missed the exciting hunts he used to enjoy\r\nso much with Farmer Brown's boy. So Bowser had formed the habit of\r\nslipping away alone for a hunt every once in a while. When Farmer\r\nBrown's boy discovered this, he got a chain and chained Bowser to his\r\nlittle house to keep him from running away and hunting on the sly.\r\n\r\nOf course Bowser wasn't kept chained all the time. Oh, my, no! When his\r\nmaster was about, where he could keep an eye on Bowser, he would let him\r\ngo free. But whenever he was going away and didn't want to take Bowser\r\nwith him, he would chain Bowser up. Now Bowser always had one good big\r\nmeal a day. To be sure, he had scraps or a bone now and then besides,\r\nbut once a day he had one good big meal served to him in a large tin\r\npan. If he happened to be chained, it was brought out to him. If not, it\r\nwas given to him just outside the kitchen door.\r\n\r\nGranny Fox knew all about this. Sly old Granny makes it her business to\r\nknow the affairs of other people around her because there is no telling\r\nwhen such knowledge may be of use to her. So Granny had watched Bowser\r\nthe Hound when he and his master had no idea at all that she was\r\nanywhere about, and she had found out his ways, the usual hour for his\r\ndinner and just how far that chain would allow him to go. It was such\r\nthings which she had stored away in that shrewd old head of hers that\r\nmade her so sure she and Reddy could take Bowser's dinner away from him.\r\nIt was just about Bowser's dinner-time when Granny and Reddy trotted\r\nacross the snow-covered fields and crept behind the barn until they\r\ncould peep around the corner. No one was in sight, not even Bowser, who\r\nwas inside his warm little house at the end of the long shed back of\r\nFarmer Brown's house. Granny saw that he was chained and a sly grin\r\ncrept over her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stay right here and watch until his dinner is brought out to him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said she to Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as whoever brings it has gone back to the\r\nhouse you walk right out where Bowser will see you. At the sight of you,\r\nhe'll forget all about his dinner. Sit right down where he can see you\r\nand stay there until you see that I have got that dinner, or until you\r\nhear somebody coming, for you know Bowser will make a great racket. Then\r\nslip around back of the barn and join me back of that shed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Reddy sat down to watch, and Granny left him. By and by Mrs. Brown\r\ncame out of the house with a pan full of good things. She put it down\r\nin front of Bowser's little house and called to him. Then she turned and\r\nhurried back, for it was very cold. Bowser came out of his little house,\r\nyawned and stretched lazily.\r\n\r\nIt was time for Reddy to do his part. Out he walked and sat down right\r\nin front of Bowser and grinned at him. Bowser stared for a minute as\r\nif he doubted his own eyes. Such impudence! Bowser growled. Then with a\r\nyelp he sprang towards Reddy.\r\n\r\nNow the chain that held him was long, but Reddy had taken care not to\r\nget too near, and of course Bowser couldn't reach him. He tugged with\r\nall his might and yelped and barked frantically, but Reddy just sat\r\nthere and grinned in the most provoking manner. It was great fun to\r\ntease Bowser this way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile old Granny Fox had stolen out from around the corner of the\r\nshed behind Bowser. Getting hold of the edge of the pan with her teeth\r\nshe pulled it back with her around the corner and out of sight. If she\r\nmade any noise, Bowser didn't hear it. He was making too much noise\r\nhimself and was too excited. Presently Reddy heard the sound of an\r\nopening door. Mrs. Brown was coming to see what all the fuss was about.\r\nLike a flash Reddy darted behind the barn, and all Mrs. Brown saw was\r\nBowser tugging at his chain as he whined and yelped excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess he must have seen a stray cat or something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Brown\r\nand went back in the house. Bowser continued to whine and tug at his\r\nchain for a few minutes. Then he gave it up and, growling deep in his\r\nthroat, turned to eat his dinner. But there wasn't any dinner! It had\r\ndisappeared, pan and all! Bowser couldn't understand it at all.\r\n\r\nBack of the shed Granny and Reddy Fox licked that pan clean; licked\r\nit until it was polished. Then, with little sighs of satisfaction, and\r\nevery once in a while a chuckle, they trotted happily home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX: Old Man Coyote Does A Little Thinking\r\n\r\n   Investigate and for yourself find out\r\n   Those things which most you want to know about.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nNever in all his life had Reddy Fox enjoyed a dinner more than that one\r\nhe and Granny had stolen from Bowser the Hound. Of course it would have\r\ntasted delicious anyway, because they were so dreadfully hungry, but to\r\nReddy it tasted better still because it had been intended for Bowser.\r\nBowser has hunted Reddy so often that Reddy has no love for him at all,\r\nand it tickled him almost to death to think that they had taken his\r\ndinner from almost under his nose.\r\n\r\nWith that good dinner in their stomachs, Reddy and Granny Fox felt so\r\nmuch better that the Great World no longer seemed such a cold and cruel\r\nplace. Funny how differently things look when your stomach is full from\r\nthe way those same things look when it is empty. Best of all they knew\r\nthey could play the same sharp trick again and steal another dinner\r\nfrom Bowser if need be. It is a comforting feeling, a very comforting\r\nfeeling, to know for a certainty where you can get another meal. It is\r\na feeling that Granny and Reddy Fox and many other little people of the\r\nGreen Meadows and the Green Forest seldom have in winter. As a rule,\r\nwhen they have eaten one meal, they haven't the least idea where the\r\nnext one is coming from. How would you like to live that way?\r\n\r\nThe very next day Granny and Reddy went up to Farmer Brown's at Bowser's\r\ndinner hour. But this time Farmer Brown's boy was at work near the barn,\r\nand Bowser was not chained. Granny and Reddy stole away as silently as\r\nthey had come. On the day following they found Bowser chained and stole\r\nanother dinner from him; then they went away laughing until their sides\r\nached as they heard Bowser's whines of surprise and disappointment when\r\nhe discovered that his dinner had vanished. They knew by the sound of\r\nhis voice that he hadn't the least idea what had become of that dinner.\r\n\r\nNow there was some one else roaming over the snow-covered meadows and\r\nthrough the Green Forest and the Old Pasture these days with a stomach\r\nso lean and empty that he couldn't think of anything else. It was\r\nOld Man Coyote. You know he is very clever, is Old Man Coyote, and he\r\nmanaged to find enough food of one kind and another to keep him alive,\r\nbut never enough to give him that comfortable feeling of a full stomach.\r\nWhile he wasn't actually starving, he was always hungry. So he spent all\r\nthe time when he wasn't sleeping in hunting for something to eat.\r\n\r\nOf course he often ran across the tracks of Granny and Reddy Fox, and\r\nonce in a while he would meet them. It struck Old Man Coyote that they\r\ndidn't seem as thin as he was. That set him to thinking. Neither of\r\nthem was a smarter hunter than he. In fact, he prided himself on being\r\nsmarter than either of them. Yet when he met them, they seemed to be in\r\nthe best of spirits and not at all worried because food was so scarce.\r\nWhy? There must be a reason. They must be getting food of which he knew\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll just keep an eye on them,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Old Man Coyote.\r\n\r\nSo very slyly and cleverly Old Man Coyote followed Granny and Reddy Fox,\r\ntaking the greatest care that they should not suspect that he was doing\r\nit. All one night he followed them through the Green Forest and over the\r\nGreen Meadows, and when at last he saw them go home, appearing not at\r\nall worried because they had caught nothing, he trotted off to his own\r\nhome to do some more thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are getting food somewhere, that is sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as he\r\nscratched first one ear and then the other. Somehow he could think\r\nbetter when he was scratching his ears. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they don't get it in the\r\nnight, and they certainly didn't get anything this night, they must get\r\nit in the daytime. I've done considerable hunting myself in the daytime,\r\nand I haven't once met them in the Green Forest or seen them on the\r\nGreen Meadows or up in the Old Pasture. I wonder if they are stealing\r\nFarmer Brown's hens and haven't been found out yet. I've kept away from\r\nthere myself, but if they can steal hens and not be caught, I certainly\r\ncan. There never was a Fox yet smart enough to do a thing that a Coyote\r\ncannot do if he tries. I think I'll slip up where I can watch Farmer\r\nBrown's and see what is going on up there. Yes, Sir, that's what I'll\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, Old Man Coyote grinned and then curled himself up for a short\r\nnap, for he was tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX: A Twice Stolen Dinner\r\n\r\n   No one ever is so smart that some one else\r\n   may not prove to be smarter still.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nListen and you shall hear all about three rogues. Two were in red and\r\nwere Granny and Reddy Fox. And one was in gray and was Old Man Coyote.\r\nThey were the slyest, smartest rogues on all the Green Meadows or in all\r\nthe Green Forest. All three had started out to steal the same dinner,\r\nbut the funny part is they didn't intend to steal it from the same\r\nperson. And still funnier is it that one of them didn't even know where\r\nthat dinner was or what kind of a dinner it would be.\r\n\r\nTrue to his resolve to know what Granny and Reddy Fox were getting to\r\neat, and where they were getting it, Old Man Coyote hid where he could\r\nsee what was going on about Farmer Brown's, for it was there he felt\r\nsure that Granny and Reddy were getting food. He had waited only a\r\nlittle while when along came Granny and Reddy Fox past the place where\r\nOld Man Coyote was hiding. They didn't see him. Of course not. He took\r\ncare that they should have no chance. But anyway, they were not thinking\r\nof him. Their thoughts were all of that dinner they intended to have,\r\nand the smart trick by which they would get it.\r\n\r\nSo with their thoughts all on that dinner they slipped up behind the\r\nbarn and prepared to work the trick which had been so successful before.\r\nOld Man Coyote crept after them. He saw Reddy Fox lie down where he\r\ncould peep around the corner of the barn to watch Bowser the Hound and\r\nto see that no one else was about. He saw Granny leave Reddy there and\r\nhurry away. Old Man Coyote's wits worked fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't be in two places at once,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cso I can't watch both\r\nGranny and Reddy. As I can watch but one, which one shall it be? Granny,\r\nof course. Granny is the smartest of the two, and whatever they are up\r\nto, she is at the bottom of it. Granny is the one to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, like a gray shadow, crafty Old Man Coyote stole after Granny Fox and\r\nsaw her hide behind the corner of the shed at the end of which was the\r\nlittle house of Bowser the Hound. He crept as near as he dared and then\r\nlay flat down behind a little bunch of dead grass close to the shed. For\r\nsome time nothing happened, and Old Man Coyote was puzzled. Every once\r\nin a while Granny Fox would look behind and all about to be sure that no\r\ndanger was near, but she didn't see Old Man Coyote. After what seemed to\r\nhim a long time, he heard a door open on the other side of the shed. It\r\nwas Mrs. Brown carrying Bowser's dinner out to him. Of course, Old Man\r\nCoyote didn't know this. He knew by the sounds that some one had come\r\nout of the house, and it made him nervous. He didn't like being so\r\nclose to Farmer Brown's house in broad daylight. But he kept his eyes\r\non Granny Fox, and he saw her ears prick up in a way that he knew meant\r\nthat those sounds were just what she had been waiting for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she isn't afraid, I don't need to be,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he craftily. After a\r\nfew minutes he heard a door close and knew that whoever had come out had\r\ngone back into the house. Almost at once Bowser the Hound began to yelp\r\nand whine. Swiftly Granny Fox disappeared around the corner of the shed.\r\nJust as swiftly Old Man Coyote ran forward and peeped around the corner.\r\nThere was Bowser the Hound tugging at his chain, and just beyond his\r\nreach was Reddy Fox, grinning in the most provoking manner. And there\r\nwas Granny Fox, backing and dragging after her Bowser's dinner. In a\r\nflash Old Man Coyote understood the plan, and he almost chuckled aloud\r\nat the cleverness of it. Then he hastily backed behind the shed and\r\nwaited. In a minute Granny Fox appeared, dragging Bowser's dinner. She\r\nwas so intent on getting that dinner that she almost backed into Old Man\r\nCoyote without suspecting that he was anywhere about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Granny. You needn't bother about it any longer; I'll take it\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Old Man Coyote in Granny's ear.\r\n\r\nGranny let go of that dinner as if it burned her tongue, and with a\r\nfrightened little yelp leaped to one side. A minute later Reddy came\r\nracing around from behind the barn eager for his share. What he saw was\r\nOld Man Coyote bolting down that twice-stolen dinner while Granny Fox\r\nfairly danced with rage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI: Granny And Reddy Talk Things Over.\r\n\r\n   You'll find as on through life you go\r\n   The thing you want may prove to be\r\n   The very thing you shouldn't have.\r\n   Then seeming loss is gain, you see.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nIf ever two folks were mad away through, those two were Granny and Reddy\r\nFox as they watched Old Man Coyote gobble up the dinner they had so\r\ncleverly stolen from Bowser the Hound. It was bad enough to lose the\r\ndinner, but it was worse to see some one else eat it after they had\r\nworked so hard to get it. \xe2\x80\x9cRobber!\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Granny. Old Man Coyote\r\nstopped eating long enough to grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThief! Sneak! Coward!\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Reddy. Once more Old Man Coyote grinned.\r\nWhen that dinner had disappeared down his throat to the last and\r\nsmallest crumb, he licked his chops and turned to Granny and Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm very much obliged for that dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said he pleasantly, his eyes\r\ntwinkling with mischief. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the best dinner I have had for a long\r\ntime. Allow me to say that that trick of yours was as smart a trick as\r\never I have seen. It was quite worthy of a Coyote. You are a very clever\r\nold lady, Granny Fox. Now I hear some one coming, and I would suggest\r\nthat it will be better for all concerned if we are not seen about here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe darted off behind the barn like a gray streak, and Granny and Reddy\r\nfollowed, for it was true that some one was coming. You see Bowser the\r\nHound had discovered that something was going on around the corner of\r\nthe shed, and he made such a racket that Mrs. Brown had come out of the\r\nhouse to see what it was all about. By the time she got around there,\r\nall she saw was the empty pan which had held Bowser's dinner. She was\r\npuzzled. How that pan could be where it was she couldn't understand, and\r\nBowser couldn't tell her, although he tried his very best. She had been\r\npuzzled about that pan two or three times before.\r\n\r\nOld Man Coyote lost no time in getting back home, for he never felt easy\r\nnear the home of man in broad daylight. Granny and Reddy Fox went home\r\ntoo, and there was hate in their hearts,--hate for Old Man Coyote. But\r\nonce they reached home, Old Granny Fox stopped growling, and presently\r\nshe began to chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the way Old Man Coyote stole that dinner from us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate him! He's a sneaking robber!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, Reddy! Tut, tut!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cBe fair-minded. We stole\r\nthat dinner from Bowser the Hound, and Old Man Coyote stole it from us.\r\nI guess he is no worse than we are, when you come to think it over. Now\r\nis he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I--well, I don't suppose he is, when you put it that way,\xe2\x80\x9d Reddy\r\nadmitted grudgingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he was smart, very smart, to outwit two such clever people as we\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to agree to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-e-s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reddy slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was smart enough, but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn't any but, Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the law of\r\nthe Green Meadows and the Green Forest. It is everybody for himself, and\r\nanything belongs to one who has the wit or the strength to take it.\r\nWe had the wit to take that dinner from Bowser the Hound, and Old Man\r\nCoyote had the wit to take it from us and the strength to keep it. It\r\nwas all fair enough, and you know there isn't the least use in crying\r\nover spilled milk, as the saying is. We simply have got to be smart\r\nenough not to let him fool us again. I guess we won't get any more of\r\nBowser's dinners for a while. We've got to think of some other way of\r\nfilling our stomachs when the hunting is poor. I think if I could have\r\njust one of those fat hens of Farmer Brown's, it would put new strength\r\ninto my old bones. All summer I warned you to keep away from that\r\nhenyard, but the time has come now when I think we might try for a\r\ncouple of those hens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy pricked up his ears at the mention of fat hens. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall we try for one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cNow don't bother me while I think\r\nout a plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII: Granny Fox Plans To Get A Fat Hen\r\n\r\n   Full half success for Fox or Man\r\n   Is won by working out a plan.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nGranny Fox knows this. No one knows it better. Whatever she does is\r\nfirst carefully planned in her wise old head. So now after she had\r\ndecided that she and Reddy would try for one of Farmer Brown's fat hens,\r\nshe lay down to think out a plan to get that fat hen. No one knew better\r\nthan she how foolish it would be to go over to that henyard and just\r\ntrust to luck for a chance to catch one of those biddies. Of course,\r\nthey might be lucky and get a hen that way, but then again they might be\r\nunlucky and get in a peck of trouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Reddy, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must not only plan how to get that fat\r\nhen, but we must also plan how to get away with it safely. If only there\r\nwas some way of getting in that henhouse at night, there would be no\r\ntrouble at all. I don't suppose there is the least chance of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least chance in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn't a\r\nhole anywhere big enough for even Shadow the Weasel to get through, and\r\nFarmer Brown's boy is very careful to lock the door every night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's a little hole that the hens go in and out of during the day,\r\nwhich is big enough for one of us to slip through, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGranny thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! But it's always closed at night,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, to get\r\nto that or the door either, you have got to get inside the henyard, and\r\nthere's a gate to that which we can't open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are sometimes careless,--even you, Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny.\r\n\r\nReddy squirmed uneasily, for he had been in trouble many times through\r\ncarelessness. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded a wee bit crossly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much, only if that hen-yard gate should happen to be left open,\r\nand if Farmer Brown's boy should happen to forget to close that little\r\nhole that the hens go through, and if we happened to be around at just\r\nthat time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo many ifs to get a dinner with,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I've noticed that it is the one\r\nwho has an eye open for all the little ifs in life that fares the best.\r\nNow I've kept an eye on that henyard, and I've noticed that very often\r\nFarmer Brown's boy doesn't close the henyard gate at night. I suppose he\r\nthinks that if the henhouse door is locked, the gate doesn't matter.\r\nAny one who is careless about one thing, is likely to be careless about\r\nanother. Sometime he may forget to close that hole. I told you that we\r\nwould try for one of those hens to-morrow morning, but the more I think\r\nabout it, the more I think it will be wiser to visit that henhouse a\r\nfew nights before we run the risk of trying to catch a hen in broad\r\ndaylight. In fact, I am pretty sure I can make Farmer Brown's boy forget\r\nto close that gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Reddy eagerly.\r\n\r\nGranny grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cI'll try it first and tell you afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe Farmer Brown's boy closes the henhouse up just before jolly,\r\nround, red Mr. Sun goes to bed behind the Purple Hills, doesn't he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy nodded. Many times from a safe hiding-place he had hungrily\r\nwatched Farmer Brown's boy shut the biddies up. It was always just\r\nbefore the Black Shadows began to creep out from their hiding-places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny. The truth is, she KNEW so. There was\r\nnothing about that henhouse and what went on there that Granny didn't\r\nknow quite as well as Reddy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay right here this afternoon until I\r\nreturn. I'll see what I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go along,\xe2\x80\x9d begged Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny in such a decided tone that Reddy knew it would be\r\nof no use to tease. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes two can do what one cannot do alone, and\r\nsometimes one can do what two might spoil. Now we may as well take a nap\r\nuntil it is time for Mr. Sun to go to bed. Just you leave it to your old\r\nGranny to take care of the first of those ifs. For the other one we'll\r\nhave to trust to luck, but you know we are lucky sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this Granny curled up for a nap, and having nothing better to do,\r\nReddy followed her example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII: Farmer Brown's Boy Forgets To Close The Gate\r\n\r\n   How easy 't is to just forget\r\n   Until, alas, it is too late.\r\n   The most methodical of folks\r\n   Sometimes forget to shut the gate.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nFarmer Brown's Boy is not usually the forgetful kind. He is pretty good\r\nabout not forgetting. But Farmer Brown's boy isn't perfect by any means.\r\nHe does forget sometimes, and he is careless sometimes. He would be\r\na funny kind of boy otherwise. But take it day in and day out, he is\r\npretty thoughtful and careful.\r\n\r\nThe care of the hens is one of Farmer Brown's boy's duties. It is one of\r\nthose duties which most of the time is a pleasure. He likes the biddies,\r\nand he likes to take care of them. Every morning one of the first things\r\nhe does is to feed them and open the henhouse so that they can run in\r\nthe henyard if they want to. Every night he goes out just before dark,\r\ncollects the eggs and locks the henhouse so that no harm can come to the\r\nbiddies while they are asleep on their roosts. After the big snowstorm\r\nhe had shovelled a place in the henyard where the hens could come out\r\nand exercise and get a sun-bath when they wanted to, and in the very\r\nwarmest part of the clay they would do this. Always in the daytime he\r\ntook the greatest care to see that the henyard gate was fastened, for no\r\none knew better than he how bold Granny and Reddy Fox can be when they\r\nare very hungry, and in winter they are very apt to be very hungry most\r\nof the time. So he didn't intend to give them a chance to slip into that\r\nhenyard while the biddies were out, or to give the biddies a chance to\r\nstray outside where they might be still more easily caught.\r\n\r\nBut at night he sometimes left that gate open, as Granny Fox had found\r\nout. You see, he thought it didn't matter because the hens were locked\r\nin their warm house and so were safe, anyway.\r\n\r\nIt was just at dusk of the afternoon of the day when Granny and Reddy\r\nFox had talked over a plan to get one of those fat hens that Farmer\r\nBrown's boy collected the eggs and saw to it that the biddies had gone\r\nto roost for the night. He had just started to close the little sliding\r\ndoor across the hole through which the hens went in and out in the\r\ndaytime when Bowser the Hound began to make a great racket, as if\r\nterribly excited about something.\r\n\r\nFarmer Brown's boy gave the little sliding door a hasty push, picked up\r\nhis basket of eggs, locked the henhouse door and hurried out through the\r\ngate without stopping to close it. You see, he was in a hurry to find\r\nout what Bowser was making such a fuss about. Bowser was yelping and\r\nwhining and tugging at his chain, and it was plain to see that he was\r\nterribly eager to be set free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Bowser, old boy? Did you see something?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Farmer\r\nBrown's boy as he patted Bowser on the head. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't let you go, you\r\nknow, because you probably would go off hunting all night and come home\r\nin the morning all tired out and with sore feet. Whatever it was, I\r\nguess you've scared it out of a year's growth, old fellow, so we'll let\r\nit go at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBowser still tugged at his chain and whined, but after a little he\r\nquieted down. His master looked around behind the barn to see if he\r\ncould see what had so stirred up Bowser, but nothing was to be seen,\r\nand he returned, patted Bowser once more, and went into the house, never\r\nonce giving that open henyard gate another thought.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later old Granny Fox joined Reddy Fox, who was waiting on\r\nthe doorstep of their home. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all right, Reddy; that gate is open,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you do it, Granny?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Reddy eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cI let Bowser get a glimpse of me just\r\nas his master was locking up the henhouse. Bowser made a great fuss, and\r\nof course, Farmer Brown's boy hurried out to see what it was all about.\r\nHe was in too much of a hurry to close that gate, and afterwards he\r\nforgot all about it or else he thought it didn't matter. Of course, I\r\ndidn't let him get so much as a glimpse of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV: A Midnight Visit\r\n\r\n   By those who win 't is well agreed\r\n   He'll try and try who would succeed.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Reddy Fox as if time never had dragged so slowly as it\r\ndid this particular night while he and Granny Fox waited until Granny\r\nthought it safe to visit Farmer Brown's henhouse and see if by any\r\nchance there was a way of getting into it. Reddy tried not to hope too\r\nmuch. Granny had found a way to get the gate to the henyard left open,\r\nbut this would do them no good unless there was some way of getting\r\ninto the house, and this he very much doubted. But if there was a way he\r\nwanted to know it, and he was impatient to start.\r\n\r\nBut Granny was in no hurry. Not that she wasn't just as hungry for a fat\r\nhen as was Reddy, but she was too wise and clever and altogether too sly\r\nto run any risks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing gained by being in too much of a hurry, Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cand often a great deal is lost in that way. A fat hen will taste\r\njust as good a little later as it would now, and it will be foolish to\r\ngo up to Farmer Brown's until we are sure that everybody up there is\r\nasleep. But to ease your mind, I'll tell you what we will do; we'll go\r\nwhere we can see Farmer Brown's house and watch until the last light\r\nwinks out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they trotted to a point where they could see Farmer Brown's house,\r\nand there they sat down to watch. It seemed to Reddy that those lights\r\nnever would wink out. But at last they did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Granny!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, jumping to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, Reddy. Not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cWe've got to give folks time\r\nto get sound asleep. If we should get into that henhouse, those hens\r\nmight make a racket, and if anything like that is going to happen, we\r\nwant to be sure that Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's boy are asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was sound advice, and Reddy knew it. So with a groan he once more\r\nthrew himself down on the snow to wait. At last Granny arose, stretched,\r\nand looked up at the twinkling stars. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said she and led the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nUp back of the barn and around it they stole like two shadows and quite\r\nas noiselessly as shadows. They heard Bowser the Hound sighing in his\r\nsleep in his snug little house, and grinned at each other. Silently they\r\nstole over to the henyard. The gate was open, just as Granny had told\r\nReddy it would be. Across the henyard they trotted swiftly, straight to\r\nwhere more than once in the daytime they had seen the hens come out of\r\nthe house through a little hole. It was closed. Reddy had expected it\r\nwould be. Still, he was dreadfully disappointed. He gave it merely a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it wouldn't be any use,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a half whine.\r\n\r\nBut Granny paid no attention to him. She went close to the hole and\r\npushed gently against the little door that closed it. It didn't move.\r\nThen she noticed that at one edge there was a tiny crack. She tried to\r\npush her nose through, but the crack was too narrow. Then she tried a\r\npaw. A claw caught on the edge of the door, and it moved ever so little.\r\nThen Granny knew that the little door wasn't fastened. Granny stretched\r\nherself flat on the ground and went to work, first with one paw, then\r\nwith the other. By and by she caught her claws in it just right again,\r\nand it moved a wee bit more. No, most certainly that door wasn't\r\nfastened, and that crack was a little wider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you wasting your time there for?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Reddy crossly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'd better be off hunting if we would have anything to eat this\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranny said nothing but kept on working. She had discovered that this\r\nwas a sliding door. Presently the crack was wide enough for her to get\r\nher nose in. Then she pushed and twisted her head this way and that.\r\nThe little door slowly slid back, and when Reddy turned to speak to her\r\nagain, for he had had his back to her, she was nowhere to be seen. Reddy\r\njust gaped and gaped foolishly. There was no Granny Fox, but there was\r\na black hole where she had been working, and from it came the most\r\ndelicious smell,--the smell of fat hens! It seemed to Reddy that his\r\nstomach fairly flopped over with longing. He rubbed his eyes to be sure\r\nthat he was awake. Then in a twinkling he was inside that hole himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh-h-h, be still!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV: A Dinner For Two\r\n\r\n   Dark deeds are done in the stilly night,\r\n   And who shall say if they're wrong or right?\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nIt all depends on how you look at things. Of course, Granny and Reddy\r\nFox had no business to be in Farmer Brown's henhouse in the middle of\r\nthe night, or at any other time, for that matter. That is, they had no\r\nbusiness to be there, as Farmer Brown would look at the matter. He would\r\nhave called them two red thieves. Perhaps that is just what they were.\r\nBut looking at the matter as they did, I am not so sure about it. To\r\nGranny and Reddy Fox those hens were simply big, rather stupid birds,\r\nsplendid eating if they could be caught, and bound to be eaten by\r\nsomebody. The fact that they were in Farmer Brown's henhouse didn't make\r\nthem his any more than the fact that Mrs. Grouse was in a part of the\r\nGreen Forest owned by Farmer Brown made her his.\r\n\r\nYou see, among the little meadow and forest people there is no such\r\nthing as property rights, excepting in the matter of storehouses, and\r\nbecause these hens were alive, it didn't occur to Granny and Reddy that\r\nthe henhouse was a sort of storehouse. It would have made no difference\r\nif it had. Among the little people it is considered quite right to help\r\nyourself from another's storehouse if you are smart enough to find it\r\nand really need the food.\r\n\r\nBesides, Reddy and Granny knew that Fanner Brown and his boy would eat\r\nsome of those hens themselves, and they didn't begin to need them as\r\nReddy and Granny did. So as they looked at the matter, there was nothing\r\nwrong in being in that henhouse in the middle of the night. They were\r\nthere simply because they needed food very, very much, and food was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThey stared up at the roosts where the biddies were huddled together,\r\nfast asleep. They were too high up to be reached from the floor even\r\nwhen Reddy and Granny stood on their hind legs and stretched as far as\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe've got to wake them up and scare them so that some of the silly\r\nthings will fly down where we can catch them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reddy, licking his\r\nlips hungrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won't do at all!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would make a great racket\r\nand waken Bowser the Hound, and he would waken his master, and that is\r\njust what we mustn't do if we hope to ever get in here again. I thought\r\nyou had more sense, Reddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy looked a little shamefaced. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if we don't do that, how are we\r\ngoing to get them? We can't fly,\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stay right here where you are,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Granny, \xe2\x80\x9cand take care that\r\nyou don't make a sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Granny jumped lightly to a little shelf that ran along in front of\r\nthe nesting boxes. From this she could reach the lower roost on which\r\nfour fat hens were asleep. Very gently she pushed her head in between\r\ntwo of these and crowded them apart. Sleepily they protested and moved\r\nalong a little. Granny continued to crowd them. At last one of them\r\nstretched out her head to see who was crowding so. Like a flash Granny\r\nseized that head, and biddy never knew what had wakened her, nor did she\r\nhave a chance to waken the others.\r\n\r\nDropping this hen at Reddy's feet, Granny crowded another until she did\r\nthe same thing, and just the same thing happened once more. Then Granny\r\njumped lightly down, picked up one of the hens by the neck, slung the\r\nbody over her shoulder, and told Reddy to do the same with the other and\r\nstart for home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren't you going to get any more while we have the chance?\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled\r\nReddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cWe've got a dinner for two, and\r\nso far no one is any the wiser. Perhaps these two won't be missed, and\r\nwe'll have a chance to get some more another night. Now come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was plain common sense, and Reddy knew it, so without another word\r\nhe followed old Granny Fox out by the way they had entered, and then\r\nhome to the best dinner he had had for a long long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI: Farmer Brown's Boy Sets A Trap\r\n\r\n   The trouble is that troubles are,\r\n   More frequently than not,\r\n   Brought on by naught but carelessness;\r\n   By some one who forgot.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nGranny Fox had hoped that those two hens she and Reddy had stolen from\r\nFarmer Brown's henhouse would not be missed, but they were. They were\r\nmissed the very first thing the next morning when Farmer Brown's boy\r\nwent to feed the biddies. He discovered right away that the little\r\nsliding door which should have closed the opening through which the hens\r\nwent in and out of the house was open, and then he remembered that\r\nhe had left the henyard gate open the night before. Carefully Farmer\r\nBrown's boy examined the hole with the sliding door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he presently, and held up two red hairs which he had found on\r\nthe edge of the door. \xe2\x80\x9cHa! I thought as much. I was careless last night\r\nand didn't fasten this door, and I left the gate open. Reddy Fox has\r\nbeen here, and now I know what has become of those two hens. I suppose\r\nit serves me right for my carelessness, and I suppose if the truth were\r\nknown, those hens were of more real good to him than they ever could\r\nhave been to me, because the poor fellow must be having pretty hard work\r\nto get a living these hard winter days. Still, I can't have him stealing\r\nany more. That would never do at all. If I shut them up every night and\r\nam not careless, he can't get them. But accidents will happen, and I\r\nmight do just as I did last night--think I had locked up when I hadn't.\r\nI don't like to set a trap for Reddy, but I must teach the rascal a\r\nlesson. If I don't, he will get so bold that those chickens won't be\r\nsafe even in broad daylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow at just that very time over in their home, Granny and Reddy Fox were\r\ntalking over plans for the future, and shrewd old Granny was pointing\r\nout to Reddy how necessary it was that they should keep away from that\r\nhenyard for some time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe've had a good dinner, a splendid dinner, and\r\nif we are smart enough we may be able to get more good dinners where\r\nthis one came from,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we certainly won't if we are too\r\ngreedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don't believe Farmer Brown's boy has missed those two chickens,\r\nand I don't see any reason at all why we shouldn't go back there\r\nto-night and get two more if he is stupid enough to leave that gate and\r\nlittle door open,\xe2\x80\x9d whined Reddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he hasn't missed those two, but if we should take two more he\r\ncertainly would miss them, and he would guess what had become of them,\r\nand that might get us into no end of trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Granny. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\nnot starving now, and the best thing for us to do is to keep away from\r\nthat henhouse until we can't get anything to eat anywhere else, Now you\r\nmind what I tell you, Reddy, and don't you dare go near there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy promised, and so it came about that Farmer Brown's boy hunted up\r\na trap all for nothing so far as Reddy and Granny were concerned. Very\r\ncarefully he bound strips of cloth around the jaws of the trap, for\r\nhe couldn't bear to think of those cruel jaws cutting into the leg\r\nof Reddy, should he happen to get caught. You see, Farmer Brown's boy\r\ndidn't intend to kill Reddy if he should catch him, but to make him a\r\nprisoner for a while and so keep him out of mischief. That night he hid\r\nthe trap very cunningly just inside the henhouse where any one creeping\r\nthrough that little hole made for the hens to go in and out would be\r\nsure to step in it. Then he purposely left the little sliding door open\r\npart way as if it had been forgotten, and he also left the henyard gate\r\nopen just as he had done the night before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Master Reddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, talking to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI rather think\r\nthat you are going to get into trouble before morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd doubtless Reddy would have done just that thing but for the wisdom\r\nof sly old Granny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII: Prickly Porky Takes A Sun Bath\r\n\r\n   Danger comes when least expected;\r\n   'T is often near when not expected.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nThe long hard winter had passed, and Spring had come. Prickly Porky\r\nthe Porcupine came down from a tall poplar-tree and slowly stretched\r\nhimself. He was tired of eating. He was tired of swinging in the\r\ntree-top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I'll have a sun-bath,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prickly Porky, and lazily walked\r\ntoward the edge of the Green Forest in search of a place where the sun\r\nlay warm and bright.\r\n\r\nNow Prickly Porky's stomach was very, very full. He was fat and\r\nnaturally lazy, so when he came to the doorstep of an old house just on\r\nthe edge of the Green Forest he sat down to rest. It was sunny and warm\r\nthere, and the longer he sat the less like moving he felt. He looked\r\nabout him with his dull eyes and grunted to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a deserted house. Nobody lives here, and I guess nobody'll care if\r\nI take a nap right here on the doorstep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prickly Porky to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don't care if they do,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, for Prickly Porky the Porcupine\r\nwas afraid of nobody and nothing.\r\n\r\nSo Prickly Porky made himself as comfortable as possible, yawned once or\r\ntwice, tried to wink at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, who was winking and\r\nsmiling down at him and then fell fast asleep right on the doorstep of\r\nthe old house.\r\n\r\nNow the old house had been deserted. No one had lived in it for a long,\r\nlong time, a very long time indeed. But it happened that, the night\r\nbefore, old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox had had to move out of their nice\r\nhome on the edge of the Green Meadows because Farmer Brown's boy had\r\nfound it. Reddy was very stiff and sore, for he had been shot by a\r\nhunter. He was so sore he could hardly walk, and could not go very far.\r\nSo old Granny Fox had led him to the old deserted house and put him to\r\nbed in that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will think of looking for us here, for every one knows that no\r\none lives here,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Granny Fox, as she made Reddy as comfortable\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was daylight, Granny Fox slipped out to watch for Farmer\r\nBrown's boy, for she felt sure that he would come back to the house they\r\nhad left, and sure enough he did. He brought a spade and dug the house\r\nopen, and all the time old Granny Fox was watching him from behind a\r\nfence corner and laughing to think that she had been smart enough to\r\nmove in the night.\r\n\r\nBut Reddy Fox didn't know anything about this. He was so tired that he\r\nslept and slept and slept. It was the middle of the morning when finally\r\nhe awoke. He yawned and stretched, and when he stretched he groaned\r\nbecause he was so stiff and sore. Then he hobbled up toward the doorway\r\nto see if old Granny Fox had left any breakfast outside for him.\r\n\r\nIt was dark, very dark. Reddy was puzzled. Could it be that he had\r\ngotten up before daylight--that he hadn't slept as long as he thought?\r\nPerhaps he had slept the whole day through, and it was night again. My,\r\nhow hungry he was!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Granny has caught a fine, fat chicken for me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Reddy,\r\nand his mouth watered.\r\n\r\nJust then he ran bump into something. \xe2\x80\x9cWow!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Reddy Fox, and\r\nclapped both hands to his nose. Something was sticking into it. It was\r\none of the sharp little spears that Prickly Porky hides in his coat.\r\nReddy Fox knew then why the old house was so dark. Prickly Porky was\r\nblocking up the doorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII: Prickly Porky Enjoys Himself\r\n\r\n   A boasting tongue, as sure as fate,\r\n   Will trip its owner soon or late.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nPrickly Porky the Porcupine was enjoying himself. There was no doubt\r\nabout that. He was stretched across the doorway of that old house, the\r\nvery house in which old Granny Fox had been born. When he had lain down\r\non the doorstep for a nap and sun-bath, he had thought that the old\r\nhouse was still deserted. Then he had fallen asleep, only to be wakened\r\nby Reddy Fox, who bad been asleep in the old house and who couldn't get\r\nout because Prickly Porky was in the way.\r\n\r\nNow Prickly Porky does not love Reddy Fox, and the more Reddy begged and\r\nscolded and called him names, the more Prickly Porky chuckled. It was\r\nsuch a good joke to think that he had trapped Reddy Fox, and he made up\r\nhis mind that he would keep Reddy in there a long time just to tease him\r\nand make him uncomfortable. You see Prickly Porky remembered how often\r\nReddy Fox played mean tricks on little meadow and forest folks who are\r\nsmaller and weaker than himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will do him good. It certainly will do him good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prickly\r\nPorky, and rattled the thousand little spears hidden in his long coat,\r\nfor he knew that the very sound of them would make Reddy Fox shiver with\r\nfright.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Prickly Porky pricked up his funny little short ears. He heard\r\nthe deep voice of Bowser the Hound, and it was coming nearer and nearer.\r\nPrickly Porky chuckled again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess Mr. Bowser is going to have a surprise; I certainly think he\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prickly Porky as he made all the thousand little spears stand\r\nout from his long coat till he looked like a funny great chestnut burr.\r\n\r\nBowser the Hound did have a surprise. He was hunting Reddy Fox, and he\r\nalmost ran into Prickly Porky before he saw him. The very sight of those\r\nthousand little spears sent little cold chills chasing each other down\r\nBowser's backbone clear to the tip of his tail, for he remembered how he\r\nhad gotten some of them in his lips and mouth once upon a time, and\r\nhow it had hurt to have them pulled out. Ever since then he had had the\r\ngreatest respect for Prickly Porky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWow!\xe2\x80\x9d yelped Bowser the Hound, stopping short. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\r\nPrickly Porky, I beg your pardon, I didn't know you were taking a nap\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the time Bowser the Hound was backing away as fast as he could. Then\r\nhe turned around, put his tail between his legs and actually ran away.\r\n\r\nSlowly Prickly Porky unrolled, and his little eyes twinkled as he\r\nwatched Bowser the Hound run away.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cBowser's very big and strong;\r\n   His voice is deep; his legs are long;\r\n  His bark scares some almost to death.\r\n   But as for me he wastes his breath;\r\n  I just roll up and shake my spears\r\n   And Bowser is the one who fears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo said Prickly Porky, and laughed aloud. Just then he heard a light\r\nfootstep and turned to see who was coming. It was old Granny Fox. She\r\nhad seen Bowser run away, and now she was anxious to find out if Reddy\r\nFox were safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny Fox, taking care not to come too near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prickly Porky, hiding a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm very tired and would like to go inside my house; had you just as\r\nsoon move?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Granny Fox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Prickly Porky, \xe2\x80\x9cis this your house? I thought you lived\r\nover on the Green Meadows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, but I've moved. Please let me in,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Granny Fox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly. Don't mind me, Granny Fox. Step right over me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Prickly Porky, and smiled once more, and at the same time rattled\r\nhis little spears.\r\n\r\nInstead of stepping over him, Granny Fox backed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX: The New Home In The Old Pasture\r\n\r\n   Who keeps a watch upon his toes\r\n   Need never fear he'll bump his nose.\r\n     --Old Granny Fox.\r\n\r\nNow there is nothing like being shut in alone in the dark to make one\r\nthink. A voice inside of Reddy began to whisper to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you hadn't\r\ntried to be smart and show off you wouldn't have brought all this\r\ntrouble on yourself and Old Granny Fox,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Reddy right out loud, forgetting that it was only a\r\nsmall voice inside of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prickly Porky. He was still keeping Reddy in\r\nand Granny out and he had overheard what Reddy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is none of your business!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Reddy.\r\n\r\nReddy could hear Prickly Porky chuckle. Then Prickly Porky repeated as\r\nif to himself in a queer cracked voice the following:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cRudeness never, never pays,\r\n  Nor is there gain in saucy ways.\r\n  It's always best to be polite\r\n  And ne'er give way to ugly spite.\r\n  If that's the way you feel inside\r\n  You'd better all such feelings hide;\r\n  For he must smile who hopes to win,\r\n  And he who loses best will grin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy pretended that he hadn't heard. Prickly Porky continued to chuckle\r\nfor a while and finally Reddy fell asleep. When he awoke it was to find\r\nthat Prickly Porky had left and old Granny Fox had brought him something\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as Reddy Fox was able to travel he and Granny had moved\r\nto the Old Pasture. The Old Pasture is very different from the Green\r\nMeadows or the Green Forest. Yes, indeed, it is very, very different.\r\nReddy Fox thought so. And Reddy didn't like the change,--not a bit. All\r\nabout were great rocks, and around and over them grew bushes and\r\nyoung trees and bull-briars with long ugly thorns, and blackberry and\r\nraspberry canes that seemed to have a million little hooked hands,\r\nreaching to catch in and tear his red coat and to scratch his face and\r\nhands. There were little open places where wild-eyed young cattle fed\r\non the short grass. They had made many little paths all crisscross among\r\nthe bushes, and when you tried to follow one of these paths you never\r\ncould tell where you were coming out.\r\n\r\nNo, Reddy Fox did not like the Old Pasture at all. There was no long,\r\nsoft green grass to lie down in. And it was lonesome up there. He missed\r\nthe little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. There was\r\nno one to bully and tease. And it was such a long, long way from Farmer\r\nBrown's henyard that old Granny Fox wouldn't even try to bring him a fat\r\nhen. At least, that's what she told Reddy.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, wise old Granny Fox knew that the very best thing she\r\ncould do was to stay away from Farmer Brown's for a long time. She knew\r\nthat Reddy couldn't go down there, because he was still too lame and\r\nsore to travel such a long way, and she hoped that by the time Reddy\r\nwas well enough to go, he would have learned better than to do such\r\na foolish thing as to try to show off by stealing a chicken in broad\r\ndaylight, as he had when he brought all this trouble on them.\r\n\r\nDown on the Green Meadows, the home of Granny and Reddy Fox had been on\r\na little knoll, which you know is a little low hill, right where they\r\ncould sit on their doorstep and look all over the Green Meadows. It had\r\nbeen very, very beautiful down there. They had made lovely little paths\r\nthrough the tall green meadow grass, and the buttercups and daisies had\r\ngrown close up to their very doorstep. But up here in the Old Pasture\r\nGranny Fox had chosen the thickest clump of bushes and young trees she\r\ncould find, and in the middle was a great pile of rocks. Way in among\r\nthese rocks Granny Fox had dug their new house. It was right down under\r\nthe rocks. Even in the middle of the day jolly, round, red Mr. Sun could\r\nhardly find it with a few of his long, bright beams. All the rest of the\r\ntime it was dark and gloomy there.\r\n\r\nNo, Reddy Fox didn't like his new home at all, but when he said so old\r\nGranny Fox boxed his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's your own fault that we've got to live here now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's\r\nthe only place where we are safe. Farmer Brown's boy never will find\r\nthis home, and even if he did he couldn't dig into it as he did into our\r\nold home on the Green Meadows. Here we are, and here we've got to stay,\r\nall because a foolish little Fox thought himself smarter than anybody\r\nelse and tried to show off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReddy hung his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't care!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, which was very, very\r\nfoolish, because, you know, he did care a very great deal.\r\n\r\nAnd here we will leave wise Old Granny Fox and Reddy, safe, even if\r\nthey do not like their new home. You see, Lightfoot the Deer is getting\r\njealous. He thinks there should be some books about the people of the\r\nGreen Forest, and that the first one should be about him. And because we\r\nall love Lightfoot the Deer, the very next book is to bear his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Old Granny Fox, by Thornton W.
