And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\r\n\r\n1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light\r\nfrom the darkness.\r\n\r\n1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.\r\nAnd the evening and the morning were the first day.\r\n\r\n1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,\r\nand let it divide the waters from the waters.\r\n\r\n1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were\r\nunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:\r\nand it was so.\r\n\r\n1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the\r\nmorning were the second day.\r\n\r\n1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together\r\nunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\r\n\r\n1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of\r\nthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding\r\nseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is\r\nin itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\r\n\r\n1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after\r\nhis kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after\r\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\r\n\r\n1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven\r\nto divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for\r\nseasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in\r\nthe firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was\r\nso.\r\n\r\n1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,\r\nand the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\r\n\r\n1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light\r\nupon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and\r\nto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\r\n\r\n1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving\r\ncreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the\r\nopen firmament of heaven.\r\n\r\n1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that\r\nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,\r\nand every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill\r\nthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\r\n\r\n1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\r\n\r\n1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after\r\nhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his\r\nkind: and it was so.\r\n\r\n1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle\r\nafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after\r\nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\r\n\r\n1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:\r\nand let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl\r\nof the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over\r\nevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\r\n\r\n1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created\r\nhe him; male and female created he them.\r\n\r\n1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\r\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion\r\nover the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every\r\nliving thing that moveth upon the earth.\r\n\r\n1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,\r\nwhich is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which\r\nis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\r\n\r\n1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,\r\nand to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is\r\nlife, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\r\n\r\n1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was\r\nvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\r\n\r\n2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and\r\nhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\r\n\r\n2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that\r\nin it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.\r\n\r\n2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when\r\nthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the\r\nheavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,\r\nand every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not\r\ncaused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole\r\nface of the ground.\r\n\r\n2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\r\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he\r\nput the man whom he had formed.\r\n\r\n2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is\r\npleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the\r\nmidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\r\n\r\n2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence\r\nit was parted, and became into four heads.\r\n\r\n2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the\r\nwhole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that\r\nland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.\r\n\r\n2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that\r\ncompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which\r\ngoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.\r\n\r\n2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of\r\nEden to dress it and to keep it.\r\n\r\n2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the\r\ngarden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge\r\nof good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou\r\neatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\r\n\r\n2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be\r\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\r\n\r\n2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the\r\nfield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see\r\nwhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living\r\ncreature, that was the name thereof.\r\n\r\n2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,\r\nand to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an\r\nhelp meet for him.\r\n\r\n2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he\r\nslept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead\r\nthereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made\r\nhe a woman, and brought her unto the man.\r\n\r\n2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my\r\nflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\r\n\r\n2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall\r\ncleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\r\n\r\n2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which\r\nthe LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,\r\nYe shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said\r\nunto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:\r\n3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\r\nGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest\r\nye die.\r\n\r\n3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5\r\nFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall\r\nbe opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\r\n\r\n3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that\r\nit was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one\r\nwise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto\r\nher husband with her; and he did eat.\r\n\r\n3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they\r\nwere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves\r\naprons.\r\n\r\n3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in\r\nthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the\r\npresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.\r\n\r\n3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art\r\nthou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was\r\nafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\r\n\r\n3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten\r\nof the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\r\n3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she\r\ngave me of the tree, and I did eat.\r\n\r\n3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast\r\ndone? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\r\n\r\n3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done\r\nthis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the\r\nfield; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the\r\ndays of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the\r\nwoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,\r\nand thou shalt bruise his heel.\r\n\r\n3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\r\nthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy\r\ndesire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\r\n\r\n3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice\r\nof thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,\r\nsaying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;\r\nin sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns\r\nalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the\r\nherb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,\r\ntill thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for\r\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\r\n\r\n3:20 And Adam called his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name Eve; because she was the mother\r\nof all living.\r\n\r\n3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of\r\nskins, and clothed them.\r\n\r\n3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to\r\nknow good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also\r\nof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the\r\nLORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground\r\nfrom whence he was taken.\r\n\r\n3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden\r\nof Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep\r\nthe way of the tree of life.\r\n\r\n4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and\r\nsaid, I have gotten a man from the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of\r\nsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\r\n\r\n4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the\r\nfruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of\r\nthe fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his\r\noffering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.\r\nAnd Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.\r\n\r\n4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy\r\ncountenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be\r\naccepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto\r\nthee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\r\n\r\n4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when\r\nthey were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,\r\nand slew him.\r\n\r\n4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he\r\nsaid, I know not: Am I my brother\xe2\x80\x99s keeper?  4:10 And he said, What\r\nhast thou done? the voice of thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s blood crieth unto me from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\r\nmouth to receive thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou\r\ntillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her\r\nstrength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\r\n\r\n4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the\r\nearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and\r\na vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one\r\nthat findeth me shall slay me.\r\n\r\n4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,\r\nvengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark\r\nupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.\r\n\r\n4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the\r\nland of Nod, on the east of Eden.\r\n\r\n4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he\r\nbuilded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his\r\nson, Enoch.\r\n\r\n4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and\r\nMehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\r\n\r\n4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,\r\nand the name of the other Zillah.\r\n\r\n4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,\r\nand of such as have cattle.\r\n\r\n4:21 And his brother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such\r\nas handle the harp and organ.\r\n\r\n4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every\r\nartificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\r\n\r\n4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;\r\nye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to\r\nmy wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\r\n\r\n4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and\r\nsevenfold.\r\n\r\n4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his\r\nname Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead\r\nof Abel, whom Cain slew.\r\n\r\n4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his\r\nname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God\r\ncreated man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and female\r\ncreated he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the\r\nday when they were created.\r\n\r\n5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his\r\nown likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 And\r\nthe days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years:\r\nand he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam lived\r\nwere nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And\r\nSeth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and\r\nbegat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were nine\r\nhundred and twelve years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived\r\nafter he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons\r\nand daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and\r\nfive years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And\r\nCainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,\r\nand begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan were\r\nnine hundred and ten years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16\r\nAnd Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty\r\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days of\r\nMahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat\r\nEnoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,\r\nand begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were nine\r\nhundred sixty and two years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22\r\nAnd Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred\r\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enoch\r\nwere three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked with\r\nGod: and he was not; for God took him.\r\n\r\n5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat\r\nLamech.\r\n\r\n5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty\r\nand two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days of\r\nMethuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a\r\nson: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort\r\nus concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground\r\nwhich the LORD hath cursed.\r\n\r\n5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five\r\nyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamech\r\nwere seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.\r\n\r\n5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,\r\nand Japheth.\r\n\r\n6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the\r\nearth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God saw\r\nthe daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of\r\nall which they chose.\r\n\r\n6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for\r\nthat he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,\r\nwhen the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare\r\nchildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of\r\nrenown.\r\n\r\n6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and\r\nthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\n6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it\r\ngrieved him at his heart.\r\n\r\n6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the\r\nface of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and\r\nthe fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\r\n\r\n6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect\r\nin his generations, and Noah walked with God.\r\n\r\n6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\r\n\r\n6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled\r\nwith violence.\r\n\r\n6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for\r\nall flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\r\n\r\n6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;\r\nfor the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I\r\nwill destroy them with the earth.\r\n\r\n6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the\r\nark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\r\n\r\n6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length\r\nof the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty\r\ncubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\r\n\r\n6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou\r\nfinish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side\r\nthereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\r\n\r\n6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the\r\nearth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under\r\nheaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\r\n\r\n6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come\r\ninto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons\xe2\x80\x99 wives\r\nwith thee.\r\n\r\n6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt\r\nthou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be\r\nmale and female.\r\n\r\n6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of\r\nevery creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort\r\nshall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\r\n\r\n6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt\r\ngather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\r\n\r\n6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the\r\nark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.\r\n\r\n7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male\r\nand his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and\r\nhis female.\r\n\r\n7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to\r\nkeep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.\r\n\r\n7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth\r\nforty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have\r\nmade will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.\r\n\r\n7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\n7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99 wives\r\nwith him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\r\n\r\n7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,\r\nand of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in two\r\nand two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had\r\ncommanded Noah.\r\n\r\n7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the\r\nflood were upon the earth.\r\n\r\n7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah\xe2\x80\x99s life, in the second month,\r\nthe seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains\r\nof the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\r\n\r\n7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\r\n\r\n7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,\r\nthe sons of Noah, and Noah\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and the three wives of his sons\r\nwith them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,\r\nand all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that\r\ncreepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,\r\nevery bird of every sort.\r\n\r\n7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all\r\nflesh, wherein is the breath of life.\r\n\r\n7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as\r\nGod had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.\r\n\r\n7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters\r\nincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\r\n\r\n7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the\r\nearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.\r\n\r\n7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the\r\nhigh hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.\r\n\r\n7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains\r\nwere covered.\r\n\r\n7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and\r\nof cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth\r\nupon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the\r\nbreath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.\r\n\r\n7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face\r\nof the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the\r\nfowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah\r\nonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\r\n\r\n7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the\r\ncattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over\r\nthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deep\r\nand the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was\r\nrestrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earth\r\ncontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the\r\nwaters were abated.\r\n\r\n8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of\r\nthe month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\r\n\r\n8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the\r\ntenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the\r\nmountains seen.\r\n\r\n8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the\r\nwindow of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,\r\nwhich went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were\r\nabated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no rest\r\nfor the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for\r\nthe waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his\r\nhand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.\r\n\r\n8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the\r\ndove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;\r\nand, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that\r\nthe waters were abated from off the earth.\r\n\r\n8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;\r\nwhich returned not again unto him any more.\r\n\r\n8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the\r\nfirst month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from\r\noff the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,\r\nand, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\r\n\r\n8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the\r\nmonth, was the earth dried.\r\n\r\n8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,\r\nand thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons\xe2\x80\x99 wives with thee.\r\n\r\n8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of\r\nall flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing\r\nthat creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the\r\nearth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.\r\n\r\n8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every\r\nfowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went\r\nforth out of the ark.\r\n\r\n8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean\r\nbeast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\n8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his\r\nheart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man\xe2\x80\x99s sake; for\r\nthe imagination of man\xe2\x80\x99s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I\r\nagain smite any more every thing living, as I have done.\r\n\r\n8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and\r\nheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\r\n\r\n9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be\r\nfruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\r\n\r\n9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast\r\nof the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth\r\nupon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are\r\nthey delivered.\r\n\r\n9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the\r\ngreen herb have I given you all things.\r\n\r\n9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall\r\nye not eat.\r\n\r\n9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of\r\nevery beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of\r\nevery man\xe2\x80\x99s brother will I require the life of man.\r\n\r\n9:6 Whoso sheddeth man\xe2\x80\x99s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in\r\nthe image of God made he man.\r\n\r\n9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in\r\nthe earth, and multiply therein.\r\n\r\n9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And\r\nI, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after\r\nyou; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the\r\nfowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from\r\nall that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.\r\n\r\n9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all\r\nflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall\r\nthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth.\r\n\r\n9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make\r\nbetween me and you and every living creature that is with you, for\r\nperpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall\r\nbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.\r\n\r\n9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,\r\nthat the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember my\r\ncovenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all\r\nflesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that\r\nI may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living\r\ncreature of all flesh that is upon the earth.\r\n\r\n9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which\r\nI have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\r\n\r\n9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and\r\nHam, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.\r\n\r\n9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth\r\noverspread.\r\n\r\n9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:\r\n9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered\r\nwithin his tent.\r\n\r\n9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,\r\nand told his two brethren without.\r\n\r\n9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their\r\nshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their\r\nfather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnakedness.\r\n\r\n9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had\r\ndone unto him.\r\n\r\n9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be\r\nunto his brethren.\r\n\r\n9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be\r\nhis servant.\r\n\r\n9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of\r\nShem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\r\n\r\n9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\n9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and\r\nJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.\r\n\r\n10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\r\nTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\r\n\r\n10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\r\n\r\n10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and\r\nDodanim.\r\n\r\n10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;\r\nevery one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\r\n\r\n10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.\r\n\r\n10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,\r\nand Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.\r\n\r\n10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\r\n\r\n10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,\r\nEven as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.\r\n\r\n10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and\r\nAccad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\r\n\r\n10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the\r\ncity Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:\r\nthe same is a great city.\r\n\r\n10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,\r\n10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and\r\nCaphtorim.\r\n\r\n10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the\r\nJebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,\r\nand the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and the\r\nZemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the\r\nCanaanites spread abroad.\r\n\r\n10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest\r\nto Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and\r\nAdmah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.\r\n\r\n10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their\r\ntongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\r\n\r\n10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the\r\nbrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.\r\n\r\n10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,\r\nand Aram.\r\n\r\n10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.\r\n\r\n10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.\r\n\r\n10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for\r\nin his days was the earth divided; and his brother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Joktan.\r\n\r\n10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and\r\nJerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, and\r\nAbimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these\r\nwere the sons of Joktan.\r\n\r\n10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a\r\nmount of the east.\r\n\r\n10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their\r\ntongues, in their lands, after their nations.\r\n\r\n10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their\r\ngenerations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided\r\nin the earth after the flood.\r\n\r\n11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\r\n\r\n11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they\r\nfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\r\n\r\n11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn\r\nthem thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for\r\nmorter.\r\n\r\n11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose\r\ntop may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be\r\nscattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the\r\nchildren of men builded.\r\n\r\n11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all\r\none language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be\r\nrestrained from them, which they have imagined to do.\r\n\r\n11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that\r\nthey may not understand one another\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\r\n\r\n11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of\r\nall the earth: and they left off to build the city.\r\n\r\n11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did\r\nthere confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the\r\nLORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\r\n\r\n11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years\r\nold, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shem\r\nlived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13\r\nAnd Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,\r\nand begat sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah\r\nlived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons\r\nand daughters.\r\n\r\n11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And\r\nEber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and\r\nbegat sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg\r\nlived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons\r\nand daughters.\r\n\r\n11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And\r\nReu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat\r\nsons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug\r\nlived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25\r\nAnd Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,\r\nand begat sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and\r\nHaran.\r\n\r\n11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,\r\nNahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.\r\n\r\n11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his\r\nnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.\r\n\r\n11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nwas Sarai; and the name of Nahor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Milcah, the daughter of\r\nHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.\r\n\r\n11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.\r\n\r\n11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram\xe2\x80\x99s wife; and they\r\nwent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of\r\nCanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.\r\n\r\n11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah\r\ndied in Haran.\r\n\r\n12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,\r\nand from thy kindred, and from thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house, unto a land that I\r\nwill shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I\r\nwill bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a\r\nblessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him\r\nthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be\r\nblessed.\r\n\r\n12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went\r\nwith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed\r\nout of Haran.\r\n\r\n12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother\xe2\x80\x99s son, and all\r\ntheir substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had\r\ngotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;\r\nand into the land of Canaan they came.\r\n\r\n12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto\r\nthe plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.\r\n\r\n12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I\r\ngive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who\r\nappeared unto him.\r\n\r\n12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,\r\nand pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:\r\nand there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\r\n\r\n12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into\r\nEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.\r\n\r\n12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,\r\nthat he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a\r\nfair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when\r\nthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:\r\nand they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.\r\n\r\n12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with\r\nme for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\r\n\r\n12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the\r\nEgyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\r\n\r\n12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before\r\nPharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and\r\noxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,\r\nand camels.\r\n\r\n12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues\r\nbecause of Sarai Abram\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast\r\ndone unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19\r\nWhy saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to\r\nwife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\r\n\r\n12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him\r\naway, and his wife, and all that he had.\r\n\r\n13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he\r\nhad, and Lot with him, into the south.\r\n\r\n13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\r\n\r\n13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto\r\nthe place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and\r\nHai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the\r\nfirst: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and\r\ntents.\r\n\r\n13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell\r\ntogether: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram\xe2\x80\x99s cattle and\r\nthe herdmen of Lot\xe2\x80\x99s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite\r\ndwelled then in the land.\r\n\r\n13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,\r\nbetween me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,\r\nfrom me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;\r\nor if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\r\n\r\n13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,\r\nthat it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,\r\nas thou comest unto Zoar.\r\n\r\n13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed\r\neast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\r\n\r\n13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the\r\ncities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\r\n\r\n13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from\r\nhim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art\r\nnorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For all\r\nthe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for\r\never.\r\n\r\n13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a\r\nman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\n13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the\r\nbreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\r\n\r\n13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of\r\nMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,\r\nArioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of\r\nnations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with\r\nBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of\r\nZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\r\n\r\n14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is\r\nthe salt sea.\r\n\r\n14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year\r\nthey rebelled.\r\n\r\n14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that\r\nwere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the\r\nZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And the\r\nHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\r\n\r\n14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and\r\nsmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that\r\ndwelt in Hazezontamar.\r\n\r\n14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,\r\nand the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela\r\n(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of\r\nSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king\r\nof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;\r\nfour kings with five.\r\n\r\n14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of\r\nSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled\r\nto the mountain.\r\n\r\n14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their\r\nvictuals, and went their way.\r\n\r\n14:12 And they took Lot, Abram\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x99s son, who dwelt in Sodom,\r\nand his goods, and departed.\r\n\r\n14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;\r\nfor he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and\r\nbrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.\r\n\r\n14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he\r\narmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and\r\neighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.\r\n\r\n14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by\r\nnight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the\r\nleft hand of Damascus.\r\n\r\n14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his\r\nbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.\r\n\r\n14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from\r\nthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at\r\nthe valley of Shaveh, which is the king\xe2\x80\x99s dale.\r\n\r\n14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and\r\nhe was the priest of the most high God.\r\n\r\n14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high\r\nGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most high\r\nGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him\r\ntithes of all.\r\n\r\n14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and\r\ntake the goods to thyself.\r\n\r\n14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand\r\nunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,\r\n14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and\r\nthat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,\r\nI have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men have\r\neaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,\r\nand Mamre; let them take their portion.\r\n\r\n15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a\r\nvision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding\r\ngreat reward.\r\n\r\n15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go\r\nchildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?\r\n15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,\r\none born in my house is mine heir.\r\n\r\n15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This\r\nshall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own\r\nbowels shall be thine heir.\r\n\r\n15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward\r\nheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he\r\nsaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.\r\n\r\n15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur\r\nof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\r\n\r\n15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit\r\nit?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,\r\nand a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a\r\nturtledove, and a young pigeon.\r\n\r\n15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,\r\nand laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\r\n\r\n15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them\r\naway.\r\n\r\n15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;\r\nand, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\r\n\r\n15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be\r\na stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and\r\nthey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that\r\nnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they\r\ncome out with great substance.\r\n\r\n15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried\r\nin a good old age.\r\n\r\n15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for\r\nthe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\r\n\r\n15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was\r\ndark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between\r\nthose pieces.\r\n\r\n15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,\r\nUnto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the\r\ngreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and the\r\nKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and the\r\nPerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and the\r\nCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\r\n\r\n16:1 Now Sarai Abram\xe2\x80\x99s wife bare him no children: and she had an\r\nhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\r\n\r\n16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained\r\nme from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may\r\nobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\r\n\r\n16:3 And Sarai Abram\xe2\x80\x99s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after\r\nAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her\r\nhusband Abram to be his wife.\r\n\r\n16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw\r\nthat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\r\n\r\n16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my\r\nmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was\r\ndespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.\r\n\r\n16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do\r\nto her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she\r\nfled from her face.\r\n\r\n16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the\r\nwilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\r\n\r\n16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai\xe2\x80\x99s maid, whence camest thou? and whither\r\nwilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\r\n\r\n16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,\r\nand submit thyself under her hands.\r\n\r\n16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy\r\nseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\r\n\r\n16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with\r\nchild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because\r\nthe LORD hath heard thy affliction.\r\n\r\n16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,\r\nand every man\xe2\x80\x99s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence\r\nof all his brethren.\r\n\r\n16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou\r\nGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that\r\nseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,\r\nit is between Kadesh and Bered.\r\n\r\n16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nwhich Hagar bare, Ishmael.\r\n\r\n16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare\r\nIshmael to Abram.\r\n\r\n17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared\r\nto Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,\r\nand be thou perfect.\r\n\r\n17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will\r\nmultiply thee exceedingly.\r\n\r\n17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4\r\nAs for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a\r\nfather of many nations.\r\n\r\n17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name\r\nshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\r\n\r\n17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations\r\nof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\r\n\r\n17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed\r\nafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a\r\nGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\r\n\r\n17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land\r\nwherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an\r\neverlasting possession; and I will be their God.\r\n\r\n17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,\r\nthou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.\r\n\r\n17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and\r\nthy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.\r\n\r\n17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall\r\nbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\r\n\r\n17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,\r\nevery man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or\r\nbought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.\r\n\r\n17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy\r\nmoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your\r\nflesh for an everlasting covenant.\r\n\r\n17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is\r\nnot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath\r\nbroken my covenant.\r\n\r\n17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not\r\ncall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\r\n\r\n17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I\r\nwill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people\r\nshall be of her.\r\n\r\n17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his\r\nheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?\r\nand shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abraham\r\nsaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And God\r\nsaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call\r\nhis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an\r\neverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.\r\n\r\n17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed\r\nhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;\r\ntwelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.\r\n\r\n17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall\r\nbear unto thee at this set time in the next year.\r\n\r\n17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.\r\n\r\n17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his\r\nhouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the\r\nmen of Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in\r\nthe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\r\n\r\n17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was\r\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\r\n\r\n17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was\r\ncircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\r\n\r\n17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his\r\nson.\r\n\r\n17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with\r\nmoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\r\n\r\n18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat\r\nin the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes\r\nand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he\r\nran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the\r\nground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy\r\nsight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little\r\nwater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves\r\nunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort\r\nye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come\r\nto your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\r\n\r\n18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make\r\nready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes\r\nupon the hearth.\r\n\r\n18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,\r\nand gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\r\n\r\n18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,\r\nand set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they\r\ndid eat.\r\n\r\n18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\r\nBehold, in the tent.\r\n\r\n18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the\r\ntime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah\r\nheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\r\n\r\n18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it\r\nceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\r\n\r\n18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed\r\nold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORD\r\nsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a\r\nsurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard for\r\nthe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to\r\nthe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\r\n\r\n18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\r\nAnd he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\r\n\r\n18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\r\nAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.\r\n\r\n18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I\r\ndo; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\r\nnation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\r\n18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his\r\nhousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do\r\njustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which\r\nhe hath spoken of him.\r\n\r\n18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\r\ngreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go down\r\nnow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of\r\nit, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\r\n\r\n18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\r\nSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\r\n\r\n18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\r\nrighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fifty\r\nrighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the\r\nplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be far\r\nfrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the\r\nwicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far\r\nfrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 And\r\nthe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,\r\nthen I will spare all the place for their sakes.\r\n\r\n18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me\r\nto speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28\r\nPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou\r\ndestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there\r\nforty and five, I will not destroy it.\r\n\r\n18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\r\nshall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\r\nspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I\r\nwill not do it, if I find thirty there.\r\n\r\n18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the\r\nLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I\r\nwill not destroy it for twenty\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet\r\nbut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I\r\nwill not destroy it for ten\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with\r\nAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\r\n\r\n19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\r\ngate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed\r\nhimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,\r\nmy lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant\xe2\x80\x99s house, and tarry\r\nall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on\r\nyour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\r\nand entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake\r\nunleavened bread, and they did eat.\r\n\r\n19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\r\nSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people\r\nfrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,\r\nWhere are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out\r\nunto us, that we may know them.\r\n\r\n19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after\r\nhim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\r\n\r\n19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\r\nme, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good\r\nin your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they\r\nunder the shadow of my roof.\r\n\r\n19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow\r\ncame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal\r\nworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,\r\neven Lot, and came near to break the door.\r\n\r\n19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house\r\nto them, and shut to the door.\r\n\r\n19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\r\nblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to\r\nfind the door.\r\n\r\n19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\r\nlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the\r\ncity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy this\r\nplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the\r\nLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.\r\n\r\n19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married\r\nhis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD\r\nwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons\r\nin law.\r\n\r\n19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\r\nsaying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;\r\nlest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\r\n\r\n19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon\r\nthe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD\r\nbeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him\r\nwithout the city.\r\n\r\n19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\r\nthat he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay\r\nthou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\r\n\r\n19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,\r\nthy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy\r\nmercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot\r\nescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20\r\nBehold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:\r\nOh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this\r\nthing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou\r\nhast spoken.\r\n\r\n19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\r\nbe come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\r\n\r\n19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\r\n\r\n19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and\r\nfire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,\r\nand all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that\r\nwhich grew upon the ground.\r\n\r\n19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\r\npillar of salt.\r\n\r\n19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\r\nstood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,\r\nand toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke\r\nof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\r\n\r\n19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,\r\nthat God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the\r\noverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.\r\n\r\n19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his\r\ntwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt\r\nin a cave, he and his two daughters.\r\n\r\n19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and\r\nthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of\r\nall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we\r\nwill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\r\n\r\n19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\r\nfirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when\r\nshe lay down, nor when she arose.\r\n\r\n19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto\r\nthe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him\r\ndrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we\r\nmay preserve seed of our father.\r\n\r\n19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\r\nyounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay\r\ndown, nor when she arose.\r\n\r\n19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.\r\n\r\n19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\r\nsame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\r\n\r\n19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\r\nBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and\r\ndwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\r\n\r\n20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\r\nAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\r\n\r\n20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,\r\nBehold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;\r\nfor she is a man\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou\r\nslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my\r\nsister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the\r\nintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\r\n\r\n20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\r\nthis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from\r\nsinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.\r\n\r\n20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and\r\nhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her\r\nnot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are\r\nthine.\r\n\r\n20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his\r\nservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were\r\nsore afraid.\r\n\r\n20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou\r\ndone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on\r\nme and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that\r\nought not to be done.\r\n\r\n20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\r\nhast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,\r\nSurely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for\r\nmy wife\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\r\nfather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\r\n\r\n20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou\r\nshalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,\r\nHe is my brother.\r\n\r\n20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\r\nwomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where\r\nit pleaseth thee.\r\n\r\n20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\r\nthousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the\r\neyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was\r\nreproved.\r\n\r\n20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\r\nwife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\r\n\r\n20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\r\nAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto\r\nSarah as he had spoken.\r\n\r\n21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\r\nthe set time of which God had spoken to him.\r\n\r\n21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\r\nwhom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\r\n\r\n21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\r\nGod had commanded him.\r\n\r\n21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\n21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear\r\nwill laugh with me.\r\n\r\n21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should\r\nhave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.\r\n\r\n21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\r\nfeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\r\n\r\n21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born\r\nunto Abraham, mocking.\r\n\r\n21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her\r\nson: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even\r\nwith Isaac.\r\n\r\n21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s sight because of\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\r\nbecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah\r\nhath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy\r\nseed be called.\r\n\r\n21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\r\nbecause he is thy seed.\r\n\r\n21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a\r\nbottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,\r\nand the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in\r\nthe wilderness of Beersheba.\r\n\r\n21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\r\nunder one of the shrubs.\r\n\r\n21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,\r\nas it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the\r\nchild. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\r\n\r\n21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called\r\nto Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?\r\nfear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.\r\n\r\n21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\r\nmake him a great nation.\r\n\r\n21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\r\nwent, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.\r\n\r\n21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\r\nwilderness, and became an archer.\r\n\r\n21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him\r\na wife out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the\r\nchief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee\r\nin all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God\r\nthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,\r\nthou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\r\n\r\n21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.\r\n\r\n21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which\r\nAbimelech\xe2\x80\x99s servants had violently taken away.\r\n\r\n21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither\r\ndidst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.\r\n\r\n21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\r\nand both of them made a covenant.\r\n\r\n21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\r\n\r\n21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs\r\nwhich thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven\r\newe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto\r\nme, that I have digged this well.\r\n\r\n21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\r\nsware both of them.\r\n\r\n21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,\r\nand Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the\r\nland of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\r\nthe name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\r\n\r\n21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines\xe2\x80\x99 land many days.\r\n\r\n22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\r\nAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\r\n\r\n22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\r\nlovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for\r\na burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\r\n\r\n22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\r\nand took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave\r\nthe wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place\r\nof which God had told him.\r\n\r\n22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\r\nplace afar off.\r\n\r\n22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;\r\nand I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\r\n\r\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon\r\nIsaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they\r\nwent both of them together.\r\n\r\n22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and\r\nhe said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:\r\nbut where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My\r\nson, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they\r\nwent both of them together.\r\n\r\n22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham\r\nbuilt an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his\r\nson, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\r\n\r\n22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\r\nsaid, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\r\n\r\n22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou\r\nany thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou\r\nhast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\r\n\r\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind\r\nhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took\r\nthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his\r\nson.\r\n\r\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is\r\nsaid to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.\r\n\r\n22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the\r\nsecond time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,\r\nfor because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\r\nthine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in\r\nmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and\r\nas the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess\r\nthe gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations\r\nof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.\r\n\r\n22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and\r\nwent together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\r\n\r\n22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told\r\nAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy\r\nbrother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and\r\nKemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,\r\nand Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\r\n\r\n22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,\r\nAbraham\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\r\n\r\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,\r\nand Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\r\n\r\n23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these\r\nwere the years of the life of Sarah.\r\n\r\n23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of\r\nCanaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.\r\n\r\n23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the\r\nsons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:\r\ngive me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my\r\ndead out of my sight.\r\n\r\n23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6\r\nHear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of\r\nour sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his\r\nsepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\r\n\r\n23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the\r\nland, even to the children of Heth.\r\n\r\n23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I\r\nshould bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to\r\nEphron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of\r\nMachpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as\r\nmuch money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a\r\nburyingplace amongst you.\r\n\r\n23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the\r\nHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even\r\nof all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my\r\nlord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I\r\ngive it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:\r\nbury thy dead.\r\n\r\n23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\r\n\r\n23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the\r\nland, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will\r\ngive thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,\r\nhearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;\r\nwhat is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.\r\n\r\n23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron\r\nthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,\r\nfour hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.\r\n\r\n23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before\r\nMamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees\r\nthat were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were\r\nmade sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the\r\nchildren of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\r\n\r\n23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the\r\nfield of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of\r\nCanaan.\r\n\r\n23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto\r\nAbraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.\r\n\r\n24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had\r\nblessed Abraham in all things.\r\n\r\n24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled\r\nover all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3\r\nAnd I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God\r\nof the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the\r\ndaughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt\r\ngo unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son\r\nIsaac.\r\n\r\n24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be\r\nwilling to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again\r\nunto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto\r\nhim, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.\r\n\r\n24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and\r\nfrom the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware\r\nunto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send\r\nhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou\r\nshalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.\r\n\r\n24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his\r\nmaster, and sware to him concerning that matter.\r\n\r\n24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and\r\ndeparted; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he\r\narose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\r\n\r\n24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well\r\nof water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out\r\nto draw water.\r\n\r\n24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send\r\nme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.\r\n\r\n24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of\r\nthe men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to\r\npass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I\r\npray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give\r\nthy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed\r\nfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed\r\nkindness unto my master.\r\n\r\n24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,\r\nRebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of\r\nNahor, Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had\r\nany man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her\r\npitcher, and came up.\r\n\r\n24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,\r\ndrink a little water of thy pitcher.\r\n\r\n24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her\r\npitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.\r\n\r\n24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw\r\nwater for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.\r\n\r\n24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran\r\nagain unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.\r\n\r\n24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the\r\nLORD had made his journey prosperous or not.\r\n\r\n24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the\r\nman took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets\r\nfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose\r\ndaughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the\r\ndaughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.\r\n\r\n24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender\r\nenough, and room to lodge in.\r\n\r\n24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who\r\nhath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being\r\nin the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master\xe2\x80\x99s brethren.\r\n\r\n24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s house these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran\r\nout unto the man, unto the well.\r\n\r\n24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon\r\nhis sister\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,\r\nsaying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,\r\nbehold, he stood by the camels at the well.\r\n\r\n24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore\r\nstandest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the\r\ncamels.\r\n\r\n24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and\r\ngave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,\r\nand the men\xe2\x80\x99s feet that were with him.\r\n\r\n24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will\r\nnot eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.\r\n\r\n24:34 And he said, I am Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s servant.\r\n\r\n24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become\r\ngreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,\r\nand menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.\r\n\r\n24:36 And Sarah my master\xe2\x80\x99s wife bare a son to my master when she was\r\nold: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.\r\n\r\n24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife\r\nto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:\r\n24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and to my kindred, and\r\ntake a wife unto my son.\r\n\r\n24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not\r\nfollow me.\r\n\r\n24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his\r\nangel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for\r\nmy son of my kindred, and of my father\xe2\x80\x99s house: 24:41 Then shalt thou\r\nbe clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if\r\nthey give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.\r\n\r\n24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my\r\nmaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43\r\nBehold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that\r\nwhen the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,\r\nI pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she say\r\nto me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the\r\nsame be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson.\r\n\r\n24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah\r\ncame forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto\r\nthe well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,\r\nand said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,\r\nand she made the camels drink also.\r\n\r\n24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she\r\nsaid, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor\xe2\x80\x99s son, whom Milcah bare unto him:\r\nand I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.\r\n\r\n24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed\r\nthe LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way\r\nto take my master\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter unto his son.\r\n\r\n24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell\r\nme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth\r\nfrom the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\r\n\r\n24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be\r\nthy master\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x99s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\r\n\r\n24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s servant heard their\r\nwords, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\r\n\r\n24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of\r\ngold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her\r\nbrother and to her mother precious things.\r\n\r\n24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,\r\nand tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,\r\nSend me away unto my master.\r\n\r\n24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with\r\nus a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\r\n\r\n24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath\r\nprospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\r\n\r\n24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with\r\nthis man? And she said, I will go.\r\n\r\n24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and\r\nAbraham\xe2\x80\x99s servant, and his men.\r\n\r\n24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our\r\nsister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed\r\npossess the gate of those which hate them.\r\n\r\n24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the\r\ncamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt\r\nin the south country.\r\n\r\n24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and\r\nhe lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.\r\n\r\n24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she\r\nlighted off the camel.\r\n\r\n24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh\r\nin the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:\r\ntherefore she took a vail, and covered herself.\r\n\r\n24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\r\n\r\n24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s tent, and took\r\nRebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was\r\ncomforted after his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\r\n\r\n25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and\r\nIshbak, and Shuah.\r\n\r\n25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were\r\nAsshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\r\n\r\n25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,\r\nand Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\r\n\r\n25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\r\n\r\n25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham\r\ngave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,\r\neastward, unto the east country.\r\n\r\n25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s life which he\r\nlived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\r\n\r\n25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an\r\nold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\r\n\r\n25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of\r\nMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which\r\nis before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons\r\nof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\r\n\r\n25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed\r\nhis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\r\n\r\n25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s son, whom\r\nHagar the Egyptian, Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 And\r\nthese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according\r\nto their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,\r\nand Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15\r\nHadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sons\r\nof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their\r\ncastles; twelve princes according to their nations.\r\n\r\n25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and\r\nthirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was\r\ngathered unto his people.\r\n\r\n25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as\r\nthou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s son: Abraham\r\nbegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah\r\nto wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister\r\nto Laban the Syrian.\r\n\r\n25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was\r\nbarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\n25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If\r\nit be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two\r\nmanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one\r\npeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall\r\nserve the younger.\r\n\r\n25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there\r\nwere twins in her womb.\r\n\r\n25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and\r\nthey called his name Esau.\r\n\r\n25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on\r\nEsau\xe2\x80\x99s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore\r\nyears old when she bare them.\r\n\r\n25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the\r\nfield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\r\n\r\n25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but\r\nRebekah loved Jacob.\r\n\r\n25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was\r\nfaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that\r\nsame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.\r\n\r\n25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\r\n\r\n25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit\r\nshall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me\r\nthis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto\r\nJacob.\r\n\r\n25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did\r\neat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his\r\nbirthright.\r\n\r\n26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that\r\nwas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the\r\nPhilistines unto Gerar.\r\n\r\n26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;\r\ndwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in this\r\nland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and\r\nunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the\r\noath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thy\r\nseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed\r\nall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the\r\nearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept\r\nmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\r\n\r\n26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him\r\nof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She\r\nis my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for\r\nRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.\r\n\r\n26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that\r\nAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,\r\nand, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\r\n\r\n26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is\r\nthy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto\r\nhim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\r\n\r\n26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of\r\nthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest\r\nhave brought guiltiness upon us.\r\n\r\n26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth\r\nthis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an\r\nhundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\r\n\r\n26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he\r\nbecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and\r\npossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines\r\nenvied him.\r\n\r\n26:15 For all the wells which his father\xe2\x80\x99s servants had digged in the\r\ndays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and\r\nfilled them with earth.\r\n\r\n26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much\r\nmightier than we.\r\n\r\n26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of\r\nGerar, and dwelt there.\r\n\r\n26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged\r\nin the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped\r\nthem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the\r\nnames by which his father had called them.\r\n\r\n26:19 And Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s servants digged in the valley, and found there a\r\nwell of springing water.\r\n\r\n26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s herdmen,\r\nsaying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;\r\nbecause they strove with him.\r\n\r\n26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he\r\ncalled the name of it Sitnah.\r\n\r\n26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for\r\nthat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he\r\nsaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\n26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\r\n\r\n26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am\r\nthe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will\r\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the\r\nLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s servants digged a\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his\r\nfriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\r\n\r\n26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye\r\nhate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We saw\r\ncertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now\r\nan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a\r\ncovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not\r\ntouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have\r\nsent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\r\n\r\n26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\r\n\r\n26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to\r\nanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s servants came,\r\nand told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto\r\nhim, We have found water.\r\n\r\n26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is\r\nBeersheba unto this day.\r\n\r\n26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the\r\ndaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the\r\nHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\r\n\r\n27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were\r\ndim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said\r\nunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.\r\n\r\n27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my\r\ndeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver\r\nand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4\r\nAnd make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I\r\nmay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\r\n\r\n27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went\r\nto the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\r\n\r\n27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy\r\nfather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, and\r\nmake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD\r\nbefore my death.\r\n\r\n27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I\r\ncommand thee.\r\n\r\n27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of\r\nthe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as\r\nhe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may\r\neat, and that he may bless thee before his death.\r\n\r\n27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is\r\na hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will\r\nfeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a\r\ncurse upon me, and not a blessing.\r\n\r\n27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only\r\nobey my voice, and go fetch me them.\r\n\r\n27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and\r\nhis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\r\n\r\n27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which\r\nwere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:\r\n27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,\r\nand upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meat\r\nand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\r\n\r\n27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,\r\nHere am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his\r\nfather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest\r\nme: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may\r\nbless me.\r\n\r\n27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it\r\nso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may\r\nfeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\r\n\r\n27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and\r\nsaid, The voice is Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\r\n\r\n27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his\r\nbrother Esau\xe2\x80\x99s hands: so he blessed him.\r\n\r\n27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\r\n\r\n27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,\r\nand he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\r\n\r\n27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,\r\nmy son.\r\n\r\n27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of\r\nhis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as\r\nthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore God\r\ngive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and\r\nplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow\r\ndown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s sons bow\r\ndown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he\r\nthat blesseth thee.\r\n\r\n27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of\r\nblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of\r\nIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\r\n\r\n27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his\r\nfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s venison, that thy soul may bless me.\r\n\r\n27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I\r\nam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\r\n\r\n27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he\r\nthat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all\r\nbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be\r\nblessed.\r\n\r\n27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a\r\ngreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,\r\neven me also, O my father.\r\n\r\n27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away\r\nthy blessing.\r\n\r\n27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath\r\nsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,\r\nbehold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not\r\nreserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said unto\r\nEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I\r\ngiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained\r\nhim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau said\r\nunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even\r\nme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\r\n\r\n27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy\r\ndwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven\r\nfrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve\r\nthy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the\r\ndominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\r\n\r\n27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his\r\nfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning\r\nfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\r\n\r\n27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and\r\nshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,\r\nthy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to\r\nkill thee.\r\n\r\n27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban\r\nmy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thy\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s anger turn away\r\nfrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will\r\nsend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you\r\nboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my\r\nlife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the\r\ndaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the\r\nland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, and\r\nblessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a\r\nwife of the daughters of Canaan.\r\n\r\n28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\r\n\r\n28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply\r\nthee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give thee\r\nthe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou\r\nmayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave\r\nunto Abraham.\r\n\r\n28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,\r\nson of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s and Esau\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to\r\nPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him\r\nhe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the\r\ndaughters of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his\r\nmother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that the\r\ndaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esau\r\nunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the\r\ndaughter of Ishmael Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\r\n\r\n28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all\r\nnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that\r\nplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the\r\ntop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending\r\nand descending on it.\r\n\r\n28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD\r\nGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou\r\nliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seed\r\nshall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the\r\nwest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee\r\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\r\n\r\n28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places\r\nwhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I\r\nwill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to\r\nthee of.\r\n\r\n28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD\r\nis in this place; and I knew it not.\r\n\r\n28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is\r\nnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\r\n\r\n28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that\r\nhe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil\r\nupon the top of it.\r\n\r\n28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of\r\nthat city was called Luz at the first.\r\n\r\n28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will\r\nkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and\r\nraiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father\xe2\x80\x99s house in\r\npeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which I\r\nhave set for a pillar, shall be God\xe2\x80\x99s house: and of all that thou\r\nshalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\r\n\r\n29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the\r\npeople of the east.\r\n\r\n29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there\r\nwere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they\r\nwatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\r\n\r\n29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the\r\nstone from the well\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone\r\nagain upon the well\xe2\x80\x99s mouth in his place.\r\n\r\n29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they\r\nsaid, Of Haran are we.\r\n\r\n29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they\r\nsaid, We know him.\r\n\r\n29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:\r\nand, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\r\n\r\n29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the\r\ncattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and\r\nfeed them.\r\n\r\n29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered\r\ntogether, and till they roll the stone from the well\xe2\x80\x99s mouth; then we\r\nwater the sheep.\r\n\r\n29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsheep; for she kept them.\r\n\r\n29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\xe2\x80\x99s brother,\r\nthat Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and\r\nwatered the flock of Laban his mother\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\r\n\r\n29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\r\n\r\n29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and that\r\nhe was Rebekah\xe2\x80\x99s son: and she ran and told her father.\r\n\r\n29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed\r\nhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.\r\n\r\n29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And\r\nhe abode with him the space of a month.\r\n\r\n29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,\r\nshouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy\r\nwages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder\r\nwas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\r\n\r\n29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well\r\nfavoured.\r\n\r\n29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years\r\nfor Rachel thy younger daughter.\r\n\r\n29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that\r\nI should give her to another man: abide with me.\r\n\r\n29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto\r\nhim but a few days, for the love he had to her.\r\n\r\n29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are\r\nfulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\r\n\r\n29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his\r\ndaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\r\n\r\n29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an\r\nhandmaid.\r\n\r\n29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:\r\nand he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I\r\nserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?\r\n29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give\r\nthe younger before the firstborn.\r\n\r\n29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service\r\nwhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\r\n\r\n29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel\r\nhis daughter to wife also.\r\n\r\n29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be\r\nher maid.\r\n\r\n29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more\r\nthan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\r\n\r\n29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:\r\nbut Rachel was barren.\r\n\r\n29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name\r\nReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;\r\nnow therefore my husband will love me.\r\n\r\n29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the\r\nLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:\r\nand she called his name Simeon.\r\n\r\n29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time\r\nwill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:\r\ntherefore was his name called Levi.\r\n\r\n29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will\r\nI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\n30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\r\nenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n30:2 And Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I\r\nin God\xe2\x80\x99s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\r\n30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she\r\nshall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\r\n\r\n30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in\r\nunto her.\r\n\r\n30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\r\n\r\n30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my\r\nvoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\r\n\r\n30:7 And Bilhah Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second\r\nson.\r\n\r\n30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my\r\nsister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\r\n\r\n30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her\r\nmaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\r\n\r\n30:10 And Zilpah Leah\xe2\x80\x99s maid bare Jacob a son.\r\n\r\n30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\r\n\r\n30:12 And Zilpah Leah\xe2\x80\x99s maid bare Jacob a second son.\r\n\r\n30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\r\nblessed: and she called his name Asher.\r\n\r\n30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\r\nmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then\r\nRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son\xe2\x80\x99s mandrakes.\r\n\r\n30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken\r\nmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son\xe2\x80\x99s mandrakes also? And\r\nRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmandrakes.\r\n\r\n30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\r\nout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I\r\nhave hired thee with my son\xe2\x80\x99s mandrakes. And he lay with her that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\r\nthe fifth son.\r\n\r\n30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\r\nmy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\r\n\r\n30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\r\n\r\n30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my\r\nhusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she\r\ncalled his name Zebulun.\r\n\r\n30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\r\n\r\n30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened\r\nher womb.\r\n\r\n30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away\r\nmy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD\r\nshall add to me another son.\r\n\r\n30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\r\nsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and\r\nto my country.\r\n\r\n30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\r\nand let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\r\n\r\n30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in\r\nthine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath\r\nblessed me for thy sake.\r\n\r\n30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\r\n\r\n30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\r\nhow thy cattle was with me.\r\n\r\n30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now\r\nincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my\r\ncoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31\r\nAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not\r\ngive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again\r\nfeed and keep thy flock.\r\n\r\n30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\r\nall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among\r\nthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such\r\nshall be my hire.\r\n\r\n30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it\r\nshall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled\r\nand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be\r\ncounted stolen with me.\r\n\r\n30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\r\nword.\r\n\r\n30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\r\nspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and\r\nevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the\r\nsheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\r\n\r\n30:36 And he set three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\r\nJacob fed the rest of Laban\xe2\x80\x99s flocks.\r\n\r\n30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\r\nchestnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white\r\nappear which was in the rods.\r\n\r\n30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the\r\ngutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that\r\nthey should conceive when they came to drink.\r\n\r\n30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\r\ncattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\r\n\r\n30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\r\nflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of\r\nLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto\r\nLaban\xe2\x80\x99s cattle.\r\n\r\n30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\r\nconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in\r\nthe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.\r\n\r\n30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\r\nfeebler were Laban\xe2\x80\x99s, and the stronger Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\r\nmaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\r\n\r\n31:1 And he heard the words of Laban\xe2\x80\x99s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken\r\naway all that was our father\xe2\x80\x99s; and of that which was our father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhath he gotten all this glory.\r\n\r\n31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\r\nnot toward him as before.\r\n\r\n31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\r\nfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\r\n\r\n31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his\r\nflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, that\r\nit is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\r\n\r\n31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;\r\nbut God suffered him not to hurt me.\r\n\r\n31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\r\ncattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be\r\nthy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\r\n\r\n31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\r\nthem to me.\r\n\r\n31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that\r\nI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which\r\nleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.\r\n\r\n31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\r\nAnd I said, Here am I.\r\n\r\n31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which\r\nleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I\r\nhave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\r\n\r\n31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\r\nwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this\r\nland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\r\n\r\n31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any\r\nportion or inheritance for us in our father\xe2\x80\x99s house?  31:15 Are we not\r\ncounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured\r\nalso our money.\r\n\r\n31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is\r\nours, and our children\xe2\x80\x99s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto\r\nthee, do.\r\n\r\n31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;\r\n31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\r\nhad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\r\nPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\r\nimages that were her father\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\r\ntold him not that he fled.\r\n\r\n31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over\r\nthe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\r\n\r\n31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\r\n\r\n31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\r\n\r\n31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\r\nunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\r\n\r\n31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the\r\nmount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.\r\n\r\n31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\r\nstolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives\r\ntaken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,\r\nand steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent\r\nthee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\r\n31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou\r\nhast now done foolishly in so doing.\r\n\r\n31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\r\nyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that\r\nthou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\r\n\r\n31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\r\nlongedst after thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my\r\ngods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was\r\nafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\r\ndaughters from me.\r\n\r\n31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before\r\nour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.\r\nFor Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.\r\n\r\n31:33 And Laban went into Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s tent, and into Leah\xe2\x80\x99s tent, and into\r\nthe two maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 tents; but he found them not. Then went he out\r\nof Leah\xe2\x80\x99s tent, and entered into Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s tent.\r\n\r\n31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but\r\nfound them not.\r\n\r\n31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I\r\ncannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he\r\nsearched but found not the images.\r\n\r\n31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\r\nand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast\r\nso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my\r\nstuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here\r\nbefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\r\ngoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\r\nthe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by\r\nday, or stolen by night.\r\n\r\n31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by\r\nnight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\r\n\r\n31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\r\nfourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:\r\nand thou hast changed my wages ten times.\r\n\r\n31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of\r\nIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God\r\nhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee\r\nyesternight.\r\n\r\n31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\r\ndaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my\r\ncattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day\r\nunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?\r\n31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and\r\nlet it be for a witness between me and thee.\r\n\r\n31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\r\n\r\n31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\r\nstones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\r\n\r\n31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\r\n\r\n31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nTherefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he\r\nsaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other\r\nwives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness\r\nbetwixt me and thee.\r\n\r\n31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\r\npillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be\r\nwitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this\r\nheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this\r\npillar unto me, for harm.\r\n\r\n31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\r\nfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father\r\nIsaac.\r\n\r\n31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\r\nbrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night\r\nin the mount.\r\n\r\n31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and\r\nhis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\n32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\r\n\r\n32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God\xe2\x80\x99s host: and he\r\ncalled the name of that place Mahanaim.\r\n\r\n32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the\r\nland of Seir, the country of Edom.\r\n\r\n32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord\r\nEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and\r\nstayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and\r\nmenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that\r\nI may find grace in thy sight.\r\n\r\n32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\r\nbrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the\r\npeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,\r\ninto two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and\r\nsmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.\r\n\r\n32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father\r\nIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to\r\nthy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of\r\nthe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast\r\nshewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;\r\nand now I am become two bands.\r\n\r\n32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\r\nhand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the\r\nmother with the children.\r\n\r\n32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\r\nas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\r\n\r\n32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came\r\nto his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she\r\ngoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15\r\nThirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,\r\ntwenty she asses, and ten foals.\r\n\r\n32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove\r\nby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and\r\nput a space betwixt drove and drove.\r\n\r\n32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\r\nmeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither\r\ngoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt\r\nsay, They be thy servant Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s; it is a present sent unto my lord\r\nEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.\r\n\r\n32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\r\nfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,\r\nwhen ye find him.\r\n\r\n32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For\r\nhe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and\r\nafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.\r\n\r\n32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\r\nnight in the company.\r\n\r\n32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\r\nwomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.\r\n\r\n32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\r\nthat he had.\r\n\r\n32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\r\nuntil the breaking of the day.\r\n\r\n32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\r\nthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s thigh was out of\r\njoint, as he wrestled with him.\r\n\r\n32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\r\nwill not let thee go, except thou bless me.\r\n\r\n32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\r\n\r\n32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:\r\nfor as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\r\nAnd he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he\r\nblessed him there.\r\n\r\n32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\r\nGod face to face, and my life is preserved.\r\n\r\n32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\r\nhalted upon his thigh.\r\n\r\n32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\r\nshrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because\r\nhe touched the hollow of Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s thigh in the sinew that shrank.\r\n\r\n33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,\r\nand with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,\r\nand unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.\r\n\r\n33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\r\nand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\r\n\r\n33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground\r\nseven times, until he came near to his brother.\r\n\r\n33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,\r\nand kissed him: and they wept.\r\n\r\n33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\r\nand said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God\r\nhath graciously given thy servant.\r\n\r\n33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they\r\nbowed themselves.\r\n\r\n33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:\r\nand after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\r\n\r\n33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And\r\nhe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\r\n\r\n33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\r\nunto thyself.\r\n\r\n33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\r\nthy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have\r\nseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast\r\npleased with me.\r\n\r\n33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because\r\nGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he\r\nurged him, and he took it.\r\n\r\n33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will\r\ngo before thee.\r\n\r\n33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\r\ntender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men\r\nshould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\r\n\r\n33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\r\nwill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and\r\nthe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\r\n\r\n33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that\r\nare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the\r\nsight of my lord.\r\n\r\n33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\r\n\r\n33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made\r\nbooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called\r\nSuccoth.\r\n\r\n33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\r\nland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent\r\nbefore the city.\r\n\r\n33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,\r\nat the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem\xe2\x80\x99s father, for an hundred\r\npieces of money.\r\n\r\n33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\r\n\r\n34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went\r\nout to see the daughters of the land.\r\n\r\n34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the\r\ncountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\r\n\r\n34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved\r\nthe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\r\n\r\n34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this\r\ndamsel to wife.\r\n\r\n34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his\r\nsons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until\r\nthey were come.\r\n\r\n34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:\r\nand the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had\r\nwrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s daughter: which thing\r\nought not to be done.\r\n\r\n34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem\r\nlongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.\r\n\r\n34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,\r\nand take our daughters unto you.\r\n\r\n34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;\r\ndwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\r\n\r\n34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me\r\nfind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.\r\n\r\n34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according\r\nas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\r\n\r\n34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father\r\ndeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:\r\n34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our\r\nsister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:\r\n34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,\r\nthat every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our\r\ndaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will\r\ndwell with you, and we will become one people.\r\n\r\n34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will\r\nwe take our daughter, and we will be gone.\r\n\r\n34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had\r\ndelight in Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the\r\nhouse of his father.\r\n\r\n34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,\r\nand communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men are\r\npeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade\r\ntherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us\r\ntake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,\r\nto be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are\r\ncircumcised.\r\n\r\n34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of\r\ntheirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went\r\nout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that\r\nwent out of the gate of his city.\r\n\r\n34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that\r\ntwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah\xe2\x80\x99s brethren, took each\r\nman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.\r\n\r\n34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the\r\nsword, and took Dinah out of Shechem\xe2\x80\x99s house, and went out.\r\n\r\n34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,\r\nbecause they had defiled their sister.\r\n\r\n34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that\r\nwhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And all\r\ntheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they\r\ncaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.\r\n\r\n34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make\r\nme to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites\r\nand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather\r\nthemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,\r\nI and my house.\r\n\r\n34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\r\n35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:\r\nand make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou\r\nfleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\r\n\r\n35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with\r\nhim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and\r\nchange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and\r\nI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my\r\ndistress, and was with me in the way which I went.\r\n\r\n35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their\r\nhand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid\r\nthem under the oak which was by Shechem.\r\n\r\n35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities\r\nthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of\r\nJacob.\r\n\r\n35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,\r\nBethel, he and all the people that were with him.\r\n\r\n35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:\r\nbecause there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n35:8 But Deborah Rebekah\xe2\x80\x99s nurse died, and she was buried beneath\r\nBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.\r\n\r\n35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,\r\nand blessed him.\r\n\r\n35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be\r\ncalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his\r\nname Israel.\r\n\r\n35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and\r\nmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and\r\nkings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gave\r\nAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee\r\nwill I give the land.\r\n\r\n35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.\r\n\r\n35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,\r\neven a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he\r\npoured oil thereon.\r\n\r\n35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,\r\nBethel.\r\n\r\n35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way\r\nto come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\r\n\r\n35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the\r\nmidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.\r\n\r\n35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she\r\ndied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him\r\nBenjamin.\r\n\r\n35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is\r\nBethlehem.\r\n\r\n35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s grave unto this day.\r\n\r\n35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of\r\nEdar.\r\n\r\n35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben\r\nwent and lay with Bilhah his father\xe2\x80\x99s concubine: and Israel heard it.\r\nNow the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,\r\nJacob\xe2\x80\x99s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and\r\nZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And the\r\nsons of Bilhah, Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And the\r\nsons of Zilpah, Leah\xe2\x80\x99s handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of\r\nJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.\r\n\r\n35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city\r\nof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.\r\n\r\n35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.\r\n\r\n35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his\r\npeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.\r\n\r\n36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter\r\nof Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter\r\nof Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, sister of\r\nNebajoth.\r\n\r\n36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 And\r\nAholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of\r\nEsau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all\r\nthe persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all\r\nhis substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into\r\nthe country from the face of his brother Jacob.\r\n\r\n36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;\r\nand the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because\r\nof their cattle.\r\n\r\n36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.\r\n\r\n36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites\r\nin mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau\xe2\x80\x99s sons; Eliphaz the\r\nson of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of\r\nEsau.\r\n\r\n36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and\r\nKenaz.\r\n\r\n36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau\xe2\x80\x99s son; and she bare to\r\nEliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and\r\nMizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the\r\ndaughter of Zibeon, Esau\xe2\x80\x99s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and\r\nJaalam, and Korah.\r\n\r\n36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the\r\nfirstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,\r\n36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes\r\nthat came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.\r\n\r\n36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau\xe2\x80\x99s son; duke Nahath, duke\r\nZerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of\r\nReuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau\xe2\x80\x99s wife; duke Jeush,\r\nduke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah\r\nthe daughter of Anah, Esau\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their\r\ndukes.\r\n\r\n36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;\r\nLotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer,\r\nand Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir\r\nin the land of Edom.\r\n\r\n36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister was Timna.\r\n\r\n36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and\r\nEbal, Shepho, and Onam.\r\n\r\n36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this\r\nwas that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the\r\nasses of Zibeon his father.\r\n\r\n36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the\r\ndaughter of Anah.\r\n\r\n36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and\r\nIthran, and Cheran.\r\n\r\n36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.\r\n\r\n36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.\r\n\r\n36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke\r\nShobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke\r\nDishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in\r\nthe land of Seir.\r\n\r\n36:31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before\r\nthere reigned any king over the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his\r\ncity was Dinhabah.\r\n\r\n36:33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\n36:34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n36:35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in\r\nthe field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was\r\nAvith.\r\n\r\n36:36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\n36:38 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n36:39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his\r\nstead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nMehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.\r\n\r\n36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,\r\naccording to their families, after their places, by their names; duke\r\nTimnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah,\r\nduke Pinon, 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 Duke\r\nMagdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their\r\nhabitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of\r\nthe Edomites.\r\n\r\n37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in\r\nthe land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years\r\nold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the\r\nsons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father\xe2\x80\x99s wives: and\r\nJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.\r\n\r\n37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he\r\nwas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\r\n\r\n37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than\r\nall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they\r\nhated him yet the more.\r\n\r\n37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have\r\ndreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,\r\nlo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves\r\nstood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.\r\n\r\n37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or\r\nshalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the\r\nmore for his dreams, and for his words.\r\n\r\n37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and\r\nsaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and\r\nthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\r\n\r\n37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his\r\nfather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou\r\nhast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to\r\nbow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethren\r\nenvied him; but his father observed the saying.\r\n\r\n37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father\xe2\x80\x99s flock in Shechem.\r\n\r\n37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock\r\nin Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,\r\nHere am I.\r\n\r\n37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with\r\nthy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he\r\nsent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\r\n\r\n37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in\r\nthe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16\r\nAnd he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed\r\ntheir flocks.\r\n\r\n37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,\r\nLet us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found\r\nthem in Dothan.\r\n\r\n37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto\r\nthem, they conspired against him to slay him.\r\n\r\n37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\r\n\r\n37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some\r\npit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall\r\nsee what will become of his dreams.\r\n\r\n37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;\r\nand said, Let us not kill him.\r\n\r\n37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this\r\npit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might\r\nrid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.\r\n\r\n37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,\r\nthat they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that\r\nwas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the\r\npit was empty, there was no water in it.\r\n\r\n37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes\r\nand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead\r\nwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry\r\nit down to Egypt.\r\n\r\n37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay\r\nour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell him\r\nto the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our\r\nbrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.\r\n\r\n37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and\r\nlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites\r\nfor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\r\n\r\n37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in\r\nthe pit; and he rent his clothes.\r\n\r\n37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;\r\nand I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and\r\nkilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 And\r\nthey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their\r\nfather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoat or no.\r\n\r\n37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son\xe2\x80\x99s coat; an evil beast\r\nhath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\r\n\r\n37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,\r\nand mourned for his son many days.\r\n\r\n37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;\r\nbut he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into\r\nthe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\r\n\r\n37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer\r\nof Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s, and captain of the guard.\r\n\r\n38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his\r\nbrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\r\n\r\n38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name\r\nwas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\r\n\r\n38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\r\n\r\n38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name\r\nOnan.\r\n\r\n38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name\r\nShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\r\n\r\n38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.\r\n\r\n38:7 And Er, Judah\xe2\x80\x99s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;\r\nand the LORD slew him.\r\n\r\n38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and\r\nmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\r\n\r\n38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\r\npass, when he went in unto his brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife, that he spilled it on\r\nthe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.\r\n\r\n38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\r\nslew him also.\r\n\r\n38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at\r\nthy father\xe2\x80\x99s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest\r\nperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and\r\ndwelt in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah\xe2\x80\x99s wife died;\r\nand Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to\r\nTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\r\n\r\n38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up\r\nto Timnath to shear his sheep.\r\n\r\n38:14 And she put her widow\xe2\x80\x99s garments off from her, and covered her\r\nwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is\r\nby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was\r\nnot given unto him to wife.\r\n\r\n38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she\r\nhad covered her face.\r\n\r\n38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,\r\nlet me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter\r\nin law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come\r\nin unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.\r\nAnd she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18\r\nAnd he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,\r\nand thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it\r\nher, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.\r\n\r\n38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and\r\nput on the garments of her widowhood.\r\n\r\n38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,\r\nto receive his pledge from the woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand: but he found her not.\r\n\r\n38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\r\nharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no\r\nharlot in this place.\r\n\r\n38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also\r\nthe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.\r\n\r\n38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\r\nbehold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\r\n\r\n38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\r\nJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and\r\nalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her\r\nforth, and let her be burnt.\r\n\r\n38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\r\nsaying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,\r\nDiscern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\r\nrighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he\r\nknew her again no more.\r\n\r\n38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\r\ntwins were in her womb.\r\n\r\n38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\r\nhis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet\r\nthread, saying, This came out first.\r\n\r\n38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his\r\nbrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this\r\nbreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\r\n\r\n38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread\r\nupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\r\n\r\n39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of\r\nPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of\r\nthe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.\r\n\r\n39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he\r\nwas in the house of his master the Egyptian.\r\n\r\n39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD\r\nmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.\r\n\r\n39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\r\nmade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer\r\nin his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the\r\nEgyptian\xe2\x80\x99s house for Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was\r\nupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.\r\n\r\n39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s hand; and he knew not\r\nought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly\r\nperson, and well favoured.\r\n\r\n39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\ncast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\r\n\r\n39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Behold, my\r\nmaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed\r\nall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this house\r\nthan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because\r\nthou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin\r\nagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by\r\nday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\r\n\r\n39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the\r\nhouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house\r\nthere within.\r\n\r\n39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he\r\nleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\r\n\r\n39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment\r\nin her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men of\r\nher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an\r\nHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I\r\ncried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that\r\nI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and\r\nfled, and got him out.\r\n\r\n39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\r\n\r\n39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The\r\nHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to\r\nmock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,\r\nthat he left his garment with me, and fled out.\r\n\r\n39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his\r\nwife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy\r\nservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\r\n\r\n39:20 And Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s master took him, and put him into the prison, a\r\nplace where the king\xe2\x80\x99s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him\r\nfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\r\n\r\n39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s hand all the\r\nprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he\r\nwas the doer of it.\r\n\r\n39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under\r\nhis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the\r\nLORD made it to prosper.\r\n\r\n40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the\r\nking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.\r\n\r\n40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the\r\nchief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\r\n\r\n40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,\r\ninto the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\r\n\r\n40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he\r\nserved them: and they continued a season in ward.\r\n\r\n40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one\r\nnight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the\r\nbutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon\r\nthem, and, behold, they were sad.\r\n\r\n40:7 And he asked Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s officers that were with him in the ward of\r\nhis lord\xe2\x80\x99s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And\r\nthey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no\r\ninterpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations\r\nbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\r\n\r\n40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,\r\nIn my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were\r\nthree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot\r\nforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And\r\nPharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them\r\ninto Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The\r\nthree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall\r\nPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou\r\nshalt deliver Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s cup into his hand, after the former manner\r\nwhen thou wast his butler.\r\n\r\n40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\r\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,\r\nand bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out\r\nof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that\r\nthey should put me into the dungeon.\r\n\r\n40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\r\nsaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three\r\nwhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was\r\nof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out\r\nof the basket upon my head.\r\n\r\n40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\r\nthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days\r\nshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a\r\ntree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\r\n\r\n40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s birthday,\r\nthat he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head\r\nof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.\r\n\r\n40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and\r\nhe gave the cup into Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief\r\nbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.\r\n\r\n40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\r\n\r\n41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\r\ndreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\r\n\r\n41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured\r\nkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\r\n\r\n41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\r\nriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon\r\nthe brink of the river.\r\n\r\n41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\r\nwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\r\n\r\n41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears\r\nof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\r\n\r\n41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\r\nsprung up after them.\r\n\r\n41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\r\nAnd Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\r\n\r\n41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;\r\nand he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the\r\nwise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none\r\nthat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember\r\nmy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put\r\nme in ward in the captain of the guard\xe2\x80\x99s house, both me and the chief\r\nbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed\r\neach man according to the interpretation of his dream.\r\n\r\n41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\r\nthe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us\r\nour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.\r\n\r\n41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\r\nrestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\r\n\r\n41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\r\nhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his\r\nraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there\r\nis none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou\r\ncanst understand a dream to interpret it.\r\n\r\n41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall\r\ngive Pharaoh an answer of peace.\r\n\r\n41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon\r\nthe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the\r\nriver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a\r\nmeadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor\r\nand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the\r\nland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured\r\nkine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had\r\neaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but\r\nthey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.\r\n\r\n41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\r\nstalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,\r\nand blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the\r\nthin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the\r\nmagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.\r\n\r\n41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\r\nhath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\r\n\r\n41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are\r\nseven years: the dream is one.\r\n\r\n41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them\r\nare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind\r\nshall be seven years of famine.\r\n\r\n41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is\r\nabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\r\nthe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years\r\nof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;\r\nand the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not\r\nbe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall\r\nbe very grievous.\r\n\r\n41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\r\nbecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it\r\nto pass.\r\n\r\n41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and\r\nset him over the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,\r\nand take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,\r\nand lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in\r\nthe cities.\r\n\r\n41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\r\nyears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land\r\nperish not through the famine.\r\n\r\n41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\r\nof all his servants.\r\n\r\n41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\r\nthis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said\r\nunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none\r\nso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,\r\nand according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the\r\nthrone will I be greater than thou.\r\n\r\n41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the\r\nland of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a\r\ngold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second\r\nchariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he\r\nmade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\r\nshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\r\nhim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And\r\nJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\r\nking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and\r\nwent throughout all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\r\nhandfuls.\r\n\r\n41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\r\nin the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of\r\nthe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.\r\n\r\n41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\r\nuntil he left numbering; for it was without number.\r\n\r\n41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\r\ncame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,\r\nsaid he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\r\ncaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\r\n\r\n41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of\r\nEgypt, were ended.\r\n\r\n41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph\r\nhad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of\r\nEgypt there was bread.\r\n\r\n41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to\r\nPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto\r\nJoseph; what he saith to you, do.\r\n\r\n41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\r\nopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the\r\nfamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;\r\nbecause that the famine was so sore in all lands.\r\n\r\n42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto\r\nhis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,\r\nI have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and\r\nbuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.\r\n\r\n42:3 And Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\r\n\r\n42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;\r\nfor he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\r\n\r\n42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:\r\nfor the famine was in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that\r\nsold to all the people of the land: and Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s brethren came, and\r\nbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\r\n\r\n42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself\r\nstrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,\r\nWhence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\r\n\r\n42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\r\n\r\n42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and\r\nsaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\r\nservants come.\r\n\r\n42:11 We are all one man\xe2\x80\x99s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no\r\nspies.\r\n\r\n42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land\r\nye are come.\r\n\r\n42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one\r\nman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with\r\nour father, and one is not.\r\n\r\n42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\r\nsaying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of\r\nPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come\r\nhither.\r\n\r\n42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be\r\nkept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any\r\ntruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.\r\n\r\n42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.\r\n\r\n42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for\r\nI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound\r\nin the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your\r\nhouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your\r\nwords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\r\n\r\n42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\r\nour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought\r\nus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\r\n\r\n42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,\r\nDo not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,\r\nbehold, also his blood is required.\r\n\r\n42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto\r\nthem by an interpreter.\r\n\r\n42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to\r\nthem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and\r\nbound him before their eyes.\r\n\r\n42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to\r\nrestore every man\xe2\x80\x99s money into his sack, and to give them provision\r\nfor the way: and thus did he unto them.\r\n\r\n42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\r\n\r\n42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in\r\nthe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\r\n\r\n42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it\r\nis even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,\r\nsaying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29\r\nAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and\r\ntold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the\r\nlord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We\r\nbe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest\r\nis this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall\r\nI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,\r\nand take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34\r\nAnd bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are\r\nno spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your\r\nbrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\r\n\r\n42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,\r\nevery man\xe2\x80\x99s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and\r\ntheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.\r\n\r\n42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my\r\nchildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin\r\naway: all these things are against me.\r\n\r\n42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I\r\nbring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him\r\nto thee again.\r\n\r\n42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother\r\nis dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in\r\nthe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\n43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.\r\n\r\n43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they\r\nhad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy\r\nus a little food.\r\n\r\n43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest\r\nunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy\r\nthee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:\r\nfor the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your\r\nbrother be with you.\r\n\r\n43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell\r\nthe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man\r\nasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your\r\nfather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according\r\nto the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would\r\nsay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his\r\nfather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may\r\nlive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.\r\n\r\n43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I\r\nbring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the\r\nblame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had\r\nreturned this second time.\r\n\r\n43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do\r\nthis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry\r\ndown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and\r\nmyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;\r\nand the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry\r\nit again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take\r\nalso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God\r\nAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your\r\nother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am\r\nbereaved.\r\n\r\n43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in\r\ntheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and\r\nstood before Joseph.\r\n\r\n43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of\r\nhis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these\r\nmen shall dine with me at noon.\r\n\r\n43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our\r\nsacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion\r\nagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.\r\n\r\n43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s house, and they\r\ncommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we\r\ncame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to\r\npass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,\r\nevery man\xe2\x80\x99s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full\r\nweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.\r\n\r\n43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\r\nwe cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\r\n\r\n43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of\r\nyour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.\r\nAnd he brought Simeon out unto them.\r\n\r\n43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s house, and gave them\r\nwater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.\r\n\r\n43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for\r\nthey heard that they should eat bread there.\r\n\r\n43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which\r\nwas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father\r\nwell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they\r\nanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.\r\nAnd they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.\r\n\r\n43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake\r\nunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.\r\n\r\n43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\r\nbrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,\r\nand wept there.\r\n\r\n43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and\r\nsaid, Set on bread.\r\n\r\n43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,\r\nand for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because\r\nthe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an\r\nabomination unto the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his\r\nbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men\r\nmarvelled one at another.\r\n\r\n43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\r\nBenjamin\xe2\x80\x99s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they\r\ndrank, and were merry with him.\r\n\r\n44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man\xe2\x80\x99s money\r\nin his sack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\r\n\r\n44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack\xe2\x80\x99s mouth of the\r\nyoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that\r\nJoseph had spoken.\r\n\r\n44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\r\nand their asses.\r\n\r\n44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\r\nJoseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou\r\ndost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for\r\ngood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby\r\nindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\r\n\r\n44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\r\n\r\n44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God\r\nforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8\r\nBehold, the money, which we found in our sacks\xe2\x80\x99 mouths, we brought\r\nagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal\r\nout of thy lord\xe2\x80\x99s house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy\r\nservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbondmen.\r\n\r\n44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\r\nwith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.\r\n\r\n44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\r\nand opened every man his sack.\r\n\r\n44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\r\nyoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s sack.\r\n\r\n44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\r\nreturned to the city.\r\n\r\n44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s house; for he was\r\nyet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\r\n\r\n44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?\r\nwot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah\r\nsaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how\r\nshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy\r\nservants: behold, we are my lord\xe2\x80\x99s servants, both we, and he also with\r\nwhom the cup is found.\r\n\r\n44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\r\nwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,\r\nget you up in peace unto your father.\r\n\r\n44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\r\nservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and let not\r\nthine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\r\nbrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old\r\nman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is\r\ndead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\r\n\r\n44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that\r\nI may set mine eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\r\nif he should leave his father, his father would die.\r\n\r\n44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother\r\ncome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\r\n\r\n44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,\r\nwe told him the words of my lord.\r\n\r\n44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\r\n\r\n44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with\r\nus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, except\r\nour youngest brother be with us.\r\n\r\n44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\r\nbare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,\r\nSurely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if ye\r\ntake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down\r\nmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\r\n\r\n44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad\r\nbe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad\xe2\x80\x99s life;\r\n44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\r\nus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs\r\nof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\r\n\r\n44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\r\nsaying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to\r\nmy father for ever.\r\n\r\n44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the\r\nlad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\r\n\r\n44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?\r\nlest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.\r\n\r\n45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood\r\nby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there\r\nstood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\r\nyet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\r\ntroubled at his presence.\r\n\r\n45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.\r\nAnd they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye\r\nsold into Egypt.\r\n\r\n45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye\r\nsold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\r\n\r\n45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet\r\nthere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the\r\nearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\r\n\r\n45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath\r\nmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler\r\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith\r\nthy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,\r\ntarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou\r\nshalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11\r\nAnd there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;\r\nlest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.\r\n\r\n45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,\r\nthat it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\r\n\r\n45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all\r\nthat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.\r\n\r\n45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and wept; and\r\nBenjamin wept upon his neck.\r\n\r\n45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\r\nafter that his brethren talked with him.\r\n\r\n45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s house, saying,\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;\r\nlade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 And\r\ntake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will\r\ngive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the\r\nland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your\r\nfather, and come.\r\n\r\n45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of\r\nEgypt is yours.\r\n\r\n45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,\r\naccording to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\r\nBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of\r\nraiment.\r\n\r\n45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden\r\nwith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and\r\nbread and meat for his father by the way.\r\n\r\n45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said\r\nunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\r\n\r\n45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan\r\nunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet\r\nalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart fainted, for he believed them not.\r\n\r\n45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said\r\nunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry\r\nhim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,\r\nIt is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before\r\nI die.\r\n\r\n46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to\r\nBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.\r\n\r\n46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,\r\nJacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\r\n\r\n46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down\r\ninto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I will\r\ngo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\r\nagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\r\n\r\n46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried\r\nJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the\r\nwagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\r\n\r\n46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had\r\ngotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his\r\nseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99 sons with him, his\r\ndaughters, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99 daughters, and all his seed brought he with\r\nhim into Egypt.\r\n\r\n46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\r\ninto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s firstborn.\r\n\r\n46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and\r\nCarmi.\r\n\r\n46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,\r\nand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\r\n\r\n46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\r\n\r\n46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and\r\nZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of\r\nPharez were Hezron and Hamul.\r\n\r\n46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and\r\nShimron.\r\n\r\n46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.\r\n\r\n46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in\r\nPadanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his\r\ndaughters were thirty and three.\r\n\r\n46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,\r\nand Arodi, and Areli.\r\n\r\n46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,\r\nand Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.\r\n\r\n46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his\r\ndaughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.\r\n\r\n46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.\r\n\r\n46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and\r\nEphraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\n46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,\r\nGera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\r\n\r\n46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the\r\nsouls were fourteen.\r\n\r\n46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.\r\n\r\n46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and\r\nShillem.\r\n\r\n46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his\r\ndaughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.\r\n\r\n46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of\r\nhis loins, besides Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s sons\xe2\x80\x99 wives, all the souls were threescore\r\nand six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,\r\nwere two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into\r\nEgypt, were threescore and ten.\r\n\r\n46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face\r\nunto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.\r\n\r\n46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel\r\nhis father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on\r\nhis neck, and wept on his neck a good while.\r\n\r\n46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen\r\nthy face, because thou art yet alive.\r\n\r\n46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nI will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;\r\n46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed\r\ncattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all\r\nthat they have.\r\n\r\n46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and\r\nshall say, What is your occupation?  46:34 That ye shall say, Thy\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,\r\nboth we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of\r\nGoshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my\r\nbrethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,\r\nare come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land\r\nof Goshen.\r\n\r\n47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented\r\nthem unto Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And\r\nthey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also\r\nour fathers.\r\n\r\n47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we\r\ncome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the\r\nfamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let\r\nthy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\r\n\r\n47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy\r\nbrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in\r\nthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the\r\nland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity\r\namong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.\r\n\r\n47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before\r\nPharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacob\r\nsaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an\r\nhundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of\r\nmy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the\r\nlife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a\r\npossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land\r\nof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\r\n\r\n47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s household, with bread, according to their families.\r\n\r\n47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very\r\nsore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by\r\nreason of the famine.\r\n\r\n47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land\r\nof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:\r\nand Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\r\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:\r\nfor why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.\r\n\r\n47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your\r\ncattle, if money fail.\r\n\r\n47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them\r\nbread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle\r\nof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all\r\ntheir cattle for that year.\r\n\r\n47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,\r\nand said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our\r\nmoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not\r\nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\r\n47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?\r\nbuy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants\r\nunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that\r\nthe land be not desolate.\r\n\r\n47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the\r\nEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over\r\nthem: so the land became Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of\r\nthe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\r\n\r\n47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had\r\na portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which\r\nPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\r\n\r\n47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this\r\nday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall\r\nsow the land.\r\n\r\n47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give\r\nthe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\r\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\r\nand for food for your little ones.\r\n\r\n47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in\r\nthe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s servants.\r\n\r\n47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,\r\nthat Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the\r\npriests only, which became not Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;\r\nand they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the\r\nwhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.\r\n\r\n47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his\r\nson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,\r\nput, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly\r\nwith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie with\r\nmy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their\r\nburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.\r\n\r\n47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel\r\nbowed himself upon the bed\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,\r\nBehold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,\r\nManasseh and Ephraim.\r\n\r\n48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto\r\nthee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\r\n\r\n48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz\r\nin the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,\r\nI will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee\r\na multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee\r\nfor an everlasting possession.\r\n\r\n48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto\r\nthee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are\r\nmine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\r\n\r\n48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,\r\nand shall be called after the name of their brethren in their\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the\r\nland of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come\r\nunto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same\r\nis Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9\r\nAnd Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given\r\nme in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I\r\nwill bless them.\r\n\r\n48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nAnd he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:\r\nand, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\r\n\r\n48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed\r\nhimself with his face to the earth.\r\n\r\n48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\r\nIsrael\xe2\x80\x99s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright hand, and brought them near unto him.\r\n\r\n48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\r\nEphraim\xe2\x80\x99s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.\r\n\r\n48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\r\nAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto\r\nthis day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the\r\nlads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers\r\nAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the\r\nhead of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nto remove it from Ephraim\xe2\x80\x99s head unto Manasseh\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is\r\nthe firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\r\n\r\n48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:\r\nhe also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly\r\nhis younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall\r\nbecome a multitude of nations.\r\n\r\n48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel\r\nbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set\r\nEphraim before Manasseh.\r\n\r\n48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be\r\nwith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\r\n\r\n48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,\r\nwhich I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves\r\ntogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and\r\nhearken unto Israel your father.\r\n\r\n49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my\r\nstrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4\r\nUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to\r\nthy father\xe2\x80\x99s bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.\r\n\r\n49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,\r\nmine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,\r\nand in their selfwill they digged down a wall.\r\n\r\n49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it\r\nwas cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.\r\n\r\n49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall\r\nbe in the neck of thine enemies; thy father\xe2\x80\x99s children shall bow down\r\nbefore thee.\r\n\r\n49:9 Judah is a lion\xe2\x80\x99s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:\r\nhe stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall\r\nrouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a\r\nlawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall\r\nthe gathering of the people be.\r\n\r\n49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass\xe2\x80\x99s colt unto the\r\nchoice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the\r\nblood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth\r\nwhite with milk.\r\n\r\n49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for\r\nan haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\r\n\r\n49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:\r\n49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was\r\npleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\n49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that\r\nbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\r\n\r\n49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.\r\n\r\n49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal\r\ndainties.\r\n\r\n49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.\r\n\r\n49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;\r\nwhose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorely\r\ngrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abode\r\nin strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands\r\nof the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of\r\nIsrael:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and\r\nby the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,\r\nblessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and\r\nof the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above\r\nthe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the\r\neverlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the\r\ncrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\r\n\r\n49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour\r\nthe prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.\r\n\r\n49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that\r\ntheir father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to\r\nhis blessing he blessed them.\r\n\r\n49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered\r\nunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the\r\nfield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of\r\nMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham\r\nbought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a\r\nburyingplace.\r\n\r\n49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried\r\nIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\r\n\r\n49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was\r\nfrom the children of Heth.\r\n\r\n49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he\r\ngathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was\r\ngathered unto his people.\r\n\r\n50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father\xe2\x80\x99s face, and wept upon him, and\r\nkissed him.\r\n\r\n50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his\r\nfather: and the physicians embalmed Israel.\r\n\r\n50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the\r\ndays of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him\r\nthreescore and ten days.\r\n\r\n50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto\r\nthe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,\r\nspeak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made\r\nme swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in\r\nthe land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go\r\nup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.\r\n\r\n50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he\r\nmade thee swear.\r\n\r\n50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all\r\nthe servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders\r\nof the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his\r\nbrethren, and his father\xe2\x80\x99s house: only their little ones, and their\r\nflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.\r\n\r\n50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was\r\na very great company.\r\n\r\n50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond\r\nJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:\r\nand he made a mourning for his father seven days.\r\n\r\n50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the\r\nmourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning\r\nto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,\r\nwhich is beyond Jordan.\r\n\r\n50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13\r\nFor his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in\r\nthe cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the\r\nfield for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before\r\nMamre.\r\n\r\n50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all\r\nthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n50:15 And when Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s brethren saw that their father was dead, they\r\nsaid, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us\r\nall the evil which we did unto him.\r\n\r\n50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did\r\ncommand before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,\r\nForgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;\r\nfor they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the\r\ntrespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept\r\nwhen they spake unto him.\r\n\r\n50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and\r\nthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.\r\n\r\n50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of\r\nGod?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant\r\nit unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little\r\nones.\r\n\r\nAnd he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\r\n\r\n50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father\xe2\x80\x99s house: and\r\nJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.\r\n\r\n50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim\xe2\x80\x99s children of the third generation: the\r\nchildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s knees.\r\n\r\n50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely\r\nvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware\r\nto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\r\n\r\n50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God\r\nwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.\r\n\r\n50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they\r\nembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\r\ninto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.\r\n\r\n1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and\r\nBenjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\r\n\r\n1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy\r\nsouls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\r\n\r\n1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\r\n\r\n1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased\r\nabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land\r\nwas filled with them.\r\n\r\n1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\r\n\r\n1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of\r\nIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wisely\r\nwith them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there\r\nfalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight\r\nagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.\r\n\r\n1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with\r\ntheir burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and\r\nRaamses.\r\n\r\n1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\nAnd they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with\r\nrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in\r\nmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all\r\ntheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.\r\n\r\n1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the\r\nname of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 And\r\nhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and\r\nsee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but\r\nif it be a daughter, then she shall live.\r\n\r\n1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt\r\ncommanded them, but saved the men children alive.\r\n\r\n1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto\r\nthem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children\r\nalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew\r\nwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are\r\ndelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.\r\n\r\n1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people\r\nmultiplied, and waxed very mighty.\r\n\r\n1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he\r\nmade them houses.\r\n\r\n1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is\r\nborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a\r\ndaughter of Levi.\r\n\r\n2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that\r\nhe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.\r\n\r\n2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of\r\nbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child\r\ntherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river\xe2\x80\x99s brink.\r\n\r\n2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.\r\n\r\n2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the\r\nriver; and her maidens walked along by the river\xe2\x80\x99s side; and when she\r\nsaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.\r\n\r\n2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the\r\nbabe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the\r\nHebrews\xe2\x80\x99 children.\r\n\r\n2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Shall I go and call to\r\nthee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for\r\nthee?  2:8 And Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went\r\nand called the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\n2:9 And Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and\r\nnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took\r\nthe child, and nursed it.\r\n\r\n2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nand he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,\r\nBecause I drew him out of the water.\r\n\r\n2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he\r\nwent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied\r\nan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.\r\n\r\n2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there\r\nwas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.\r\n\r\n2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the\r\nHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,\r\nWherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee a\r\nprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou\r\nkilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing\r\nis known.\r\n\r\n2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But\r\nMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:\r\nand he sat down by a well.\r\n\r\n2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and\r\ndrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father\xe2\x80\x99s flock.\r\n\r\n2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up\r\nand helped them, and watered their flock.\r\n\r\n2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that\r\nye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered\r\nus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for\r\nus, and watered the flock.\r\n\r\n2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that\r\nye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.\r\n\r\n2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses\r\nZipporah his daughter.\r\n\r\n2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he\r\nsaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\r\n\r\n2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt\r\ndied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and\r\nthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.\r\n\r\n2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant\r\nwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\r\n\r\n2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect\r\nunto them.\r\n\r\n3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest\r\nof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and\r\ncame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.\r\n\r\n3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out\r\nof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned\r\nwith fire, and the bush was not consumed.\r\n\r\n3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,\r\nwhy the bush is not burnt.\r\n\r\n3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto\r\nhim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,\r\nHere am I.\r\n\r\n3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy\r\nfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\r\n\r\n3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,\r\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he\r\nwas afraid to look upon God.\r\n\r\n3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people\r\nwhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their\r\ntaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down to\r\ndeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up\r\nout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing\r\nwith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the\r\nHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and\r\nthe Jebusites.\r\n\r\n3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come\r\nunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians\r\noppress them.\r\n\r\n3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou\r\nmayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,\r\nand that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\r\n3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a\r\ntoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth\r\nthe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\r\n\r\n3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of\r\nIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me\r\nunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say\r\nunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,\r\nThus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me\r\nunto you.\r\n\r\n3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,\r\nthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is\r\nmy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\r\n\r\n3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,\r\nThe LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of\r\nJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen\r\nthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bring\r\nyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,\r\nand the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the\r\nHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.\r\n\r\n3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou\r\nand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say\r\nunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us\r\ngo, we beseech thee, three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey into the wilderness, that we\r\nmay sacrifice to the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not\r\nby a mighty hand.\r\n\r\n3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my\r\nwonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will\r\nlet you go.\r\n\r\n3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:\r\nand it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.\r\n\r\n3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that\r\nsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and\r\nraiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your\r\ndaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe\r\nme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not\r\nappeared unto thee.\r\n\r\n4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he\r\nsaid, A rod.\r\n\r\n4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,\r\nand it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.\r\n\r\n4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by\r\nthe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a\r\nrod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their\r\nfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,\r\nhath appeared unto thee.\r\n\r\n4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into\r\nthy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it\r\nout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.\r\n\r\n4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his\r\nhand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,\r\nbehold, it was turned again as his other flesh.\r\n\r\n4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither\r\nhearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the\r\nvoice of the latter sign.\r\n\r\n4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two\r\nsigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the\r\nwater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which\r\nthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\r\n\r\n4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,\r\nneither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I\r\nam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\r\n\r\n4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man\xe2\x80\x99s mouth? or who\r\nmaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the\r\nLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach\r\nthee what thou shalt say.\r\n\r\n4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him\r\nwhom thou wilt send.\r\n\r\n4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,\r\nIs not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.\r\nAnd also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth\r\nthee, he will be glad in his heart.\r\n\r\n4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I\r\nwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye\r\nshall do.\r\n\r\n4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,\r\neven he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him\r\ninstead of God.\r\n\r\n4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt\r\ndo signs.\r\n\r\n4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said\r\nunto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which\r\nare in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to\r\nMoses, Go in peace.\r\n\r\n4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:\r\nfor all the men are dead which sought thy life.\r\n\r\n4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,\r\nand he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into\r\nEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have\r\nput in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let\r\nthe people go.\r\n\r\n4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is\r\nmy son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,\r\nthat he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will\r\nslay thy son, even thy firstborn.\r\n\r\n4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,\r\nand sought to kill him.\r\n\r\n4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her\r\nson, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art\r\nthou to me.\r\n\r\n4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,\r\nbecause of the circumcision.\r\n\r\n4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\r\nAnd he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.\r\n\r\n4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,\r\nand all the signs which he had commanded him.\r\n\r\n4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of\r\nthe children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which the\r\nLORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had\r\nvisited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their\r\naffliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.\r\n\r\n5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a\r\nfeast unto me in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to\r\nlet Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\r\n\r\n5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,\r\nwe pray thee, three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto\r\nthe LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and\r\nAaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.\r\n\r\n5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and\r\nye make them rest from their burdens.\r\n\r\n5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,\r\nand their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw\r\nto make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye\r\nshall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be\r\nidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\r\n\r\n5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour\r\ntherein; and let them not regard vain words.\r\n\r\n5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,\r\nand they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not\r\ngive you straw.\r\n\r\n5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your\r\nwork shall be diminished.\r\n\r\n5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of\r\nEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.\r\n\r\n5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your\r\ndaily tasks, as when there was straw.\r\n\r\n5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore\r\nhave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to\r\nday, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel\r\ncame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with\r\nthy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and\r\nthey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but\r\nthe fault is in thine own people.\r\n\r\n5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us\r\ngo and do sacrifice to the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given\r\nyou, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.\r\n\r\n5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were\r\nin evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your\r\nbricks of your daily task.\r\n\r\n5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came\r\nforth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon\r\nyou, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the\r\neyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in\r\ntheir hand to slay us.\r\n\r\n5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast\r\nthou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?\r\n5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done\r\nevil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.\r\n\r\n6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do\r\nto Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a\r\nstrong hand shall he drive them out of his land.\r\n\r\n6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3\r\nAnd I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name\r\nof God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.\r\n\r\n6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them\r\nthe land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom\r\nthe Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.\r\n\r\n6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I\r\nwill bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will\r\nrid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched\r\nout arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for a\r\npeople, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the\r\nLORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did\r\nswear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give\r\nit you for an heritage: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened\r\nnot unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.\r\n\r\n6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak unto\r\nPharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of\r\nhis land.\r\n\r\n6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of\r\nIsrael have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who\r\nam of uncircumcised lips?  6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto\r\nAaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto\r\nPharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\n6:14 These be the heads of their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 houses: The sons of Reuben\r\nthe firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these\r\nbe the families of Reuben.\r\n\r\n6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,\r\nand Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the\r\nfamilies of Simeon.\r\n\r\n6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their\r\ngenerations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the\r\nlife of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.\r\n\r\n6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:\r\nand the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families\r\nof Levi according to their generations.\r\n\r\n6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father\xe2\x80\x99s sister to wife; and she\r\nbare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an\r\nhundred and thirty and seven years.\r\n\r\n6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.\r\n\r\n6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.\r\n\r\n6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of\r\nNaashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and\r\nIthamar.\r\n\r\n6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these\r\nare the families of the Korhites.\r\n\r\n6:25 And Eleazar Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel\r\nto wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers\r\nof the Levites according to their families.\r\n\r\n6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out\r\nthe children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their\r\narmies.\r\n\r\n6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out\r\nthe children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.\r\n\r\n6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in\r\nthe land of Egypt, 6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am\r\nthe LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised\r\nlips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  7:1 And the LORD said\r\nunto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy\r\nbrother shall be thy prophet.\r\n\r\n7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother\r\nshall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of\r\nhis land.\r\n\r\n7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and multiply my signs and my\r\nwonders in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand\r\nupon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of\r\nIsrael, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.\r\n\r\n7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch\r\nforth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.\r\n\r\n7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three\r\nyears old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 When\r\nPharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then\r\nthou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,\r\nand it shall become a serpent.\r\n\r\n7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the\r\nLORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and\r\nbefore his servants, and it became a serpent.\r\n\r\n7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the\r\nmagicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their\r\nenchantments.\r\n\r\n7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:\r\nbut Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s rod swallowed up their rods.\r\n\r\n7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart, that he hearkened not unto them;\r\nas the LORD had said.\r\n\r\n7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart is hardened, he\r\nrefuseth to let the people go.\r\n\r\n7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the\r\nwater; and thou shalt stand by the river\xe2\x80\x99s brink against he come; and\r\nthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.\r\n\r\n7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath\r\nsent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in\r\nthe wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.\r\n\r\n7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:\r\nbehold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters\r\nwhich are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\r\n\r\n7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall\r\nstink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and\r\nstretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,\r\nupon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of\r\nwater, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood\r\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in\r\nvessels of stone.\r\n\r\n7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted\r\nup the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight\r\nof Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that\r\nwere in the river were turned to blood.\r\n\r\n7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and\r\nthe Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was\r\nblood throughout all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and\r\nPharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the\r\nLORD had said.\r\n\r\n7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set\r\nhis heart to this also.\r\n\r\n7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to\r\ndrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\r\n\r\n7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,\r\nThus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\r\n\r\n8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy\r\nborders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs\r\nabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy\r\nbedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and\r\nupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:\r\n8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and\r\nupon all thy servants.\r\n\r\n8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine\r\nhand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the\r\nponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the\r\nfrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up\r\nfrogs upon the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the\r\nLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and\r\nI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat\r\nfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the\r\nfrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river\r\nonly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to\r\nthy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD\r\nour God.\r\n\r\n8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and\r\nfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto\r\nthe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs\r\ndied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.\r\n\r\n8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.\r\n\r\n8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his\r\nheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\r\n\r\n8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy\r\nrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice\r\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,\r\nand smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in\r\nbeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth\r\nlice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.\r\n\r\n8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:\r\nand Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as\r\nthe LORD had said.\r\n\r\n8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\r\nstand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto\r\nhim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\r\n\r\n8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send\r\nswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,\r\nand into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of\r\nswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.\r\n\r\n8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my\r\npeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou\r\nmayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.\r\n\r\n8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to\r\nmorrow shall this sign be.\r\n\r\n8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies\r\ninto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants\xe2\x80\x99 houses, and into all\r\nthe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of\r\nflies.\r\n\r\n8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,\r\nsacrifice to your God in the land.\r\n\r\n8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice\r\nthe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we\r\nsacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will\r\nthey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey into the\r\nwilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.\r\n\r\n8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the\r\nLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:\r\nintreat for me.\r\n\r\n8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat\r\nthe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his\r\nservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal\r\ndeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed\r\nthe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his\r\npeople; there remained not one.\r\n\r\n8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would\r\nhe let the people go.\r\n\r\n9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,\r\nThus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they\r\nmay serve me.\r\n\r\n9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3\r\nBehold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,\r\nupon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and\r\nupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\r\n\r\n9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the\r\ncattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s of Israel.\r\n\r\n9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD\r\nshall do this thing in the land.\r\n\r\n9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of\r\nEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\r\n\r\n9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of\r\nthe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did\r\nnot let the people go.\r\n\r\n9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls\r\nof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven\r\nin the sight of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall\r\nbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,\r\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and\r\nMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking\r\nforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.\r\n\r\n9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the\r\nboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not\r\nunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.\r\n\r\n9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and\r\nstand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the\r\nHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.\r\n\r\n9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and\r\nupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that\r\nthere is none like me in all the earth.\r\n\r\n9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy\r\npeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.\r\n\r\n9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to\r\nshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt\r\nnot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause\r\nit to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since\r\nthe foundation thereof even until now.\r\n\r\n9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast\r\nin the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the\r\nfield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon\r\nthem, and they shall die.\r\n\r\n9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh\r\nmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And he\r\nthat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his\r\ncattle in the field.\r\n\r\n9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward\r\nheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and\r\nupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD\r\nsent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the\r\nLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,\r\nsuch as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it\r\nbecame a nation.\r\n\r\n9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was\r\nin the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the\r\nfield, and brake every tree of the field.\r\n\r\n9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,\r\nwas there no hail.\r\n\r\n9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto\r\nthem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my\r\npeople are wicked.\r\n\r\n9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty\r\nthunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I\r\nwill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall\r\ncease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how\r\nthat the earth is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet\r\nfear the LORD God.\r\n\r\n9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in\r\nthe ear, and the flax was bolled.\r\n\r\n9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not\r\ngrown up.\r\n\r\n9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad\r\nhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the\r\nrain was not poured upon the earth.\r\n\r\n9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders\r\nwere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the\r\nchildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\r\n\r\n10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have\r\nhardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew\r\nthese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears\r\nof thy son, and of thy son\xe2\x80\x99s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,\r\nand my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I\r\nam the LORD.\r\n\r\n10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble\r\nthyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.\r\n\r\n10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will\r\nI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the face\r\nof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall\r\neat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you\r\nfrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of\r\nthe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all\r\nthy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy\r\nfathers, nor thy fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fathers have seen, since the day that they\r\nwere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out\r\nfrom Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n10:7 And Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be\r\na snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their\r\nGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses and\r\nAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,\r\nserve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 And\r\nMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons\r\nand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;\r\nfor we must hold a feast unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will\r\nlet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\r\n\r\n10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye\r\ndid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\r\nland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of\r\nEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and\r\nthe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that\r\nnight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.\r\n\r\n10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in\r\nall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there\r\nwere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\r\n\r\n10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land\r\nwas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the\r\nfruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any\r\ngreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all\r\nthe land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I\r\nhave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.\r\n\r\n10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and\r\nintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.\r\n\r\n10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away\r\nthe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one\r\nlocust in all the coasts of Egypt.\r\n\r\n10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart, so that he would not let\r\nthe children of Israel go.\r\n\r\n10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward\r\nheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even\r\ndarkness which may be felt.\r\n\r\n10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was\r\na thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They saw\r\nnot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but\r\nall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\r\n\r\n10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;\r\nonly let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones\r\nalso go with you.\r\n\r\n10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt\r\nofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be\r\nleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and\r\nwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.\r\n\r\n10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and he would not let them\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to\r\nthyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou\r\nshalt die.\r\n\r\n10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more\r\nupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:\r\nwhen he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of\r\nhis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and\r\njewels of gold.\r\n\r\n11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\nMoreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the\r\nsight of Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and in the sight of the people.\r\n\r\n11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out\r\ninto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of\r\nEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his\r\nthrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the\r\nmill; and all the firstborn of beasts.\r\n\r\n11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,\r\nsuch as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.\r\n\r\n11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move\r\nhis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD\r\ndoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\r\n\r\n11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down\r\nthemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that\r\nfollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from\r\nPharaoh in a great anger.\r\n\r\n11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;\r\nthat my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and\r\nthe LORD hardened Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart, so that he would not let the\r\nchildren of Israel go out of his land.\r\n\r\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt\r\nsaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it\r\nshall be the first month of the year to you.\r\n\r\n12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the\r\ntenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,\r\naccording to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 And\r\nif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour\r\nnext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;\r\nevery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.\r\n\r\n12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye\r\nshall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shall\r\nkeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole\r\nassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.\r\n\r\n12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side\r\nposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat\r\nit.\r\n\r\n12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and\r\nunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\r\n\r\n12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with\r\nfire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.\r\n\r\n12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and\r\nthat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.\r\n\r\n12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on\r\nyour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:\r\nit is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s passover.\r\n\r\n12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will\r\nsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and\r\nagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where\r\nye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague\r\nshall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep\r\nit a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a\r\nfeast by an ordinance for ever.\r\n\r\n12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye\r\nshall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth\r\nleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul\r\nshall be cut off from Israel.\r\n\r\n12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in\r\nthe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner\r\nof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,\r\nthat only may be done of you.\r\n\r\n12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this\r\nselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:\r\ntherefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an\r\nordinance for ever.\r\n\r\n12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,\r\nye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the\r\nmonth at even.\r\n\r\n12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for\r\nwhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut\r\noff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\n12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye\r\neat unleavened bread.\r\n\r\n12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto\r\nthem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and\r\nkill the passover.\r\n\r\n12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood\r\nthat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts\r\nwith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at\r\nthe door of his house until the morning.\r\n\r\n12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when\r\nhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the\r\nLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to\r\ncome in unto your houses to smite you.\r\n\r\n12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to\r\nthy sons for ever.\r\n\r\n12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the\r\nLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep\r\nthis service.\r\n\r\n12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto\r\nyou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is the\r\nsacrifice of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s passover, who passed over the houses of the\r\nchildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and\r\ndelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.\r\n\r\n12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had\r\ncommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\r\n\r\n12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the\r\nfirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat\r\non his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the\r\ndungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\r\n\r\n12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and\r\nall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was\r\nnot a house where there was not one dead.\r\n\r\n12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,\r\nand get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of\r\nIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.\r\n\r\n12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be\r\ngone; and bless me also.\r\n\r\n12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might\r\nsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.\r\n\r\n12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their\r\nkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\r\n\r\n12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;\r\nand they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of\r\ngold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the\r\nsight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as\r\nthey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,\r\nabout six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.\r\n\r\n12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and\r\nherds, even very much cattle.\r\n\r\n12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought\r\nforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust\r\nout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for\r\nthemselves any victual.\r\n\r\n12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in\r\nEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\r\n\r\n12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty\r\nyears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of\r\nthe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing\r\nthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be\r\nobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.\r\n\r\n12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of\r\nthe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But every\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised\r\nhim, then shall he eat thereof.\r\n\r\n12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.\r\n\r\n12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought\r\nof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.\r\n\r\n12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the\r\npassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let\r\nhim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the\r\nland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.\r\n\r\n12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger\r\nthat sojourneth among you.\r\n\r\n12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses\r\nand Aaron, so did they.\r\n\r\n12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring\r\nthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\r\n\r\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all\r\nthe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of\r\nIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\r\n\r\n13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye\r\ncame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of\r\nhand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened\r\nbread be eaten.\r\n\r\n13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.\r\n\r\n13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\r\nthe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,\r\nand the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a\r\nland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in\r\nthis month.\r\n\r\n13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh\r\nday shall be a feast to the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no\r\nleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen\r\nwith thee in all thy quarters.\r\n\r\n13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done\r\nbecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a\r\nmemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s law may be in thy mouth:\r\nfor with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year\r\nto year.\r\n\r\n13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of\r\nthe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall\r\ngive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that\r\nopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which\r\nthou hast; the males shall be the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and\r\nif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all\r\nthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.\r\n\r\n13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,\r\nsaying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of\r\nhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:\r\n13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that\r\nthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the\r\nfirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to\r\nthe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the\r\nfirstborn of my children I redeem.\r\n\r\n13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets\r\nbetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth\r\nout of Egypt.\r\n\r\n13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that\r\nGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,\r\nalthough that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people\r\nrepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God led\r\nthe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:\r\nand the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly\r\nsworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and\r\nye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\r\n\r\n13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,\r\nin the edge of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to\r\nlead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them\r\nlight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar of\r\nthe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,\r\nbetween Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall\r\nye encamp by the sea.\r\n\r\n14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are\r\nentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\r\n\r\n14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s heart, that he shall follow after\r\nthem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that\r\nthe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\r\n\r\n14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the\r\nheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,\r\nand they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from\r\nserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people\r\nwith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the\r\nchariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.\r\n\r\n14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he\r\npursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went\r\nout with an high hand.\r\n\r\n14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots\r\nof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them\r\nencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.\r\n\r\n14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up\r\ntheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they\r\nwere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,\r\nhast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou\r\ndealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not this\r\nthe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we\r\nmay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the\r\nEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and\r\nsee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for\r\nthe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no\r\nmore for ever.\r\n\r\n14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\r\n\r\n14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?\r\nspeak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 But\r\nlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and\r\ndivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through\r\nthe midst of the sea.\r\n\r\n14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and\r\nthey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and\r\nupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\r\n\r\n14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have\r\ngotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\n14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,\r\nremoved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from\r\nbefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between\r\nthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud\r\nand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the\r\none came not near the other all the night.\r\n\r\n14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD\r\ncaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and\r\nmade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\r\n\r\n14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon\r\nthe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right\r\nhand, and on their left.\r\n\r\n14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst\r\nof the sea, even all Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\r\n\r\n14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked\r\nunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the\r\ncloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took off\r\ntheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the\r\nEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD\r\nfighteth for them against the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the\r\nsea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their\r\nchariots, and upon their horsemen.\r\n\r\n14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea\r\nreturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians\r\nfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the\r\nhorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after\r\nthem; there remained not so much as one of them.\r\n\r\n14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of\r\nthe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and\r\non their left.\r\n\r\n14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the\r\nEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.\r\n\r\n14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the\r\nEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and\r\nhis servant Moses.\r\n\r\n15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the\r\nLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath\r\ntriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:\r\nhe is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father\xe2\x80\x99s God,\r\nand I will exalt him.\r\n\r\n15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.\r\n\r\n15:4 Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his\r\nchosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.\r\n\r\n15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right\r\nhand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\r\n\r\n15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown\r\nthem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which\r\nconsumed them as stubble.\r\n\r\n15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered\r\ntogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were\r\ncongealed in the heart of the sea.\r\n\r\n15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the\r\nspoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my\r\nhand shall destroy them.\r\n\r\n15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank\r\nas lead in the mighty waters.\r\n\r\n15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,\r\nglorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thou\r\nstretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.\r\n\r\n15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast\r\nredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\n15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on\r\nthe inhabitants of Palestina.\r\n\r\n15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,\r\ntrembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan\r\nshall melt away.\r\n\r\n15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine\r\narm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O\r\nLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.\r\n\r\n15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of\r\nthine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee\r\nto dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his\r\nhorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the\r\nsea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the\r\nmidst of the sea.\r\n\r\n15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel\r\nin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and\r\nwith dances.\r\n\r\n15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath\r\ntriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into\r\nthe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,\r\nand found no water.\r\n\r\n15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters\r\nof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called\r\nMarah.\r\n\r\n15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we\r\ndrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a\r\ntree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made\r\nsweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he\r\nproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the\r\nvoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his\r\nsight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his\r\nstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have\r\nbrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.\r\n\r\n15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and\r\nthreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.\r\n\r\n16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation\r\nof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is\r\nbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after\r\ntheir departing out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured\r\nagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children of\r\nIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the\r\nLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we\r\ndid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this\r\nwilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\r\n\r\n16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from\r\nheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate\r\nevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or\r\nno.\r\n\r\n16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall\r\nprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as\r\nthey gather daily.\r\n\r\n16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At\r\neven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the\r\nland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of\r\nthe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and\r\nwhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, This\r\nshall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,\r\nand in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your\r\nmurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your\r\nmurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the\r\nchildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your\r\nmurmurings.\r\n\r\n16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation\r\nof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,\r\nand, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\r\n\r\n16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the\r\nmurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even\r\nye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;\r\nand ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and\r\ncovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.\r\n\r\n16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of\r\nthe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar\r\nfrost on the ground.\r\n\r\n16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to\r\nanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said\r\nunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.\r\n\r\n16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it\r\nevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to\r\nthe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in\r\nhis tents.\r\n\r\n16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some\r\nless.\r\n\r\n16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much\r\nhad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they\r\ngathered every man according to his eating.\r\n\r\n16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.\r\n\r\n16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them\r\nleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses\r\nwas wroth with them.\r\n\r\n16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his\r\neating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.\r\n\r\n16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice\r\nas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the\r\ncongregation came and told Moses.\r\n\r\n16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To\r\nmorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which\r\nye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which\r\nremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\r\n\r\n16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did\r\nnot stink, neither was there any worm therein.\r\n\r\n16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto\r\nthe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.\r\n\r\n16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is\r\nthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.\r\n\r\n16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on\r\nthe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.\r\n\r\n16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my\r\ncommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you\r\nthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two\r\ndays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place\r\non the seventh day.\r\n\r\n16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\r\n\r\n16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it\r\nwas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers\r\nmade with honey.\r\n\r\n16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,\r\nFill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see\r\nthe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought\r\nyou forth from the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of\r\nmanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the\r\nTestimony, to be kept.\r\n\r\n16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they\r\ncame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the\r\nborders of the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.\r\n\r\n17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from\r\nthe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the\r\ncommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no\r\nwater for the people to drink.\r\n\r\n17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us\r\nwater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with\r\nme? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirsted\r\nthere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,\r\nWherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill\r\nus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses cried\r\nunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be\r\nalmost ready to stone me.\r\n\r\n17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take\r\nwith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest\r\nthe river, take in thine hand, and go.\r\n\r\n17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;\r\nand thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,\r\nthat the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because\r\nof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the\r\nLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,\r\nand fought with Israel in Rephidim.\r\n\r\n17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight\r\nwith Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the\r\nrod of God in mine hand.\r\n\r\n17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:\r\nand Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\r\n\r\n17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel\r\nprevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\r\n\r\n17:12 But Moses\xe2\x80\x99 hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it\r\nunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,\r\nthe one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his\r\nhands were steady until the going down of the sun.\r\n\r\n17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\n17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a\r\nbook, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put\r\nout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.\r\n\r\n17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it\r\nJehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the\r\nLORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law, heard of\r\nall that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that\r\nthe LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfather in law, took Zipporah, Moses\xe2\x80\x99 wife, after he had sent her back,\r\n18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for\r\nhe said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name of\r\nthe other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine\r\nhelp, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,\r\nMoses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into\r\nthe wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And he\r\nsaid unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy\r\nwife, and her two sons with her.\r\n\r\n18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,\r\nand kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they\r\ncame into the tent.\r\n\r\n18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto\r\nPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and all the travail\r\nthat had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.\r\n\r\n18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done\r\nto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out\r\nof the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath\r\ndelivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the\r\nthing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.\r\n\r\n18:12 And Jethro, Moses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law, took a burnt offering and\r\nsacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to\r\neat bread with Moses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law before God.\r\n\r\n18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the\r\npeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n18:14 And when Moses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law saw all that he did to the people,\r\nhe said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest\r\nthou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto\r\neven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people\r\ncome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, they\r\ncome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them\r\nknow the statutes of God, and his laws.\r\n\r\n18:17 And Moses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law said unto him, The thing that thou\r\ndoest is not good.\r\n\r\n18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is\r\nwith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to\r\nperform it thyself alone.\r\n\r\n18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God\r\nshall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou\r\nmayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach them\r\nordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must\r\nwalk, and the work that they must do.\r\n\r\n18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such\r\nas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over\r\nthem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of\r\nfifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people at\r\nall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring\r\nunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be\r\neasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.\r\n\r\n18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou\r\nshalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their\r\nplace in peace.\r\n\r\n18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did\r\nall that he had said.\r\n\r\n18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads\r\nover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of\r\nfifties, and rulers of tens.\r\n\r\n18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they\r\nbrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\r\n\r\n18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into\r\nhis own land.\r\n\r\n19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth\r\nout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness\r\nof Sinai.\r\n\r\n19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert\r\nof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped\r\nbefore the mount.\r\n\r\n19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of\r\nthe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and\r\ntell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto the\r\nEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles\xe2\x80\x99 wings, and brought you unto\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my\r\ncovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all\r\npeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a\r\nkingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\r\n\r\nThese are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid\r\nbefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.\r\n\r\n19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD\r\nhath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people\r\nunto the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick\r\ncloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe\r\nthee for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify\r\nthem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 And\r\nbe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come\r\ndown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.\r\n\r\n19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,\r\nTake heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch\r\nthe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to\r\ndeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be\r\nstoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not\r\nlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\r\n\r\n19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and\r\nsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.\r\n\r\n19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:\r\ncome not at your wives.\r\n\r\n19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there\r\nwere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and\r\nthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that\r\nwas in the camp trembled.\r\n\r\n19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with\r\nGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.\r\n\r\n19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD\r\ndescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke\r\nof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\r\n\r\n19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder\r\nand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\r\n\r\n19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the\r\nmount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses\r\nwent up.\r\n\r\n19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest\r\nthey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.\r\n\r\n19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify\r\nthemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.\r\n\r\n19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount\r\nSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and\r\nsanctify it.\r\n\r\n19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt\r\ncome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the\r\npeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.\r\n\r\n20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy\r\nGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the\r\nhouse of bondage.\r\n\r\n20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\r\n\r\n20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\r\nof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,\r\nor that is in the water under the earth.\r\n\r\n20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I\r\nthe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the\r\nfathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them\r\nthat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love\r\nme, and keep my commandments.\r\n\r\n20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the\r\nLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\r\n\r\n20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\r\n\r\n20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the\r\nseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not\r\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor\r\nthy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy\r\ngates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,\r\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the\r\nLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\r\n\r\n20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon\r\nthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\r\n\r\n20:13 Thou shalt not kill.\r\n\r\n20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.\r\n\r\n20:15 Thou shalt not steal.\r\n\r\n20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\r\n\r\n20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house, thou shalt not covet\r\nthy neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his\r\nox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and\r\nthe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the\r\npeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\r\n\r\n20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:\r\nbut let not God speak with us, lest we die.\r\n\r\n20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to\r\nprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the\r\nthick darkness where God was.\r\n\r\n20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make\r\nunto you gods of gold.\r\n\r\n20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice\r\nthereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and\r\nthine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto\r\nthee, and I will bless thee.\r\n\r\n20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build\r\nit of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast\r\npolluted it.\r\n\r\n20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy\r\nnakedness be not discovered thereon.\r\n\r\n21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.\r\n\r\n21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in\r\nthe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.\r\n\r\n21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were\r\nmarried, then his wife shall go out with him.\r\n\r\n21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons\r\nor daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\r\nshall go out by himself.\r\n\r\n21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,\r\nand my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shall\r\nbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or\r\nunto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an\r\naul; and he shall serve him for ever.\r\n\r\n21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not\r\ngo out as the menservants do.\r\n\r\n21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,\r\nthen shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation\r\nhe shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.\r\n\r\n21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her\r\nafter the manner of daughters.\r\n\r\n21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty\r\nof marriage, shall he not diminish.\r\n\r\n21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out\r\nfree without money.\r\n\r\n21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;\r\nthen I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.\r\n\r\n21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him\r\nwith guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.\r\n\r\n21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\n21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found\r\nin his hand, he shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\n21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,\r\nor with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If he\r\nrise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote\r\nhim be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall\r\ncause him to be thoroughly healed.\r\n\r\n21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he\r\ndie under his hand; he shall be surely punished.\r\n\r\n21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be\r\npunished: for he is his money.\r\n\r\n21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit\r\ndepart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely\r\npunished, according as the woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband will lay upon him; and he\r\nshall pay as the judges determine.\r\n\r\n21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,\r\n21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\r\n21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\r\n\r\n21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his\r\nmaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n21:27 And if he smite out his manservant\xe2\x80\x99s tooth, or his maidservant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall\r\nbe surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of\r\nthe ox shall be quit.\r\n\r\n21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and\r\nit hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but\r\nthat he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his\r\nowner also shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for\r\nthe ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.\r\n\r\n21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according\r\nto this judgment shall it be done unto him.\r\n\r\n21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall\r\ngive unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be\r\nstoned.\r\n\r\n21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and\r\nnot cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 21:34 The owner of the\r\npit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the\r\ndead beast shall be his.\r\n\r\n21:35 And if one man\xe2\x80\x99s ox hurt another\xe2\x80\x99s, that he die; then they shall\r\nsell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also\r\nthey shall divide.\r\n\r\n21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,\r\nand his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and\r\nthe dead shall be his own.\r\n\r\n22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;\r\nhe shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.\r\n\r\n22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,\r\nthere shall no blood be shed for him.\r\n\r\n22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;\r\nfor he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall\r\nbe sold for his theft.\r\n\r\n22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be\r\nox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.\r\n\r\n22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall\r\nput in his beast, and shall feed in another man\xe2\x80\x99s field; of the best\r\nof his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make\r\nrestitution.\r\n\r\n22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of\r\ncorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he\r\nthat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.\r\n\r\n22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,\r\nand it be stolen out of the man\xe2\x80\x99s house; if the thief be found, let\r\nhim pay double.\r\n\r\n22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be\r\nbrought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his\r\nneighbour\xe2\x80\x99s goods.\r\n\r\n22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for\r\nsheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another\r\nchallengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the\r\njudges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto\r\nhis neighbour.\r\n\r\n22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a\r\nsheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,\r\nno man seeing it: 22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them\r\nboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s goods; and\r\nthe owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.\r\n\r\n22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the\r\nowner thereof.\r\n\r\n22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and\r\nhe shall not make good that which was torn.\r\n\r\n22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or\r\ndie, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good:\r\nif it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.\r\n\r\n22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with\r\nher, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.\r\n\r\n22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay\r\nmoney according to the dowry of virgins.\r\n\r\n22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\r\n\r\n22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he\r\nshall be utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were\r\nstrangers in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.\r\n\r\n22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I\r\nwill surely hear their cry; 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I\r\nwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your\r\nchildren fatherless.\r\n\r\n22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,\r\nthou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him\r\nusury.\r\n\r\n22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbours raiment to pledge, thou\r\nshalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For that\r\nis his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he\r\nsleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will\r\nhear; for I am gracious.\r\n\r\n22:28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n22:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and\r\nof thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.\r\n\r\n22:30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:\r\nseven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give\r\nit me.\r\n\r\n22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh\r\nthat is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.\r\n\r\n23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the\r\nwicked to be an unrighteous witness.\r\n\r\n23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou\r\nspeak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neither\r\nshalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.\r\n\r\n23:4 If thou meet thine enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt\r\nsurely bring it back to him again.\r\n\r\n23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his\r\nburden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.\r\n\r\n23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous\r\nslay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.\r\n\r\n23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and\r\nperverteth the words of the righteous.\r\n\r\n23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of\r\na stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the\r\nfruits thereof: 23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and\r\nlie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave\r\nthe beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with\r\nthy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.\r\n\r\n23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou\r\nshalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy\r\nhandmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.\r\n\r\n23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and\r\nmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out\r\nof thy mouth.\r\n\r\n23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.\r\n\r\n23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat\r\nunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time\r\nappointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and\r\nnone shall appear before me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,\r\nthe firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and\r\nthe feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou\r\nhast gathered in thy labours out of the field.\r\n\r\n23:17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the\r\nLORD God.\r\n\r\n23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened\r\nbread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.\r\n\r\n23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into\r\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s milk.\r\n\r\n23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,\r\nand to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.\r\n\r\n23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will\r\nnot pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.\r\n\r\n23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I\r\nspeak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary\r\nunto thine adversaries.\r\n\r\n23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the\r\nAmorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,\r\nthe Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.\r\n\r\n23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do\r\nafter their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite\r\nbreak down their images.\r\n\r\n23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy\r\nbread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy\r\nland: the number of thy days I will fulfil.\r\n\r\n23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people\r\nto whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their\r\nbacks unto thee.\r\n\r\n23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the\r\nHivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.\r\n\r\n23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the\r\nland become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,\r\nuntil thou be increased, and inherit the land.\r\n\r\n23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of\r\nthe Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will\r\ndeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt\r\ndrive them out before thee.\r\n\r\n23:32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.\r\n\r\n23:33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin\r\nagainst me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare\r\nunto thee.\r\n\r\n24:1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron,\r\nNadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye\r\nafar off.\r\n\r\n24:2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come\r\nnigh; neither shall the people go up with him.\r\n\r\n24:3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and\r\nall the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and\r\nsaid, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.\r\n\r\n24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in\r\nthe morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,\r\naccording to the twelve tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered\r\nburnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half\r\nof the blood he sprinkled on the altar.\r\n\r\n24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of\r\nthe people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and\r\nbe obedient.\r\n\r\n24:8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and\r\nsaid, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with\r\nyou concerning all these words.\r\n\r\n24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of\r\nthe elders of Israel: 24:10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there\r\nwas under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as\r\nit were the body of heaven in his clearness.\r\n\r\n24:11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his\r\nhand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.\r\n\r\n24:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and\r\nbe there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and\r\ncommandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.\r\n\r\n24:13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up\r\ninto the mount of God.\r\n\r\n24:14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come\r\nagain unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man\r\nhave any matters to do, let him come unto them.\r\n\r\n24:15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.\r\n\r\n24:16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud\r\ncovered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of\r\nthe midst of the cloud.\r\n\r\n24:17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire\r\non the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n24:18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into\r\nthe mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.\r\n\r\n25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that\r\ngiveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.\r\n\r\n25:3 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and\r\nsilver, and brass, 25:4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine\r\nlinen, and goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair, 25:5 And rams\xe2\x80\x99 skins dyed red, and badgers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nskins, and shittim wood, 25:6 Oil for the light, spices for anointing\r\noil, and for sweet incense, 25:7 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in\r\nthe ephod, and in the breastplate.\r\n\r\n25:8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.\r\n\r\n25:9 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the\r\ntabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so\r\nshall ye make it.\r\n\r\n25:10 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a\r\nhalf shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth\r\nthereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.\r\n\r\n25:11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without\r\nshalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n25:12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in\r\nthe four corners thereof;

a span shall be the length\r\nthereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.\r\n\r\n28:17 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of\r\nstones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle:\r\nthis shall be the first row.\r\n\r\n28:18 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\n28:19 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.\r\n\r\n28:20 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they\r\nshall be set in gold in their inclosings.\r\n\r\n28:21 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of\r\nIsrael, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a\r\nsignet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n28:22 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of\r\nwreathen work of pure gold.\r\n\r\n28:23 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and\r\nshalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.\r\n\r\n28:24 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two\r\nrings which are on the ends of the breastplate.\r\n\r\n28:25 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt\r\nfasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the\r\nephod before it.\r\n\r\n28:26 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them\r\nupon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is\r\nin the side of the ephod inward.\r\n\r\n28:27 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them\r\non the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof,\r\nover against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of\r\nthe ephod.\r\n\r\n28:28 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto\r\nthe rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the\r\ncurious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed\r\nfrom the ephod.\r\n\r\n28:29 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the\r\nbreastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy\r\nplace, for a memorial before the LORD continually.\r\n\r\n28:30 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and\r\nthe Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s heart, when he goeth in\r\nbefore the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of\r\nIsrael upon his heart before the LORD continually.\r\n\r\n28:31 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.\r\n\r\n28:32 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst\r\nthereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of\r\nit, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.\r\n\r\n28:33 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of\r\nblue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and\r\nbells of gold between them round about: 28:34 A golden bell and a\r\npomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe\r\nround about.\r\n\r\n28:35 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be\r\nheard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when\r\nhe cometh out, that he die not.\r\n\r\n28:36 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,\r\nlike the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\r\n\r\n28:37 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the\r\nmitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.\r\n\r\n28:38 And it shall be upon Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, that Aaron may bear the\r\niniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow\r\nin all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead,\r\nthat they may be accepted before the LORD.\r\n\r\n28:39 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt\r\nmake the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of\r\nneedlework.\r\n\r\n28:40 And for Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make\r\nfor them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and\r\nfor beauty.\r\n\r\n28:41 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons\r\nwith him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify\r\nthem, that they may minister unto me in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n28:42 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their\r\nnakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach: 28:43\r\nAnd they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in\r\nunto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto\r\nthe altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity,\r\nand die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n29:1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow\r\nthem, to minister unto me in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office: Take one young\r\nbullock, and two rams without blemish, 29:2 And unleavened bread, and\r\ncakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed\r\nwith oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.\r\n\r\n29:3 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the\r\nbasket, with the bullock and the two rams.\r\n\r\n29:4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.\r\n\r\n29:5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,\r\nand the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and\r\ngird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 29:6 And thou shalt put\r\nthe mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.\r\n\r\n29:7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his\r\nhead, and anoint him.\r\n\r\n29:8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.\r\n\r\n29:9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and\r\nput the bonnets on them: and the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office shall be theirs for a\r\nperpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.\r\n\r\n29:10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their\r\nhands upon the head of the bullock.\r\n\r\n29:11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n29:12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon\r\nthe horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside\r\nthe bottom of the altar.\r\n\r\n29:13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and\r\nthe caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat\r\nthat is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.\r\n\r\n29:14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt\r\nthou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.\r\n\r\n29:15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put\r\ntheir hands upon the head of the ram.\r\n\r\n29:16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and\r\nsprinkle it round about upon the altar.\r\n\r\n29:17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of\r\nhim, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.\r\n\r\n29:18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt\r\noffering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire\r\nunto the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall\r\nput their hands upon the head of the ram.\r\n\r\n29:20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it\r\nupon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right\r\near of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the\r\ngreat toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar\r\nround about.\r\n\r\n29:21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of\r\nthe anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,\r\nand upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he\r\nshall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngarments with him.\r\n\r\n29:22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the\r\nfat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the\r\ntwo kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder;\r\nfor it is a ram of consecration: 29:23 And one loaf of bread, and one\r\ncake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened\r\nbread that is before the LORD: 29:24 And thou shalt put all in the\r\nhands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for\r\na wave offering before the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon\r\nthe altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it\r\nis an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it\r\nshall be thy part.\r\n\r\n29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the\r\nshoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved\r\nup, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,\r\nand of that which is for his sons: 29:28 And it shall be Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nhis sons\xe2\x80\x99 by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is\r\nan heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children\r\nof Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave\r\noffering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons\xe2\x80\x99 after him, to\r\nbe anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.\r\n\r\n29:30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven\r\ndays, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to\r\nminister in the holy place.\r\n\r\n29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his\r\nflesh in the holy place.\r\n\r\n29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the\r\nbread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was\r\nmade, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat\r\nthereof, because they are holy.\r\n\r\n29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,\r\nremain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:\r\nit shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\r\n\r\n29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to\r\nall things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou\r\nconsecrate them.\r\n\r\n29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for\r\natonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an\r\natonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.\r\n\r\n29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and\r\nsanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth\r\nthe altar shall be holy.\r\n\r\n29:38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two\r\nlambs of the first year day by day continually.\r\n\r\n29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb\r\nthou shalt offer at even: 29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of\r\nflour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the\r\nfourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.\r\n\r\n29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do\r\nthereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according\r\nto the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by\r\nfire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your\r\ngenerations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before\r\nthe LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.\r\n\r\n29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the\r\ntabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.\r\n\r\n29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the\r\naltar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me\r\nin the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n29:46 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought\r\nthem forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am\r\nthe LORD their God.\r\n\r\n30:1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim\r\nwood shalt thou make it.\r\n\r\n30:2 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth\r\nthereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height\r\nthereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.\r\n\r\n30:3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and\r\nthe sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt\r\nmake unto it a crown of gold round about.\r\n\r\n30:4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,\r\nby the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make\r\nit; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.\r\n\r\n30:5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\n30:6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the\r\ntestimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I\r\nwill meet with thee.\r\n\r\n30:7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he\r\ndresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.\r\n\r\n30:8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense\r\nupon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n30:9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,\r\nnor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.\r\n\r\n30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a\r\nyear with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the\r\nyear shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it\r\nis most holy unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest\r\nthe sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they\r\ngive every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou\r\nnumberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou\r\nnumberest them.\r\n\r\n30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are\r\nnumbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel\r\nis twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty\r\nyears old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less\r\nthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make\r\nan atonement for your souls.\r\n\r\n30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of\r\nIsrael, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel\r\nbefore the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.\r\n\r\n30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also\r\nmake a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and\r\nthou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the\r\naltar, and thou shalt put water therein.\r\n\r\n30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet\r\nthereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,\r\nthey shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near\r\nto the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:\r\n30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die\r\nnot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to\r\nhis seed throughout their generations.\r\n\r\n30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also\r\nunto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of\r\nsweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and\r\nof sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia\r\nfive hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil\r\nolive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an\r\nointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy\r\nanointing oil.\r\n\r\n30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation\r\ntherewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and all\r\nhis vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of\r\nincense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,\r\nand the laver and his foot.\r\n\r\n30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:\r\nwhatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.\r\n\r\n30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,\r\nthat they may minister unto me in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This\r\nshall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.\r\n\r\n30:32 Upon man\xe2\x80\x99s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make\r\nany other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it\r\nshall be holy unto you.\r\n\r\n30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of\r\nit upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,\r\nstacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure\r\nfrankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thou\r\nshalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,\r\ntempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of it\r\nvery small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you\r\nmost holy.\r\n\r\n30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make\r\nto yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto\r\nthee holy for the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall\r\neven be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by\r\nname Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:\r\n31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in\r\nunderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,\r\n31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in\r\nbrass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of\r\ntimber, to work in all manner of workmanship.\r\n\r\n31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of\r\nAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise\r\nhearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have\r\ncommanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark\r\nof the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the\r\nfurniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, and\r\nthe pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,\r\n31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the\r\nlaver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holy\r\ngarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to\r\nminister in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, and\r\nsweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have\r\ncommanded thee shall they do.\r\n\r\n31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also\r\nunto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:\r\nfor it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that\r\nye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.\r\n\r\n31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:\r\nevery one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever\r\ndoeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of\r\nrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,\r\nhe shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to\r\nobserve the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\r\ncovenant.\r\n\r\n31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for\r\nin six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he\r\nrested, and was refreshed.\r\n\r\n31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing\r\nwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,\r\nwritten with the finger of God.\r\n\r\n32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of\r\nthe mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and\r\nsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for\r\nthis Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we\r\nwot not what is become of him.\r\n\r\n32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which\r\nare in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,\r\nand bring them unto me.\r\n\r\n32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in\r\ntheir ears, and brought them unto Aaron.\r\n\r\n32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a\r\ngraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These\r\nbe thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron\r\nmade proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.\r\n\r\n32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt\r\nofferings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat\r\nand to drink, and rose up to play.\r\n\r\n32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,\r\nwhich thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted\r\nthemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I\r\ncommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped\r\nit, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O\r\nIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,\r\nbehold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,\r\nthat my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:\r\nand I will make of thee a great nation.\r\n\r\n32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth\r\nthy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth\r\nout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?\r\n32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did\r\nhe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them\r\nfrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of\r\nthis evil against thy people.\r\n\r\n32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou\r\nswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your\r\nseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of\r\nwill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.\r\n\r\n32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\n32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two\r\ntables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on\r\nboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\r\n\r\n32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the\r\nwriting of God, graven upon the tables.\r\n\r\n32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,\r\nhe said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.\r\n\r\n32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,\r\nneither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the\r\nnoise of them that sing do I hear.\r\n\r\n32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that\r\nhe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses\xe2\x80\x99 anger waxed hot, and he\r\ncast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.\r\n\r\n32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the\r\nfire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made\r\nthe children of Israel drink of it.\r\n\r\n32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that\r\nthou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Let\r\nnot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they\r\nare set on mischief.\r\n\r\n32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:\r\nfor as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of\r\nEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.\r\n\r\n32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it\r\noff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came\r\nout this calf.\r\n\r\n32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had\r\nmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 Then\r\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered\r\nthemselves together unto him.\r\n\r\n32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put\r\nevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate\r\nthroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his\r\ncompanion, and every man his neighbour.\r\n\r\n32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and\r\nthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\r\n\r\n32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,\r\neven every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow\r\nupon you a blessing this day.\r\n\r\n32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the\r\npeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the\r\nLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.\r\n\r\n32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have\r\nsinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.\r\n\r\n32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,\r\nI pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.\r\n\r\n32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,\r\nhim will I blot out of my book.\r\n\r\n32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have\r\nspoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:\r\nnevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.\r\n\r\n32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,\r\nwhich Aaron made.\r\n\r\n33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and\r\nthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto\r\nthe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,\r\nUnto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel before\r\nthee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the\r\nHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto a\r\nland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of\r\nthee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and\r\nno man did put on him his ornaments.\r\n\r\n33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of\r\nIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of\r\nthee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy\r\nornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.\r\n\r\n33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments\r\nby the mount Horeb.\r\n\r\n33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,\r\nafar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the\r\nLORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was\r\nwithout the camp.\r\n\r\n33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,\r\nthat all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and\r\nlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the\r\ncloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and\r\nthe Lord talked with Moses.\r\n\r\n33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle\r\ndoor: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh\r\nunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant\r\nJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the\r\ntabernacle.\r\n\r\n33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up\r\nthis people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with\r\nme. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found\r\ngrace in my sight.\r\n\r\n33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,\r\nshew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in\r\nthy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.\r\n\r\n33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give\r\nthee rest.\r\n\r\n33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us\r\nnot up hence.\r\n\r\n33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have\r\nfound grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so\r\nshall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are\r\nupon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that\r\nthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know\r\nthee by name.\r\n\r\n33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\r\n\r\n33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I\r\nwill proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious\r\nto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man\r\nsee me, and live.\r\n\r\n33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou\r\nshalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while my\r\nglory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and\r\nwill cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will take\r\naway mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall\r\nnot be seen.\r\n\r\n34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like\r\nunto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were\r\nin the first tables, which thou brakest.\r\n\r\n34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto\r\nmount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.\r\n\r\n34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen\r\nthroughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before\r\nthat mount.\r\n\r\n34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses\r\nrose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the\r\nLORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\r\n\r\n34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,\r\nand proclaimed the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The\r\nLORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in\r\ngoodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving\r\niniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear\r\nthe guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,\r\nand upon the children\xe2\x80\x99s children, unto the third and to the fourth\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and\r\nworshipped.\r\n\r\n34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let\r\nmy LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and\r\npardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.\r\n\r\n34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I\r\nwill do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in\r\nany nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work\r\nof the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.\r\n\r\n34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive\r\nout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and\r\nthe Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\r\n\r\n34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the\r\ninhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in\r\nthe midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break\r\ntheir images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worship\r\nno other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\r\n34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and\r\nthey go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,\r\nand one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou take\r\nof their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring\r\nafter their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.\r\n\r\n34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\r\n\r\n34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou\r\nshalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the\r\nmonth Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.\r\n\r\n34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among\r\nthy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.\r\n\r\n34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and\r\nif thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the\r\nfirstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before\r\nme empty.\r\n\r\n34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt\r\nrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\r\n\r\n34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of\r\nwheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\n\r\n34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the\r\nLORD God, the God of Israel.\r\n\r\n34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy\r\nborders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up\r\nto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.\r\n\r\n34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;\r\nneither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto\r\nthe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s milk.\r\n\r\n34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after\r\nthe tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he\r\ndid neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables\r\nthe words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\r\n\r\n34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with\r\nthe two tables of testimony in Moses\xe2\x80\x99 hand, when he came down from the\r\nmount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he\r\ntalked with him.\r\n\r\n34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,\r\nthe skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.\r\n\r\n34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the\r\ncongregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.\r\n\r\n34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave\r\nthem in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount\r\nSinai.\r\n\r\n34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he\r\ntook the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto\r\nthe children of Israel that which he was commanded.\r\n\r\n34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin\r\nof Moses\xe2\x80\x99 face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again,\r\nuntil he went in to speak with him.\r\n\r\n35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel\r\ntogether, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath\r\ncommanded, that ye should do them.\r\n\r\n35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall\r\nbe to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth\r\nwork therein shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the\r\nsabbath day.\r\n\r\n35:4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of\r\nIsrael, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,\r\n35:5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of\r\na willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and\r\nsilver, and brass, 35:6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine\r\nlinen, and goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair, 35:7 And rams\xe2\x80\x99 skins dyed red, and badgers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nskins, and shittim wood, 35:8 And oil for the light, and spices for\r\nanointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 35:9 And onyx stones, and\r\nstones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.\r\n\r\n35:10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that\r\nthe LORD hath commanded; 35:11 The tabernacle, his tent, and his\r\ncovering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his\r\nsockets, 35:12 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat,\r\nand the vail of the covering, 35:13 The table, and his staves, and all\r\nhis vessels, and the shewbread, 35:14 The candlestick also for the\r\nlight, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,\r\n35:15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,\r\nand the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in\r\nof the tabernacle, 35:16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen\r\ngrate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 35:17\r\nThe hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the\r\nhanging for the door of the court, 35:18 The pins of the tabernacle,\r\nand the pins of the court, and their cords, 35:19 The cloths of\r\nservice, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron\r\nthe priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n35:20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from\r\nthe presence of Moses.\r\n\r\n35:21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every\r\none whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s offering\r\nto the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his\r\nservice, and for the holy garments.\r\n\r\n35:22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing\r\nhearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,\r\nall jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of\r\ngold unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and\r\nscarlet, and fine linen, and goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair, and red skins of rams, and\r\nbadgers\xe2\x80\x99 skins, brought them.\r\n\r\n35:24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought\r\nthe LORD\xe2\x80\x99s offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood\r\nfor any work of the service, brought it.\r\n\r\n35:25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their\r\nhands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of\r\npurple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.\r\n\r\n35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun\r\ngoats\xe2\x80\x99 hair.\r\n\r\n35:27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for\r\nthe ephod, and for the breastplate; 35:28 And spice, and oil for the\r\nlight, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.\r\n\r\n35:29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD,\r\nevery man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all\r\nmanner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of\r\nMoses.\r\n\r\n35:30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath\r\ncalled by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe\r\nof Judah; 35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in\r\nwisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of\r\nworkmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and\r\nin silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to set\r\nthem, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.\r\n\r\n35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and\r\nAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\r\n\r\n35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of\r\nwork, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the\r\nembroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,\r\nand of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that\r\ndevise cunning work.\r\n\r\n36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in\r\nwhom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all\r\nmanner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that\r\nthe LORD had commanded.\r\n\r\n36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted\r\nman, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose\r\nheart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And they\r\nreceived of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had\r\nbrought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it\r\nwithal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.\r\n\r\n36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,\r\ncame every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake unto\r\nMoses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service\r\nof the work, which the LORD commanded to make.\r\n\r\n36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed\r\nthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more\r\nwork for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained\r\nfrom bringing.\r\n\r\n36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make\r\nit, and too much.\r\n\r\n36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of\r\nthe tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and\r\npurple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.\r\n\r\n36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the\r\nbreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.\r\n\r\n36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other\r\nfive curtains he coupled one unto another.\r\n\r\n36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the\r\nselvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of\r\nanother curtain, in the coupling of the second.\r\n\r\n36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in\r\nthe edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the\r\nloops held one curtain to another.\r\n\r\n36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one\r\nunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.\r\n\r\n36:14 And he made curtains of goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair for the tent over the\r\ntabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.\r\n\r\n36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was\r\nthe breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.\r\n\r\n36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain\r\nin the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain\r\nwhich coupleth the second.\r\n\r\n36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,\r\nthat it might be one.\r\n\r\n36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams\xe2\x80\x99 skins dyed red, and\r\na covering of badgers\xe2\x80\x99 skins above that.\r\n\r\n36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing\r\nup.\r\n\r\n36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board\r\none cubit and a half.\r\n\r\n36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus\r\ndid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the\r\nsouth side southward: 36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under\r\nthe twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and\r\ntwo sockets under another board for his two tenons.\r\n\r\n36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the\r\nnorth corner, he made twenty boards, 36:26 And their forty sockets of\r\nsilver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.\r\n\r\n36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the\r\ntwo sides.\r\n\r\n36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head\r\nthereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.\r\n\r\n36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen\r\nsockets of silver, under every board two sockets.\r\n\r\n36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one\r\nside of the tabernacle, 36:32 And five bars for the boards of the\r\nother side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the\r\ntabernacle for the sides westward.\r\n\r\n36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the\r\none end to the other.\r\n\r\n36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of\r\ngold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.\r\n\r\n36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine\r\ntwined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.\r\n\r\n36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid\r\nthem with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four\r\nsockets of silver.\r\n\r\n36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and\r\npurple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 36:38 And\r\nthe five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their\r\nchapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n37:1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half\r\nwas the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a\r\ncubit and a half the height of it: 37:2 And he overlaid it with pure\r\ngold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.\r\n\r\n37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four\r\ncorners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings\r\nupon the other side of it.\r\n\r\n37:4 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.\r\n\r\n37:5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to\r\nbear the ark.\r\n\r\n37:6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half\r\nwas the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.\r\n\r\n37:7 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made\r\nhe them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 37:8 One cherub on the end\r\non this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of\r\nthe mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.\r\n\r\n37:9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered\r\nwith their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;\r\neven to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.\r\n\r\n37:10 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length\r\nthereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the\r\nheight thereof: 37:11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made\r\nthereunto a crown of gold round about.\r\n\r\n37:12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;\r\nand made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.\r\n\r\n37:13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon\r\nthe four corners that were in the four feet thereof.\r\n\r\n37:14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the\r\nstaves to bear the table.\r\n\r\n37:15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with\r\ngold, to bear the table.\r\n\r\n37:16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,\r\nand his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n37:17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he\r\nthe candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and\r\nhis flowers, were of the same: 37:18 And six branches going out of the\r\nsides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side\r\nthereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side\r\nthereof: 37:19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one\r\nbranch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in\r\nanother branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches\r\ngoing out of the candlestick.\r\n\r\n37:20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his\r\nknops, and his flowers: 37:21 And a knop under two branches of the\r\nsame, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two\r\nbranches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.\r\n\r\n37:22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was\r\none beaten work of pure gold.\r\n\r\n37:23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his\r\nsnuffdishes, of pure gold.\r\n\r\n37:24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n37:25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it\r\nwas a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two\r\ncubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.\r\n\r\n37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the\r\nsides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a\r\ncrown of gold round about.\r\n\r\n37:27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by\r\nthe two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for\r\nthe staves to bear it withal.\r\n\r\n37:28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of\r\nsweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.\r\n\r\n38:1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five\r\ncubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it\r\nwas foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.\r\n\r\n38:2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the\r\nhorns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.\r\n\r\n38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the\r\nshovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the\r\nvessels thereof made he of brass.\r\n\r\n38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the\r\ncompass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.\r\n\r\n38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,\r\nto be places for the staves.\r\n\r\n38:6 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n38:7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,\r\nto bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.\r\n\r\n38:8 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of\r\nthe lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the\r\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n38:9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings\r\nof the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: 38:10 Their\r\npillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the\r\npillars and their fillets were of silver.\r\n\r\n38:11 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,\r\ntheir pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the\r\nhooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.\r\n\r\n38:12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their\r\npillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their\r\nfillets of silver.\r\n\r\n38:13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.\r\n\r\n38:14 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;\r\ntheir pillars three, and their sockets three.\r\n\r\n38:15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that\r\nhand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their\r\nsockets three.\r\n\r\n38:16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined\r\nlinen.\r\n\r\n38:17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the\r\npillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their\r\nchapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted\r\nwith silver.\r\n\r\n38:18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of\r\nblue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty\r\ncubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits,\r\nanswerable to the hangings of the court.\r\n\r\n38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;\r\ntheir hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their\r\nfillets of silver.\r\n\r\n38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round\r\nabout, were of brass.\r\n\r\n38:21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of\r\ntestimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,\r\nfor the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron\r\nthe priest.\r\n\r\n38:22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of\r\nJudah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n38:23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,\r\nan engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in\r\npurple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.\r\n\r\n38:24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of\r\nthe holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine\r\ntalents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n38:25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation\r\nwas an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore\r\nand fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 38:26 A bekah\r\nfor every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the\r\nsanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years\r\nold and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five\r\nhundred and fifty men.\r\n\r\n38:27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of\r\nthe sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the\r\nhundred talents, a talent for a socket.\r\n\r\n38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he\r\nmade hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n38:29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two\r\nthousand and four hundred shekels.\r\n\r\n38:30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle\r\nof the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for\r\nit, and all the vessels of the altar, 38:31 And the sockets of the\r\ncourt round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins\r\nof the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.\r\n\r\n39:1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of\r\nservice, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments\r\nfor Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and\r\nfine twined linen.\r\n\r\n39:3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into\r\nwires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet,\r\nand in the fine linen, with cunning work.\r\n\r\n39:4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the\r\ntwo edges was it coupled together.\r\n\r\n39:5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the\r\nsame, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and\r\nscarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven,\r\nas signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n39:7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should\r\nbe stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the\r\nephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.\r\n\r\n39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was\r\nthe length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.\r\n\r\n39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a\r\nsardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.\r\n\r\n39:11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.\r\n\r\n39:12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.\r\n\r\n39:13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were\r\ninclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.\r\n\r\n39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of\r\nIsrael, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a\r\nsignet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.\r\n\r\n39:15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of\r\nwreathen work of pure gold.\r\n\r\n39:16 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put\r\nthe two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.\r\n\r\n39:17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on\r\nthe ends of the breastplate.\r\n\r\n39:18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the\r\ntwo ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before\r\nit.\r\n\r\n39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of\r\nthe breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the\r\nephod inward.\r\n\r\n39:20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two\r\nsides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against\r\nthe other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.\r\n\r\n39:21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of\r\nthe ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious\r\ngirdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from\r\nthe ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.\r\n\r\n39:23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of\r\nan habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not\r\nrend.\r\n\r\n39:24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,\r\nand purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.\r\n\r\n39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the\r\npomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the\r\npomegranates; 39:26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a\r\npomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the\r\nLORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and\r\nfor his sons, 39:28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of\r\nfine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 39:29 And a\r\ngirdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of\r\nneedlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and\r\nwrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS\r\nTO THE LORD.\r\n\r\n39:31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon\r\nthe mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n39:32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the\r\ncongregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all\r\nthat the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.\r\n\r\n39:33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all\r\nhis furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and\r\nhis sockets, 39:34 And the covering of rams\xe2\x80\x99 skins dyed red, and the\r\ncovering of badgers\xe2\x80\x99 skins, and the vail of the covering, 39:35 The\r\nark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,\r\n39:36 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 39:37\r\nThe pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to\r\nbe set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,\r\n39:38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet\r\nincense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 39:39 The brasen\r\naltar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the\r\nlaver and his foot, 39:40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and\r\nhis sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his\r\npins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the\r\ntent of the congregation, 39:41 The cloths of service to do service in\r\nthe holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his\r\nsons\xe2\x80\x99 garments, to minister in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n39:42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children\r\nof Israel made all the work.\r\n\r\n39:43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done\r\nit as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses\r\nblessed them.\r\n\r\n40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 40:2 On the first day of\r\nthe first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover\r\nthe ark with the vail.\r\n\r\n40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things\r\nthat are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the\r\ncandlestick, and light the lamps thereof.\r\n\r\n40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the\r\nark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the\r\ntabernacle.\r\n\r\n40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the\r\ndoor of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.\r\n\r\n40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation\r\nand the altar, and shalt put water therein.\r\n\r\n40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the\r\nhanging at the court gate.\r\n\r\n40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,\r\nand all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels\r\nthereof: and it shall be holy.\r\n\r\n40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all\r\nhis vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most\r\nholy.\r\n\r\n40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.\r\n\r\n40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.\r\n\r\n40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,\r\nand sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15\r\nAnd thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that\r\nthey may minister unto me in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office: for their anointing\r\nshall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so\r\ndid he.\r\n\r\n40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on\r\nthe first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.\r\n\r\n40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,\r\nand set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared\r\nup his pillars.\r\n\r\n40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the\r\ncovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the\r\nstaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21\r\nAnd he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the\r\ncovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded\r\nMoses.\r\n\r\n40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the\r\nside of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.\r\n\r\n40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the\r\nLORD had commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over\r\nagainst the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.\r\n\r\n40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded\r\nMoses.\r\n\r\n40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation\r\nbefore the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses.\r\n\r\n40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the\r\nburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and\r\nthe altar, and put water there, to wash withal.\r\n\r\n40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their\r\nfeet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,\r\nand when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses.\r\n\r\n40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the\r\naltar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory\r\nof the LORD filled the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the\r\ncongregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the\r\nLORD filled the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the\r\nchildren of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if the\r\ncloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it\r\nwas taken up.\r\n\r\n40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and\r\nfire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,\r\nthroughout all their journeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children of\r\nIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto\r\nthe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the\r\nherd, and of the flock.\r\n\r\n1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a\r\nmale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at\r\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and\r\nit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.\r\n\r\n1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,\r\nAaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round\r\nabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.\r\n\r\n1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,\r\nand lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the\r\nwood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwards\r\nand his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on\r\nthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\r\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of\r\nthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without\r\nblemish.\r\n\r\n1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before\r\nthe LORD: and the priests, Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons, shall sprinkle his blood\r\nround about upon the altar.\r\n\r\n1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:\r\nand the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire\r\nwhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the\r\nlegs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon\r\nthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a\r\nsweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of\r\nfowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young\r\npigeons.\r\n\r\n1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his\r\nhead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung\r\nout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his crop\r\nwith his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by\r\nthe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wings\r\nthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it\r\nupon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt\r\nsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his\r\noffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and\r\nput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons\r\nthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour\r\nthereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;\r\nand the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an\r\noffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And the\r\nremnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s and his sons\xe2\x80\x99: it is a\r\nthing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.\r\n\r\n2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the\r\noven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or\r\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil.\r\n\r\n2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be\r\nof fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.\r\n\r\n2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat\r\noffering.\r\n\r\n2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it\r\nshall be made of fine flour with oil.\r\n\r\n2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these\r\nthings unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he\r\nshall bring it unto the altar.\r\n\r\n2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial\r\nthereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by\r\nfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nhis sons\xe2\x80\x99: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made\r\nby fire.\r\n\r\n2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be\r\nmade with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any\r\noffering of the LORD made by fire.\r\n\r\n2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto\r\nthe LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.\r\n\r\n2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with\r\nsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to\r\nbe lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt\r\noffer salt.\r\n\r\n2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the\r\nLORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green\r\nears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.\r\n\r\n2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it\r\nis a meat offering.\r\n\r\n2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten\r\ncorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense\r\nthereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer\r\nit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it\r\nwithout blemish before the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill\r\nit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons\r\nthe priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.\r\n\r\n3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an\r\noffering made by fire unto the LORD;

male or female, he shall offer it without\r\nblemish.\r\n\r\n3:7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n3:8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill\r\nit before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons shall\r\nsprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.\r\n\r\n3:9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an\r\noffering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole\r\nrump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that\r\ncovereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:10\r\nAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the\r\nflanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he\r\ntake away.\r\n\r\n3:11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of\r\nthe offering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:12 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n3:13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall\r\nsprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.\r\n\r\n3:14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by\r\nfire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat\r\nthat is upon the inwards, 3:15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that\r\nis upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,\r\nwith the kidneys, it shall he take away.\r\n\r\n3:16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of\r\nthe offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n3:17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout\r\nall your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.\r\n\r\n4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the children\r\nof Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any\r\nof the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to\r\nbe done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 If the priest that is\r\nanointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring\r\nfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish\r\nunto the LORD for a sin offering.\r\n\r\n4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the\r\nbullock\xe2\x80\x99s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock\xe2\x80\x99s blood,\r\nand bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priest\r\nshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven\r\ntimes before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the\r\naltar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the\r\nbottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n4:8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the\r\nsin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that\r\nis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon\r\nthem, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the\r\nkidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from the\r\nbullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn\r\nthem upon the altar of the burnt offering.\r\n\r\n4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,\r\nand with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the whole\r\nbullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,\r\nwhere the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:\r\nwhere the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.\r\n\r\n4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,\r\nand the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done\r\nsomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things\r\nwhich should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, which\r\nthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall\r\noffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle\r\nof the congregation.\r\n\r\n4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the\r\nhead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed\r\nbefore the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shall\r\ndip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times\r\nbefore the LORD, even before the vail.\r\n\r\n4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar\r\nwhich is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the\r\naltar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation.\r\n\r\n4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\n4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a\r\nsin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an\r\natonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.\r\n\r\n4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn\r\nhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance\r\nagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things\r\nwhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, wherein\r\nhe hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a\r\nkid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay his\r\nhand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they\r\nkill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.\r\n\r\n4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with\r\nhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,\r\nand shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt\r\noffering.\r\n\r\n4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the\r\nsacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement\r\nfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n4:27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while\r\nhe doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD\r\nconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 4:28 Or\r\nif his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall\r\nbring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for\r\nhis sin which he hath sinned.\r\n\r\n4:29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and\r\nslay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.\r\n\r\n4:30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,\r\nand put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall\r\npour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.\r\n\r\n4:31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken\r\naway from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall\r\nburn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the\r\npriest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n4:32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a\r\nfemale without blemish.\r\n\r\n4:33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and\r\nslay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt\r\noffering.\r\n\r\n4:34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with\r\nhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,\r\nand shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:\r\n4:35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the\r\nlamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the\r\npriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made\r\nby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his\r\nsin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a\r\nwitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,\r\nthen he shall bear his iniquity.\r\n\r\n5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of\r\nan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of\r\nunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall\r\nbe unclean, and guilty.\r\n\r\n5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it\r\nbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he\r\nknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.\r\n\r\n5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do\r\ngood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it\r\nbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one\r\nof these.\r\n\r\n5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,\r\nthat he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And he\r\nshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he\r\nhath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,\r\nfor a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him\r\nconcerning his sin.\r\n\r\n5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his\r\ntrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young\r\npigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a\r\nburnt offering.\r\n\r\n5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that\r\nwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his\r\nneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle of\r\nthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest\r\nof the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a\r\nsin offering.\r\n\r\n5:10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to\r\nthe manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin\r\nwhich he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n5:11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young\r\npigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth\r\npart of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil\r\nupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a\r\nsin offering.\r\n\r\n5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take\r\nhis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,\r\naccording to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin\r\noffering.\r\n\r\n5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his\r\nsin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:\r\nand the remnant shall be the priest\xe2\x80\x99s, as a meat offering.\r\n\r\n5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit a\r\ntrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;\r\nthen he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without\r\nblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,\r\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.\r\n\r\n5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the\r\nholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the\r\npriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of\r\nthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are\r\nforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist\r\nit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.\r\n\r\n5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with\r\nthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the\r\npriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance\r\nwherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and\r\ncommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that\r\nwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken\r\naway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have found\r\nthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in\r\nany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall\r\nbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that\r\nwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully\r\ngotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing\r\nwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he\r\nshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part\r\nmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day\r\nof his trespass offering.\r\n\r\n6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram\r\nwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass\r\noffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement\r\nfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of\r\nall that he hath done in trespassing therein.\r\n\r\n6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his\r\nsons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt\r\noffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the\r\nmorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.\r\n\r\n6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen\r\nbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the\r\nfire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall\r\nput them beside the altar.\r\n\r\n6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and\r\ncarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.\r\n\r\n6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not\r\nbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and\r\nlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the\r\nfat of the peace offerings.\r\n\r\n6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go\r\nout.\r\n\r\n6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall\r\noffer it before the LORD, before the altar.\r\n\r\n6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat\r\noffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is\r\nupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet\r\nsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with\r\nunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.\r\n\r\n6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for\r\ntheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the\r\nsin offering, and as the trespass offering.\r\n\r\n6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It\r\nshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the\r\nofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall\r\nbe holy.\r\n\r\n6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering\r\nof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the\r\nday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for\r\na meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof\r\nat night.\r\n\r\n6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou\r\nshalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt\r\nthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall\r\noffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\n6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it\r\nshall not be eaten.\r\n\r\n6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and\r\nto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place\r\nwhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed\r\nbefore the LORD: it is most holy.\r\n\r\n6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy\r\nplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when\r\nthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt\r\nwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.\r\n\r\n6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and\r\nif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed\r\nin water.\r\n\r\n6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most\r\nholy.\r\n\r\n6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,\r\nshall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.\r\n\r\n7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most\r\nholy.\r\n\r\n7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill\r\nthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round\r\nabout upon the altar.\r\n\r\n7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the\r\nfat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat\r\nthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above\r\nthe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest\r\nshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the\r\nLORD: it is a trespass offering.\r\n\r\n7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten\r\nin the holy place: it is most holy.\r\n\r\n7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one\r\nlaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have\r\nit.\r\n\r\n7:8 And the priest that offereth any man\xe2\x80\x99s burnt offering, even the\r\npriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he\r\nhath offered.\r\n\r\n7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that\r\nis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat offereth it.\r\n\r\n7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the\r\nsons of Aaron have, one as much as another.\r\n\r\n7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he\r\nshall offer unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the\r\nsacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and\r\nunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of\r\nfine flour, fried.\r\n\r\n7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread\r\nwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.\r\n\r\n7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an\r\nheave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.\r\n\r\n7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for\r\nthanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall\r\nnot leave any of it until the morning.\r\n\r\n7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary\r\noffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his\r\nsacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:\r\n7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day\r\nshall be burnt with fire.\r\n\r\n7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings\r\nbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither\r\nshall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an\r\nabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.\r\n\r\n7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;\r\nit shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean\r\nshall eat thereof.\r\n\r\n7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace\r\nofferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon\r\nhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the\r\nuncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean\r\nthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which\r\npertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or\r\nof sheep, or of goat.\r\n\r\n7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of\r\nthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye\r\nshall in no wise eat of it.\r\n\r\n7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an\r\noffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it\r\nshall be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl\r\nor of beast, in any of your dwellings.\r\n\r\n7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that\r\nsoul shall be cut off from his people.\r\n\r\n7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his\r\npeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD\r\nof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.\r\n\r\n7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\r\nthe fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be\r\nwaved for a wave offering before the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast\r\nshall be Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s and his sons\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave\r\noffering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.\r\n\r\n7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace\r\nofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.\r\n\r\n7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the\r\nchildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,\r\nand have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a\r\nstatute for ever from among the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the\r\nanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,\r\nin the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the\r\nchildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for\r\never throughout their generations.\r\n\r\n7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and\r\nof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the\r\nconsecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Which\r\nthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded\r\nthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the\r\nwilderness of Sinai.\r\n\r\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons\r\nwith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for\r\nthe sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3\r\nAnd gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was\r\ngathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the\r\nLORD commanded to be done.\r\n\r\n8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.\r\n\r\n8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and\r\nclothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded\r\nhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the\r\nbreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.\r\n\r\n8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon\r\nhis forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the\r\nLORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and\r\nall that was therein, and sanctified them.\r\n\r\n8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed\r\nthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to\r\nsanctify them.\r\n\r\n8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\nanointed him, to sanctify him.\r\n\r\n8:13 And Moses brought Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and put coats upon them, and\r\ngirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses.\r\n\r\n8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and\r\nhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin\r\noffering.\r\n\r\n8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the\r\nhorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the\r\naltar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified\r\nit, to make reconciliation upon it.\r\n\r\n8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul\r\nabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned\r\nit upon the altar.\r\n\r\n8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt\r\nwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his\r\nsons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\r\n\r\n8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar\r\nround about.\r\n\r\n8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the\r\npieces, and the fat.\r\n\r\n8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt\r\nthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet\r\nsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses.\r\n\r\n8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron\r\nand his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.\r\n\r\n8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it\r\nupon the tip of Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right\r\nhand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.\r\n\r\n8:24 And he brought Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the\r\ntip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and\r\nupon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood\r\nupon the altar round about.\r\n\r\n8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon\r\nthe inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and\r\ntheir fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket of\r\nunleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened\r\ncake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the\r\nfat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, and upon his sons\xe2\x80\x99 hands, and waved them for a wave offering\r\nbefore the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the\r\naltar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet\r\nsavour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering\r\nbefore the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses\xe2\x80\x99 part; as\r\nthe LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was\r\nupon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,\r\nand upon his sons, and upon his sons\xe2\x80\x99 garments with him; and\r\nsanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngarments with him.\r\n\r\n8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the\r\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the\r\nbread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,\r\nAaron and his sons shall eat it.\r\n\r\n8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye\r\nburn with fire.\r\n\r\n8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at\r\nan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.\r\n\r\n8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to\r\nmake an atonement for you.\r\n\r\n8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the\r\nLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.\r\n\r\n8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by\r\nthe hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and\r\nhis sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take\r\nthee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,\r\nwithout blemish, and offer them before the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye\r\na kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of\r\nthe first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also a\r\nbullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;\r\nand a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear\r\nunto you.\r\n\r\n9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle\r\nof the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood\r\nbefore the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye\r\nshould do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.\r\n\r\n9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin\r\noffering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,\r\nand for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an\r\natonement for them; as the LORD commanded.\r\n\r\n9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin\r\noffering, which was for himself.\r\n\r\n9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped\r\nhis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and\r\npoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and\r\nthe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he\r\nburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.\r\n\r\n9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons presented unto\r\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.\r\n\r\n9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces\r\nthereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.\r\n\r\n9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the\r\nburnt offering on the altar.\r\n\r\n9:15 And he brought the people\xe2\x80\x99s offering, and took the goat, which\r\nwas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for\r\nsin, as the first.\r\n\r\n9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to\r\nthe manner.\r\n\r\n9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,\r\nand burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace\r\nofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s sons presented unto\r\nhim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And\r\nthe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which\r\ncovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:\r\n9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon\r\nthe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for\r\na wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.\r\n\r\n9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,\r\nand came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt\r\noffering, and peace offerings.\r\n\r\n9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,\r\nand came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD\r\nappeared unto all the people.\r\n\r\n9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon\r\nthe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people\r\nsaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\r\n\r\n10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his\r\ncenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered\r\nstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.\r\n\r\n10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and\r\nthey died before the LORD.\r\n\r\n10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,\r\nsaying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all\r\nthe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.\r\n\r\n10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the\r\nuncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren\r\nfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.\r\n\r\n10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the\r\ncamp; as Moses had said.\r\n\r\n10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his\r\nsons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,\r\nand lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the\r\nwhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.\r\n\r\n10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon\r\nyou. And they did according to the word of Moses.\r\n\r\n10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor\r\nstrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for\r\never throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference\r\nbetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that\r\nye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD\r\nhath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,\r\nhis sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the\r\nofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside\r\nthe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy\r\nplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons\xe2\x80\x99 due, of the sacrifices of\r\nthe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.\r\n\r\n10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean\r\nplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be\r\nthy due, and thy sons\xe2\x80\x99 due, which are given out of the sacrifices of\r\npeace offerings of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the\r\nofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering\r\nbefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons\xe2\x80\x99 with thee, by a\r\nstatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.\r\n\r\n10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,\r\nbehold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the\r\nsons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye\r\nnot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,\r\nand God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to\r\nmake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of\r\nit was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have\r\neaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.\r\n\r\n10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered\r\ntheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such\r\nthings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,\r\nshould it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when\r\nMoses heard that, he was content.\r\n\r\n11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,\r\n11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts\r\nwhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\r\n\r\n11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the\r\ncud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.\r\n\r\n11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or\r\nof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the\r\ncud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\r\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the\r\nhoof; he is unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,\r\nyet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\r\n\r\n11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not\r\ntouch; they are unclean to you.\r\n\r\n11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath\r\nfins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them\r\nshall ye eat.\r\n\r\n11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the\r\nrivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which\r\nis in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 They\r\nshall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their\r\nflesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\r\n\r\n11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be\r\nan abomination unto you.\r\n\r\n11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the\r\nfowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,\r\nand the ossifrage, and the ospray, 11:14 And the vulture, and the kite\r\nafter his kind; 11:15 Every raven after his kind; 11:16 And the owl,\r\nand the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17\r\nAnd the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 And\r\nthe swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 11:19 And the stork,\r\nthe heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\r\n\r\n11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an\r\nabomination unto you.\r\n\r\n11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth\r\nupon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon\r\nthe earth; 11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his\r\nkind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his\r\nkind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\r\n\r\n11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,\r\nshall be an abomination unto you.\r\n\r\n11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the\r\ncarcase of them shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash\r\nhis clothes, and be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not\r\nclovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one\r\nthat toucheth them shall be unclean.\r\n\r\n11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts\r\nthat go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their\r\ncarcase shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,\r\nand be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things\r\nthat creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise\r\nafter his kind, 11:30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the\r\nlizard, and the snail, and the mole.\r\n\r\n11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth\r\ntouch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n11:32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,\r\nit shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or\r\nskin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it\r\nmust be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it\r\nshall be cleansed.\r\n\r\n11:33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,\r\nwhatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.\r\n\r\n11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh\r\nshall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel\r\nshall be unclean.\r\n\r\n11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth\r\nshall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall\r\nbe broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of\r\nwater, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be\r\nunclean.\r\n\r\n11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which\r\nis to be sown, it shall be clean.\r\n\r\n11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their\r\ncarcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n11:39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the\r\ncarcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n11:40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,\r\nand be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it\r\nshall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n11:41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be\r\nan abomination; it shall not be eaten.\r\n\r\n11:42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all\r\nfour, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that\r\ncreep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an\r\nabomination.\r\n\r\n11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing\r\nthat creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,\r\nthat ye should be defiled thereby.\r\n\r\n11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify\r\nyourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye\r\ndefile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,\r\nto be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.\r\n\r\n11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every\r\nliving creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that\r\ncreepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between the\r\nunclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the\r\nbeast that may not be eaten.\r\n\r\n12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a\r\nman child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days\r\nof the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.\r\n\r\n12:3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be\r\ncircumcised.\r\n\r\n12:4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three\r\nand thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the\r\nsanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two\r\nweeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of\r\nher purifying threescore and six days.\r\n\r\n12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or\r\nfor a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt\r\noffering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,\r\nunto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:\r\n12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for\r\nher; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is\r\nthe law for her that hath born a male or a female.\r\n\r\n12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two\r\nturtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the\r\nother for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for\r\nher, and she shall be clean.\r\n\r\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man\r\nshall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,\r\nand it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he\r\nshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the\r\npriests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of\r\nthe flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the\r\nplague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague\r\nof leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him\r\nunclean.\r\n\r\n13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in\r\nsight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned\r\nwhite; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven\r\ndays: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,\r\nbehold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread\r\nnot in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:\r\n13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,\r\nbehold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in\r\nthe skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and\r\nhe shall wash his clothes, and be clean.\r\n\r\n13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he\r\nhath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of\r\nthe priest again.\r\n\r\n13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the\r\nskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.\r\n\r\n13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought\r\nunto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if\r\nthe rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,\r\nand there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosy\r\nin the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,\r\nand shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.\r\n\r\n13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy\r\ncover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to\r\nhis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shall\r\nconsider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he\r\nshall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned\r\nwhite: he is clean.\r\n\r\n13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.\r\n\r\n13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be\r\nunclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.\r\n\r\n13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he\r\nshall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,\r\nbehold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall\r\npronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.\r\n\r\n13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,\r\nand is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white\r\nrising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be\r\nshewed to the priest; 13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,\r\nit be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned\r\nwhite; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of\r\nleprosy broken out of the boil.\r\n\r\n13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\r\nhairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat\r\ndark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 And if it\r\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\r\nunclean: it is a plague.\r\n\r\n13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is\r\na burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\r\n\r\n13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot\r\nburning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,\r\nsomewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:\r\nand, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be\r\nin sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the\r\nburning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the\r\nplague of leprosy.\r\n\r\n13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white\r\nhair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but\r\nbe somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27\r\nAnd the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be\r\nspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him\r\nunclean: it is the plague of leprosy.\r\n\r\n13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the\r\nskin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the\r\npriest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the\r\nburning.\r\n\r\n13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;\r\n13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in\r\nsight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;\r\nthen the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a\r\nleprosy upon the head or beard.\r\n\r\n13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,\r\nit be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black\r\nhair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of\r\nthe scall seven days: 13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall\r\nlook on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be\r\nin it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the\r\nskin; 13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and\r\nthe priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:\r\n13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,\r\nbehold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper\r\nthan the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall\r\nwash his clothes, and be clean.\r\n\r\n13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;\r\n13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be\r\nspread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is\r\nunclean.\r\n\r\n13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is\r\nblack hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the\r\npriest shall pronounce him clean.\r\n\r\n13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright\r\nspots, even white bright spots; 13:39 Then the priest shall look: and,\r\nbehold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish\r\nwhite; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.\r\n\r\n13:40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet\r\nis he clean.\r\n\r\n13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head\r\ntoward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.\r\n\r\n13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white\r\nreddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising\r\nof the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald\r\nforehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 13:44 He\r\nis a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him\r\nutterly unclean; his plague is in his head.\r\n\r\n13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,\r\nand his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and\r\nshall cry, Unclean, unclean.\r\n\r\n13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be\r\ndefiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall\r\nhis habitation be.\r\n\r\n13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be\r\na woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 Whether it be in the\r\nwarp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any\r\nthing made of skin; 13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in\r\nthe garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in\r\nany thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto\r\nthe priest: 13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut\r\nup it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 And he shall look on the\r\nplague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,\r\neither in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that\r\nis made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.\r\n\r\n13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in\r\nwoollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for\r\nit is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.\r\n\r\n13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not\r\nspread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any\r\nthing of skin; 13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the\r\nthing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:\r\n13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is\r\nwashed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and\r\nthe plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the\r\nfire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.\r\n\r\n13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark\r\nafter the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or\r\nout of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 13:57 And if\r\nit appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or\r\nin any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that\r\nwherein the plague is with fire.\r\n\r\n13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of\r\nskin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from\r\nthem, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.\r\n\r\n13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen\r\nor linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to\r\npronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.\r\n\r\n14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 This shall be the law\r\nof the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the\r\npriest: 14:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the\r\npriest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in\r\nthe leper; 14:4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is\r\nto be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,\r\nand hyssop: 14:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be\r\nkilled in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:6 As for the living\r\nbird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the\r\nhyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the\r\nbird that was killed over the running water: 14:7 And he shall\r\nsprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,\r\nand shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose\r\ninto the open field.\r\n\r\n14:8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave\r\noff all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and\r\nafter that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of\r\nhis tent seven days.\r\n\r\n14:9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his\r\nhair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he\r\nshall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his\r\nflesh in water, and he shall be clean.\r\n\r\n14:10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without\r\nblemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three\r\ntenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and\r\none log of oil.\r\n\r\n14:11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that\r\nis to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation: 14:12 And the priest shall take\r\none he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of\r\noil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 14:13 And he\r\nshall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering\r\nand the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is\r\nthe priest\xe2\x80\x99s, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 14:14 And\r\nthe priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and\r\nthe priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is\r\nto be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the\r\ngreat toe of his right foot: 14:15 And the priest shall take some of\r\nthe log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 14:16\r\nAnd the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his\r\nleft hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times\r\nbefore the LORD: 14:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand\r\nshall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\r\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\r\ntoe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 14:18\r\nAnd the remnant of the oil that is in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s hand he shall pour\r\nupon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make\r\nan atonement for him before the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an\r\natonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and\r\nafterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 And the priest shall\r\noffer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the\r\npriest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.\r\n\r\n14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take\r\none lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for\r\nhim, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat\r\noffering, and a log of oil; 14:22 And two turtledoves, or two young\r\npigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin\r\noffering, and the other a burnt offering.\r\n\r\n14:23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto\r\nthe priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,\r\nbefore the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and\r\nthe log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering\r\nbefore the LORD: 14:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass\r\noffering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass\r\noffering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to\r\nbe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great\r\ntoe of his right foot: 14:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into\r\nthe palm of his own left hand: 14:27 And the priest shall sprinkle\r\nwith his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven\r\ntimes before the LORD: 14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that\r\nis in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be\r\ncleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe\r\nof his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass\r\noffering: 14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nhe shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an\r\natonement for him before the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young\r\npigeons, such as he can get; 14:31 Even such as he is able to get, the\r\none for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the\r\nmeat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is\r\nto be cleansed before the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose\r\nhand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.\r\n\r\n14:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:34 When\r\nye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a\r\npossession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of\r\nyour possession; 14:35 And he that owneth the house shall come and\r\ntell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague\r\nin the house: 14:36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the\r\nhouse, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that\r\nis in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go\r\nin to see the house: 14:37 And he shall look on the plague, and,\r\nbehold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow\r\nstrakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;\r\n14:38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the\r\nhouse, and shut up the house seven days: 14:39 And the priest shall\r\ncome again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague\r\nbe spread in the walls of the house; 14:40 Then the priest shall\r\ncommand that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and\r\nthey shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 14:41 And\r\nhe shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they\r\nshall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an\r\nunclean place: 14:42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in\r\nthe place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall\r\nplaister the house.\r\n\r\n14:43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after\r\nthat he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the\r\nhouse, and after it is plaistered; 14:44 Then the priest shall come\r\nand look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a\r\nfretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.\r\n\r\n14:45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the\r\ntimber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry\r\nthem forth out of the city into an unclean place.\r\n\r\n14:46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is\r\nshut up shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n14:47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he\r\nthat eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.\r\n\r\n14:48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold,\r\nthe plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was\r\nplaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because\r\nthe plague is healed.\r\n\r\n14:49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar\r\nwood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 14:50 And he shall kill the one of the\r\nbirds in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:51 And he shall take\r\nthe cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,\r\nand dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water,\r\nand sprinkle the house seven times: 14:52 And he shall cleanse the\r\nhouse with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with\r\nthe living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and\r\nwith the scarlet: 14:53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the\r\ncity into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it\r\nshall be clean.\r\n\r\n14:54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,\r\n14:55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 14:56 And for\r\na rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 14:57 To teach when\r\nit is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.\r\n\r\n15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 15:2 Speak\r\nunto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a\r\nrunning issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.\r\n\r\n15:3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh\r\nrun with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his\r\nuncleanness.\r\n\r\n15:4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and\r\nevery thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.\r\n\r\n15:5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe\r\nhimself in water, and be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n15:6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the\r\nissue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be\r\nunclean until the even.\r\n\r\n15:7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall\r\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the\r\neven.\r\n\r\n15:8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then\r\nhe shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean\r\nuntil the even.\r\n\r\n15:9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall\r\nbe unclean.\r\n\r\n15:10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be\r\nunclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall\r\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the\r\neven.\r\n\r\n15:11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not\r\nrinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe\r\nhimself in water, and be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n15:12 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue,\r\nshall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.\r\n\r\n15:13 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he\r\nshall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his\r\nclothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.\r\n\r\n15:14 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or\r\ntwo young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 15:15\r\nAnd the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the\r\nother for a burnt offering;

and before\r\nthe mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n16:15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the\r\npeople, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as\r\nhe did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy\r\nseat, and before the mercy seat: 16:16 And he shall make an atonement\r\nfor the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of\r\nIsrael, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so\r\nshall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth\r\namong them in the midst of their uncleanness.\r\n\r\n16:17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation\r\nwhen he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come\r\nout, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household,\r\nand for all the congregation of Israel.\r\n\r\n16:18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and\r\nmake an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,\r\nand of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar\r\nround about.\r\n\r\n16:19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven\r\ntimes, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the\r\nlive goat: 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of\r\nthe live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children\r\nof Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting\r\nthem upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of\r\na fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 And the goat shall bear upon him\r\nall their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go\r\nthe goat in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n16:23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,\r\nand shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went\r\ninto the holy place, and shall leave them there: 16:24 And he shall\r\nwash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments,\r\nand come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering\r\nof the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.\r\n\r\n16:25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.\r\n\r\n16:26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his\r\nclothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n16:27 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin\r\noffering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy\r\nplace, shall one carry forth without the camp;

he hath shed blood; and that man\r\nshall be cut off from among his people: 17:5 To the end that the\r\nchildren of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the\r\nopen field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door\r\nof the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them\r\nfor peace offerings unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n17:6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the\r\nLORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the\r\nfat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n17:7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after\r\nwhom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto\r\nthem throughout their generations.\r\n\r\n17:8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the\r\nhouse of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that\r\noffereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 17:9 And bringeth it not unto\r\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the\r\nLORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.\r\n\r\n17:10 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the\r\nstrangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I\r\nwill even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will\r\ncut him off from among his people.\r\n\r\n17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it\r\nto you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is\r\nthe blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.\r\n\r\n17:12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you\r\nshall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you\r\neat blood.\r\n\r\n17:13 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the\r\nstrangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast\r\nor fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,\r\nand cover it with dust.\r\n\r\n17:14 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life\r\nthereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat\r\nthe blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the\r\nblood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n17:15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that\r\nwhich was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or\r\na stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in\r\nwater, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.\r\n\r\n17:16 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh;

thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.\r\n\r\n18:16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife: it\r\nis thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness.\r\n\r\n18:17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her\r\ndaughter, neither shalt thou take her son\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, or her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near\r\nkinswomen: it is wickedness.\r\n\r\n18:18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to\r\nuncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.\r\n\r\n18:19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her\r\nnakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.\r\n\r\n18:20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbours wife,\r\nto defile thyself with her.\r\n\r\n18:21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to\r\nMolech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is\r\nabomination.\r\n\r\n18:23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself\r\ntherewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down\r\nthereto: it is confusion.\r\n\r\n18:24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all\r\nthese the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 18:25 And\r\nthe land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon\r\nit, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.\r\n\r\n18:26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall\r\nnot commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation,\r\nnor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 18:27 (For all these\r\nabominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and\r\nthe land is defiled;) 18:28 That the land spue not you out also, when\r\nye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.\r\n\r\n18:29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the\r\nsouls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.\r\n\r\n18:30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any\r\none of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and\r\nthat ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 19:2 Speak unto all the\r\ncongregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be\r\nholy: for I the LORD your God am holy.\r\n\r\n19:3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my\r\nsabbaths: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am\r\nthe LORD your God.\r\n\r\n19:5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye\r\nshall offer it at your own will.\r\n\r\n19:6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:\r\nand if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n19:7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;

lest\r\nthe land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.\r\n\r\n19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after\r\nwizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n19:32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of\r\nthe old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not\r\nvex him.\r\n\r\n19:34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one\r\nborn among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were\r\nstrangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in\r\nweight, or in measure.\r\n\r\n19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall\r\nye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my\r\njudgments, and do them: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:2 Again, thou shalt say\r\nto the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel,\r\nor of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his\r\nseed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the\r\nland shall stone him with stones.\r\n\r\n20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off\r\nfrom among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech,\r\nto defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.\r\n\r\n20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from\r\nthe man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:\r\n20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,\r\nand will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit\r\nwhoredom with Molech, from among their people.\r\n\r\n20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,\r\nand after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face\r\nagainst that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.\r\n\r\n20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD\r\nyour God.\r\n\r\n20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which\r\nsanctify you.\r\n\r\n20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be\r\nsurely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his\r\nblood shall be upon him.\r\n\r\n20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\neven he that committeth adultery with his neighbours wife, the\r\nadulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n20:11 And the man that lieth with his father\xe2\x80\x99s wife hath uncovered his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their\r\nblood shall be upon them.\r\n\r\n20:12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall\r\nsurely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall\r\nbe upon them.\r\n\r\n20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both\r\nof them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to\r\ndeath; their blood shall be upon them.\r\n\r\n20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they\r\nshall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no\r\nwickedness among you.\r\n\r\n20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:\r\nand ye shall slay the beast.\r\n\r\n20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,\r\nthou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to\r\ndeath; their blood shall be upon them.\r\n\r\n20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, or\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his\r\nnakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the\r\nsight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness; he\r\nshall bear his iniquity.\r\n\r\n20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and\r\nshall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she\r\nhath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be\r\ncut off from among their people.\r\n\r\n20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\r\nnor of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall\r\nbear their iniquity.\r\n\r\n20:20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s wife, he hath uncovered\r\nhis uncle\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\n20:21 And if a man shall take his brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife, it is an unclean\r\nthing: he hath uncovered his brother\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness; they shall be\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\n20:22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,\r\nand do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue\r\nyou not out.\r\n\r\n20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast\r\nout before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I\r\nabhorred them.\r\n\r\n20:24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I\r\nwill give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and\r\nhoney: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and\r\nunclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make\r\nyour souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living\r\nthing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as\r\nunclean.\r\n\r\n20:26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have\r\nsevered you from other people, that ye should be mine.\r\n\r\n20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a\r\nwizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with\r\nstones: their blood shall be upon them.\r\n\r\n21:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of\r\nAaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead\r\namong his people: 21:2 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that\r\nis, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his\r\ndaughter, and for his brother.\r\n\r\n21:3 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath\r\nhad no husband; for her may he be defiled.\r\n\r\n21:4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his\r\npeople, to profane himself.\r\n\r\n21:5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they\r\nshave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n21:6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of\r\ntheir God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread\r\nof their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.\r\n\r\n21:7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither\r\nshall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto\r\nhis God.\r\n\r\n21:8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of\r\nthy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify\r\nyou, am holy.\r\n\r\n21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing\r\nthe whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.\r\n\r\n21:10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose\r\nhead the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on\r\nthe garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 21:11\r\nNeither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his\r\nfather, or for his mother; 21:12 Neither shall he go out of the\r\nsanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the\r\nanointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.\r\n\r\n21:14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these\r\nshall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n21:15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the\r\nLORD do sanctify him.\r\n\r\n21:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 21:17 Speak unto Aaron,\r\nsaying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any\r\nblemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.\r\n\r\n21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not\r\napproach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any\r\nthing superfluous, 21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or\r\nbrokenhanded, 21:20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish\r\nin his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 21:21\r\nNo man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come\r\nnigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a\r\nblemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.\r\n\r\n21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of\r\nthe holy.\r\n\r\n21:23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the\r\naltar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries:\r\nfor I the LORD do sanctify them.\r\n\r\n21:24 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:2 Speak unto Aaron and\r\nto his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the\r\nchildren of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those\r\nthings which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your\r\ngenerations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of\r\nIsrael hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that\r\nsoul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a\r\nrunning issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.\r\nAnd whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man\r\nwhose seed goeth from him; 22:5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping\r\nthing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take\r\nuncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 22:6 The soul which hath\r\ntouched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the\r\nholy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.\r\n\r\n22:7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward\r\neat of the holy things; because it is his food.\r\n\r\n22:8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not\r\neat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for\r\nit, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of\r\nthe priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.\r\n\r\n22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of\r\nit, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.\r\n\r\n22:12 If the priest\xe2\x80\x99s daughter also be married unto a stranger, she\r\nmay not eat of an offering of the holy things.\r\n\r\n22:13 But if the priest\xe2\x80\x99s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have\r\nno child, and is returned unto her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, as in her youth,\r\nshe shall eat of her father\xe2\x80\x99s meat: but there shall be no stranger eat\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n22:14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall\r\nput the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest\r\nwith the holy thing.\r\n\r\n22:15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of\r\nIsrael, which they offer unto the LORD; 22:16 Or suffer them to bear\r\nthe iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the\r\nLORD do sanctify them.\r\n\r\n22:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:18 Speak unto Aaron,\r\nand to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto\r\nthem, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in\r\nIsrael, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his\r\nfreewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt\r\noffering; 22:19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without\r\nblemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.\r\n\r\n22:20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it\r\nshall not be acceptable for you.\r\n\r\n22:21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the\r\nLORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep,\r\nit shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.\r\n\r\n22:22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or\r\nscabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering\r\nby fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or\r\nlacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;\r\nbut for a vow it shall not be accepted.\r\n\r\n22:24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or\r\ncrushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof\r\nin your land.\r\n\r\n22:25 Neither from a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hand shall ye offer the bread of your\r\nGod of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and\r\nblemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.\r\n\r\n22:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:27 When a bullock, or\r\na sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days\r\nunder the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be\r\naccepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:28 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her\r\nyoung both in one day.\r\n\r\n22:29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the\r\nLORD, offer it at your own will.\r\n\r\n22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it\r\nuntil the morrow: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed\r\namong the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you, 22:33\r\nThat brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n23:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the\r\nLORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are\r\nmy feasts.\r\n\r\n23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath\r\nof rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the\r\nsabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.\r\n\r\n23:4 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which\r\nye shall proclaim in their seasons.\r\n\r\n23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassover.\r\n\r\n23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of\r\nunleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do\r\nno servile work therein.\r\n\r\n23:8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven\r\ndays: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no\r\nservile work therein.\r\n\r\n23:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:10 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land\r\nwhich I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye\r\nshall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the\r\npriest: 23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be\r\naccepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall\r\nwave it.\r\n\r\n23:12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb\r\nwithout blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine\r\nflour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a\r\nsweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the\r\nfourth part of an hin.\r\n\r\n23:14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green\r\nears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto\r\nyour God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations\r\nin all your dwellings.\r\n\r\n23:15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,\r\nfrom the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven\r\nsabbaths shall be complete: 23:16 Even unto the morrow after the\r\nseventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new\r\nmeat offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two\r\ntenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with\r\nleaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of\r\nthe first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for\r\na burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their\r\ndrink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n23:19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,\r\nand two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.\r\n\r\n23:20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits\r\nfor a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be\r\nholy to the LORD for the priest.\r\n\r\n23:21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an\r\nholy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it\r\nshall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n23:22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make\r\nclean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither\r\nshalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them\r\nunto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n23:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:24 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of\r\nthe month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,\r\nan holy convocation.\r\n\r\n23:25 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an\r\noffering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:27 Also on the tenth\r\nday of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall\r\nbe an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and\r\noffer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of\r\natonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n23:29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that\r\nsame day, he shall be cut off from among his people.\r\n\r\n23:30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,\r\nthe same soul will I destroy from among his people.\r\n\r\n23:31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever\r\nthroughout your generations in all your dwellings.\r\n\r\n23:32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict\r\nyour souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto\r\neven, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.\r\n\r\n23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:34 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month\r\nshall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no\r\nservile work therein.\r\n\r\n23:36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the\r\nLORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye\r\nshall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn\r\nassembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.\r\n\r\n23:37 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be\r\nholy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a\r\nburnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings,\r\nevery thing upon his day: 23:38 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and\r\nbeside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your\r\nfreewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have\r\ngathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD\r\nseven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day\r\nshall be a sabbath.\r\n\r\n23:40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly\r\ntrees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and\r\nwillows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God\r\nseven days.\r\n\r\n23:41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIt shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate\r\nit in the seventh month.\r\n\r\n23:42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites\r\nborn shall dwell in booths: 23:43 That your generations may know that\r\nI made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them\r\nout of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n24:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:2 Command the children\r\nof Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the\r\nlight, to cause the lamps to burn continually.\r\n\r\n24:3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning\r\nbefore the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n24:4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the\r\nLORD continually.\r\n\r\n24:5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:\r\ntwo tenth deals shall be in one cake.\r\n\r\n24:6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure\r\ntable before the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may\r\nbe on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n24:8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD\r\ncontinually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting\r\ncovenant.\r\n\r\n24:9 And it shall be Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s and his sons\xe2\x80\x99; and they shall eat it in\r\nthe holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the\r\nLORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.\r\n\r\n24:10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an\r\nEgyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the\r\nIsraelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;\r\n24:11 And the Israelitish woman\xe2\x80\x99s son blasphemed the name of the Lord,\r\nand cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nwas Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 24:12 And\r\nthey put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.\r\n\r\n24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:14 Bring forth him\r\nthat hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay\r\ntheir hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.\r\n\r\n24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,\r\nWhosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.\r\n\r\n24:16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be\r\nput to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as\r\nwell the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth\r\nthe name of the Lord, shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n24:17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n24:18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.\r\n\r\n24:19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,\r\nso shall it be done to him; 24:20 Breach for breach, eye for eye,\r\ntooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be\r\ndone to him again.\r\n\r\n24:21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that\r\nkilleth a man, he shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n24:22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as\r\nfor one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n24:23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should\r\nbring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with\r\nstones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 25:2 Speak\r\nunto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the\r\nland which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt\r\nprune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 25:4 But in the\r\nseventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for\r\nthe LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.\r\n\r\n25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt\r\nnot reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a\r\nyear of rest unto the land.\r\n\r\n25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and\r\nfor thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for\r\nthy stranger that sojourneth with thee.\r\n\r\n25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall\r\nall the increase thereof be meat.\r\n\r\n25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven\r\ntimes seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall\r\nbe unto thee forty and nine years.\r\n\r\n25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the\r\ntenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make\r\nthe trumpet sound throughout all your land.\r\n\r\n25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty\r\nthroughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be\r\na jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,\r\nand ye shall return every man unto his family.\r\n\r\n25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,\r\nneither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes\r\nin it of thy vine undressed.\r\n\r\n25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat\r\nthe increase thereof out of the field.\r\n\r\n25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of\r\nthy neighbours hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 25:15\r\nAccording to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of\r\nthy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he\r\nshall sell unto thee: 25:16 According to the multitude of years thou\r\nshalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of\r\nyears thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number\r\nof the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.\r\n\r\n25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear\r\nthy God:for I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do\r\nthem; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.\r\n\r\n25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,\r\nand dwell therein in safety.\r\n\r\n25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,\r\nwe shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 Then I will\r\ncommand my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring\r\nforth fruit for three years.\r\n\r\n25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until\r\nthe ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for\r\nye are strangers and sojourners with me.\r\n\r\n25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a\r\nredemption for the land.\r\n\r\n25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his\r\npossession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he\r\nredeem that which his brother sold.\r\n\r\n25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to\r\nredeem it; 25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and\r\nrestore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may\r\nreturn unto his possession.\r\n\r\n25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is\r\nsold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the\r\nyear of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return\r\nunto his possession.\r\n\r\n25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may\r\nredeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may\r\nhe redeem it.\r\n\r\n25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then\r\nthe house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to\r\nhim that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in\r\nthe jubile.\r\n\r\n25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about\r\nthem shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be\r\nredeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.\r\n\r\n25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the\r\ncities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.\r\n\r\n25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was\r\nsold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of\r\njubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their\r\npossession among the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;\r\nfor it is their perpetual possession.\r\n\r\n25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;\r\nthen thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a\r\nsojourner; that he may live with thee.\r\n\r\n25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that\r\nthy brother may live with thee.\r\n\r\n25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy\r\nvictuals for increase.\r\n\r\n25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land\r\nof Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.\r\n\r\n25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be\r\nsold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:\r\n25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with\r\nthee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.\r\n\r\n25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children\r\nwith him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the\r\npossession of his fathers shall he return.\r\n\r\n25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land\r\nof Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.\r\n\r\n25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,\r\nshall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy\r\nbondmen and bondmaids.\r\n\r\n25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among\r\nyou, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,\r\nwhich they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.\r\n\r\n25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after\r\nyou, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for\r\never: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule\r\none over another with rigour.\r\n\r\n25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother\r\nthat dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or\r\nsojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s family: 25:48\r\nAfter that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren\r\nmay redeem him: 25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s son, may redeem\r\nhim, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;\r\nor if he be able, he may redeem himself.\r\n\r\n25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that\r\nhe was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale\r\nshall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of\r\nan hired servant shall it be with him.\r\n\r\n25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall\r\ngive again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was\r\nbought for.\r\n\r\n25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then\r\nhe shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give\r\nhim again the price of his redemption.\r\n\r\n25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the\r\nother shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.\r\n\r\n25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out\r\nin the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.\r\n\r\n25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my\r\nservants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD\r\nyour God.\r\n\r\n26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up\r\na standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your\r\nland, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;\r\n26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield\r\nher increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.\r\n\r\n26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage\r\nshall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the\r\nfull, and dwell in your land safely.\r\n\r\n26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and\r\nnone shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the\r\nland, neither shall the sword go through your land.\r\n\r\n26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you\r\nby the sword.\r\n\r\n26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you\r\nshall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before\r\nyou by the sword.\r\n\r\n26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and\r\nmultiply you, and establish my covenant with you.\r\n\r\n26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of\r\nthe new.\r\n\r\n26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be\r\nmy people.\r\n\r\n26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land\r\nof Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the\r\nbands of your yoke, and made you go upright.\r\n\r\n26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these\r\ncommandments; 26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your\r\nsoul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,\r\nbut that ye break my covenant: 26:16 I also will do this unto you; I\r\nwill even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,\r\nthat shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall\r\nsow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.\r\n\r\n26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before\r\nyour enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall\r\nflee when none pursueth you.\r\n\r\n26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will\r\npunish you seven times more for your sins.\r\n\r\n26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your\r\nheaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 And your strength shall\r\nbe spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither\r\nshall the trees of the land yield their fruits.\r\n\r\n26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I\r\nwill bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.\r\n\r\n26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of\r\nyour children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number;\r\nand your high ways shall be desolate.\r\n\r\n26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will\r\nwalk contrary unto me; 26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you,\r\nand will punish you yet seven times for your sins.\r\n\r\n26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel\r\nof my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities,\r\nI will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into\r\nthe hand of the enemy.\r\n\r\n26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall\r\nbake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread\r\nagain by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.\r\n\r\n26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk\r\ncontrary unto me; 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in\r\nfury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.\r\n\r\n26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your\r\ndaughters shall ye eat.\r\n\r\n26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,\r\nand cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul\r\nshall abhor you.\r\n\r\n26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries\r\nunto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.\r\n\r\n26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies\r\nwhich dwell therein shall be astonished at it.\r\n\r\n26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a\r\nsword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth\r\ndesolate, and ye be in your enemies\xe2\x80\x99 land; even then shall the land\r\nrest, and enjoy her sabbaths.\r\n\r\n26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not\r\nrest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.\r\n\r\n26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness\r\ninto their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a\r\nshaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a\r\nsword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.\r\n\r\n26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,\r\nwhen none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your\r\nenemies shall eat you up.\r\n\r\n26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity\r\nin your enemies\xe2\x80\x99 lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers\r\nshall they pine away with them.\r\n\r\n26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their\r\nfathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and\r\nthat also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I also\r\nhave walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of\r\ntheir enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they\r\nthen accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will I\r\nremember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and\r\nalso my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her\r\nsabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept\r\nof the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they\r\ndespised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.\r\n\r\n26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,\r\nI will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them\r\nutterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their\r\nancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight\r\nof the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD\r\nmade between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand\r\nof Moses.\r\n\r\n27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a\r\nsingular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.\r\n\r\n27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old\r\neven unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels\r\nof silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty\r\nshekels.\r\n\r\n27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then\r\nthy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female\r\nten shekels.\r\n\r\n27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy\r\nestimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the\r\nfemale thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.\r\n\r\n27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,\r\nthen thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten\r\nshekels.\r\n\r\n27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present\r\nhimself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according\r\nto his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.\r\n\r\n27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the\r\nLORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.\r\n\r\n27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad\r\nfor a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and\r\nthe exchange thereof shall be holy.\r\n\r\n27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a\r\nsacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the\r\npriest: 27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or\r\nbad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.\r\n\r\n27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part\r\nthereof unto thy estimation.\r\n\r\n27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the\r\nLORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as\r\nthe priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.\r\n\r\n27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he\r\nshall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and\r\nit shall be his.\r\n\r\n27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field\r\nof his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed\r\nthereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to\r\nthy estimation it shall stand.\r\n\r\n27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest\r\nshall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,\r\neven unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\n27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,\r\nthen he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto\r\nit, and it shall be assured to him.\r\n\r\n27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the\r\nfield to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.\r\n\r\n27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy\r\nunto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath\r\nbought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then the\r\npriest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto\r\nthe year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that\r\nday, as a holy thing unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of\r\nwhom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\n27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the\r\nsanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.\r\n\r\n27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is\r\nthe LORD\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it\r\naccording to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it\r\nthereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to\r\nthy estimation.\r\n\r\n27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto\r\nthe LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field\r\nof his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is\r\nmost holy unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;\r\nbut shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,\r\nor of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s: it is holy unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall\r\nadd thereto the fifth part thereof.\r\n\r\n27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of\r\nwhatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he\r\nchange it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change\r\nthereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.\r\n\r\n27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for\r\nthe children of Israel in mount Sinai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Book of Moses:  Called Numbers\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month,\r\nin the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,\r\nsaying, 1:2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of\r\nIsrael, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the\r\nnumber of their names, every male by their polls; 1:3 From twenty\r\nyears old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel:\r\nthou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.\r\n\r\n1:4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head\r\nof the house of his fathers.\r\n\r\n1:5 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of\r\nthe tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.\r\n\r\n1:6 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\r\n\r\n1:7 Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab.\r\n\r\n1:8 Of Issachar; Nethaneel the son of Zuar.\r\n\r\n1:9 Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon.\r\n\r\n1:10 Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of\r\nAmmihud: of Manasseh;

and of\r\nthe dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take,\r\nand put it into the water: 5:18 And the priest shall set the woman\r\nbefore the LORD, and uncover the woman\xe2\x80\x99s head, and put the offering of\r\nmemorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest\r\nshall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: 5:19\r\nAnd the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If\r\nno man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to\r\nuncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from\r\nthis bitter water that causeth the curse: 5:20 But if thou hast gone\r\naside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and\r\nsome man have lain with thee beside thine husband: 5:21 Then the\r\npriest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest\r\nshall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among\r\nthy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to\r\nswell; 5:22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy\r\nbowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the\r\nwoman shall say, Amen, amen.\r\n\r\n5:23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall\r\nblot them out with the bitter water: 5:24 And he shall cause the woman\r\nto drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that\r\ncauseth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.\r\n\r\n5:25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer\r\nit upon the altar: 5:26 And the priest shall take an handful of the\r\noffering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and\r\nafterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.\r\n\r\n5:27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come\r\nto pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her\r\nhusband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,\r\nand become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot:\r\nand the woman shall be a curse among her people.\r\n\r\n5:28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be\r\nfree, and shall conceive seed.\r\n\r\n5:29 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another\r\ninstead of her husband, and is defiled; 5:30 Or when the spirit of\r\njealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall\r\nset the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her\r\nall this law.\r\n\r\n5:31 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman\r\nshall bear her iniquity.\r\n\r\n6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 Speak unto the children\r\nof Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate\r\nthemselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the\r\nLORD: 6:3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and\r\nshall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither\r\nshall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.\r\n\r\n6:4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made\r\nof the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.\r\n\r\n6:5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor\r\ncome upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he\r\nseparateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the\r\nlocks of the hair of his head grow.\r\n\r\n6:6 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall\r\ncome at no dead body.\r\n\r\n6:7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his\r\nmother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the\r\nconsecration of his God is upon his head.\r\n\r\n6:8 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the\r\nhead of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of\r\nhis cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.\r\n\r\n6:10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young\r\npigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation: 6:11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin\r\noffering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement\r\nfor him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head\r\nthat same day.\r\n\r\n6:12 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation,\r\nand shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but\r\nthe days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was\r\ndefiled.\r\n\r\n6:13 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his\r\nseparation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation: 6:14 And he shall offer his offering\r\nunto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a\r\nburnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for\r\na sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 6:15\r\nAnd a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with\r\noil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat\r\noffering, and their drink offerings.\r\n\r\n6:16 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer\r\nhis sin offering, and his burnt offering: 6:17 And he shall offer the\r\nram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket\r\nof unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering,\r\nand his drink offering.\r\n\r\n6:18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the\r\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of\r\nthe head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the\r\nsacrifice of the peace offerings.\r\n\r\n6:19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one\r\nunleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall\r\nput them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his\r\nseparation is shaven: 6:20 And the priest shall wave them for a wave\r\noffering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave\r\nbreast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.\r\n\r\n6:21 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his\r\noffering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand\r\nshall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after\r\nthe law of his separation.\r\n\r\n6:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:23 Speak unto Aaron and\r\nunto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of\r\nIsrael, saying unto them, 6:24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:\r\n6:25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto\r\nthee: 6:26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n6:27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I\r\nwill bless them.\r\n\r\n7:1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the\r\ntabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the\r\ninstruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and\r\nhad anointed them, and sanctified them;

This was the dedication of the altar,\r\nafter that it was anointed.\r\n\r\n7:89 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation\r\nto speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him\r\nfrom off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from\r\nbetween the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.\r\n\r\n8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Speak unto Aaron and\r\nsay unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give\r\nlight over against the candlestick.\r\n\r\n8:3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the\r\ncandlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n8:4 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the\r\nshaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according\r\nunto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the\r\ncandlestick.\r\n\r\n8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:6 Take the Levites from\r\namong the children of Israel, and cleanse them.\r\n\r\n8:7 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water\r\nof purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let\r\nthem wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.\r\n\r\n8:8 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even\r\nfine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take\r\nfor a sin offering.\r\n\r\n8:9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children\r\nof Israel together: 8:10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the\r\nLORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the\r\nLevites: 8:11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an\r\noffering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the\r\nbullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the\r\nother for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for\r\nthe Levites.\r\n\r\n8:13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,\r\nand offer them for an offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of\r\nIsrael: and the Levites shall be mine.\r\n\r\n8:15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer\r\nthem for an offering.\r\n\r\n8:16 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of\r\nIsrael; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the\r\nfirstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.\r\n\r\n8:17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both\r\nman and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of\r\nEgypt I sanctified them for myself.\r\n\r\n8:18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n8:19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons\r\nfrom among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children\r\nof Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an\r\natonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among\r\nthe children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n8:20 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of\r\nIsrael, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded\r\nMoses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.\r\n\r\n8:21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and\r\nAaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an\r\natonement for them to cleanse them.\r\n\r\n8:22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as\r\nthe LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n8:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:24 This is it that\r\nbelongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward\r\nthey shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation: 8:25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease\r\nwaiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: 8:26 But\r\nshall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt\r\nthou do unto the Levites touching their charge.\r\n\r\n9:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the\r\nfirst month of the second year after they were come out of the land of\r\nEgypt, saying, 9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover\r\nat his appointed season.\r\n\r\n9:3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in\r\nhis appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according\r\nto all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.\r\n\r\n9:4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep\r\nthe passover.\r\n\r\n9:5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first\r\nmonth at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the\r\nLORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a\r\nman, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came\r\nbefore Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said unto\r\nhim, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept\r\nback, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed\r\nseason among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,\r\nStand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity\r\nshall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar\r\noff, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep\r\nit, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.\r\n\r\n9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone\r\nof it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep\r\nit.\r\n\r\n9:13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and\r\nforbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off\r\nfrom among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD\r\nin his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.\r\n\r\n9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the\r\npassover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover,\r\nand according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one\r\nordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud\r\ncovered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even\r\nthere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance\r\nof fire by night.\r\n\r\n9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after\r\nthat the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the\r\ncloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.\r\n\r\n9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,\r\nand at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud\r\nabode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.\r\n\r\n9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,\r\nthen the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;\r\naccording to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,\r\nand according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.\r\n\r\n9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,\r\nand that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:\r\nwhether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they\r\njourneyed.\r\n\r\n9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the\r\ncloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of\r\nIsrael abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken\r\nup, they journeyed.\r\n\r\n9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at\r\nthe commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of\r\nthe LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n10:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee two\r\ntrumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou\r\nmayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the\r\njourneying of the camps.\r\n\r\n10:3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall\r\nassemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which\r\nare heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts\r\nshall go forward.\r\n\r\n10:6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on\r\nthe south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for\r\ntheir journeys.\r\n\r\n10:7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall\r\nblow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.\r\n\r\n10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;\r\nand they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that\r\noppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye\r\nshall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved\r\nfrom your enemies.\r\n\r\n10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and\r\nin the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over\r\nyour burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;\r\nthat they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD\r\nyour God.\r\n\r\n10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in\r\nthe second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle\r\nof the testimony.\r\n\r\n10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the\r\nwilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.\r\n\r\n10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment\r\nof the LORD by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children\r\nof Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the\r\nson of Amminadab.\r\n\r\n10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was\r\nNethaneel the son of Zuar.\r\n\r\n10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was\r\nEliab the son of Helon.\r\n\r\n10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and\r\nthe sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to\r\ntheir armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.\r\n\r\n10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was\r\nShelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\r\n\r\n10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was\r\nEliasaph the son of Deuel.\r\n\r\n10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the\r\nother did set up the tabernacle against they came.\r\n\r\n10:22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set\r\nforward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the\r\nson of Ammihud.\r\n\r\n10:23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was\r\nGamaliel the son of Pedahzur.\r\n\r\n10:24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was\r\nAbidan the son of Gideoni.\r\n\r\n10:25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,\r\nwhich was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and\r\nover his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.\r\n\r\n10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was\r\nPagiel the son of Ocran.\r\n\r\n10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was\r\nAhira the son of Enan.\r\n\r\n10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to\r\ntheir armies, when they set forward.\r\n\r\n10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,\r\nMoses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the\r\nLORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee\r\ngood: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.\r\n\r\n10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine\r\nown land, and to my kindred.\r\n\r\n10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou\r\nknowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to\r\nus instead of eyes.\r\n\r\n10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what\r\ngoodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.\r\n\r\n10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days\xe2\x80\x99\r\njourney: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in\r\nthe three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey, to search out a resting place for them.\r\n\r\n10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went\r\nout of the camp.\r\n\r\n10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,\r\nRise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that\r\nhate thee flee before thee.\r\n\r\n10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many\r\nthousands of Israel.\r\n\r\n11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the\r\nLORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD\r\nburnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts\r\nof the camp.\r\n\r\n11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the\r\nLORD, the fire was quenched.\r\n\r\n11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of\r\nthe LORD burnt among them.\r\n\r\n11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and\r\nthe children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us\r\nflesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt\r\nfreely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,\r\nand the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing\r\nat all, beside this manna, before our eyes.\r\n\r\n11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as\r\nthe colour of bdellium.\r\n\r\n11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in\r\nmills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of\r\nit: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.\r\n\r\n11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,\r\nevery man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was\r\nkindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.\r\n\r\n11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy\r\nservant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou\r\nlayest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived\r\nall this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto\r\nme, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking\r\nchild, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13\r\nWhence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep\r\nunto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.\r\n\r\n11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too\r\nheavy for me.\r\n\r\n11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of\r\nhand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the\r\nelders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,\r\nand officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, that they may stand there with thee.\r\n\r\n11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take\r\nof the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they\r\nshall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not\r\nthyself alone.\r\n\r\n11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to\r\nmorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the\r\nLORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us\r\nin Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.\r\n\r\n11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither\r\nten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come\r\nout at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye\r\nhave despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,\r\nsaying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The\r\npeople, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou\r\nhast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.\r\n\r\n11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice\r\nthem?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,\r\nto suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to\r\npass unto thee or not.\r\n\r\n11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,\r\nand gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them\r\nround about the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took\r\nof the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:\r\nand it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they\r\nprophesied, and did not cease.\r\n\r\n11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the\r\none was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested\r\nupon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out\r\nunto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.\r\n\r\n11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and\r\nMedad do prophesy in the camp.\r\n\r\n11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his\r\nyoung men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.\r\n\r\n11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God\r\nthat all the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s people were prophets, and that the LORD would put\r\nhis spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and\r\nthe elders of Israel.\r\n\r\n11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails\r\nfrom the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney on this side, and as it were a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey on the other\r\nside, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the\r\nface of the earth.\r\n\r\n11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and\r\nall the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least\r\ngathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves\r\nround about the camp.\r\n\r\n11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was\r\nchewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the\r\nLORD smote the people with a very great plague.\r\n\r\n11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because\r\nthere they buried the people that lusted.\r\n\r\n11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;\r\nand abode at Hazeroth.\r\n\r\n12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian\r\nwoman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.\r\n\r\n12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he\r\nnot spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.\r\n\r\n12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were\r\nupon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto\r\nMoses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.\r\n\r\n12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in\r\nthe door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both\r\ncame forth.\r\n\r\n12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,\r\nI the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak\r\nunto him in a dream.\r\n\r\n12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.\r\n\r\n12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in\r\ndark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:\r\nwherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?\r\n12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,\r\nMiriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,\r\nand, behold, she was leprous.\r\n\r\n12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay\r\nnot the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we\r\nhave sinned.\r\n\r\n12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed\r\nwhen he cometh out of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb.\r\n\r\n12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I\r\nbeseech thee.\r\n\r\n12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her\r\nface, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from\r\nthe camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.\r\n\r\n12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people\r\njourneyed not till Miriam was brought in again.\r\n\r\n12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in\r\nthe wilderness of Paran.\r\n\r\n13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that\r\nthey may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of\r\nIsrael: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one\r\na ruler among them.\r\n\r\n13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the\r\nwilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the\r\nson of Zaccur.\r\n\r\n13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.\r\n\r\n13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.\r\n\r\n13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.\r\n\r\n13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.\r\n\r\n13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.\r\n\r\n13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.\r\n\r\n13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi\r\nthe son of Susi.\r\n\r\n13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.\r\n\r\n13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.\r\n\r\n13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.\r\n\r\n13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\r\n\r\n13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnd Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.\r\n\r\n13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto\r\nthem, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:\r\n13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth\r\ntherein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what\r\nthe land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what\r\ncities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong\r\nholds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether\r\nthere be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of\r\nthe fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\n13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of\r\nZin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.\r\n\r\n13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where\r\nAhiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron\r\nwas built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came unto\r\nthe brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one\r\ncluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they\r\nbrought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.\r\n\r\n13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of\r\ngrapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.\r\n\r\n13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.\r\n\r\n13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the\r\ncongregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,\r\nto Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the\r\ncongregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.\r\n\r\n13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou\r\nsentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the\r\nfruit of it.\r\n\r\n13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and\r\nthe cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the\r\nchildren of Anak there.\r\n\r\n13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,\r\nand the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the\r\nCanaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.\r\n\r\n13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go\r\nup at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\r\n\r\n13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up\r\nagainst the people; for they are stronger than we.\r\n\r\n13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had\r\nsearched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which\r\nwe have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants\r\nthereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great\r\nstature.\r\n\r\n13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the\r\ngiants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were\r\nin their sight.\r\n\r\n14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and\r\nthe people wept that night.\r\n\r\n14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against\r\nAaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we\r\nhad died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this\r\nwilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this\r\nland, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be\r\na prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And they\r\nsaid one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly\r\nof the congregation of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which\r\nwere of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And they\r\nspake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The\r\nland, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.\r\n\r\n14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,\r\nand give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.\r\n\r\n14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of\r\nthe land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from\r\nthem, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.\r\n\r\n14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the\r\nglory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation\r\nbefore all the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke\r\nme?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs\r\nwhich I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with the\r\npestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater\r\nnation and mightier than they.\r\n\r\n14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,\r\n(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)\r\n14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they\r\nhave heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art\r\nseen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that\r\nthou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a\r\npillar of fire by night.\r\n\r\n14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the\r\nnations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 14:16\r\nBecause the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which\r\nhe sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,\r\naccording as thou hast spoken, saying, 14:18 The LORD is\r\nlongsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and\r\ntransgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the\r\niniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according\r\nunto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this\r\npeople, from Egypt even until now.\r\n\r\n14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21\r\nBut as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,\r\nwhich I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now\r\nthese ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 14:23 Surely they\r\nshall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall\r\nany of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my servant Caleb,\r\nbecause he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,\r\nhim will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\n14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)\r\nTomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the\r\nRed sea.\r\n\r\n14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How\r\nlong shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against\r\nme? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they\r\nmurmur against me.\r\n\r\n14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have\r\nspoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 14:29 Your carcases shall\r\nfall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according\r\nto your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have\r\nmurmured against me.\r\n\r\n14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I\r\nsware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and\r\nJoshua the son of Nun.\r\n\r\n14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will\r\nI bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.\r\n\r\n14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,\r\nand bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even\r\nforty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even\r\nforty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.\r\n\r\n14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil\r\ncongregation, that are gathered together against me: in this\r\nwilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.\r\n\r\n14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,\r\nand made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a\r\nslander upon the land, 14:37 Even those men that did bring up the evil\r\nreport upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which\r\nwere of the men that went to search the land, lived still.\r\n\r\n14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:\r\nand the people mourned greatly.\r\n\r\n14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the\r\ntop of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the\r\nplace which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.\r\n\r\n14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment\r\nof the LORD? but it shall not prosper.\r\n\r\n14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten\r\nbefore your enemies.\r\n\r\n14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and\r\nye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,\r\ntherefore the LORD will not be with you.\r\n\r\n14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the\r\nark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in\r\nthat hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.\r\n\r\n15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land\r\nof your habitations, which I give unto you, 15:3 And will make an\r\noffering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in\r\nperforming a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,\r\nto make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:\r\n15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a\r\nmeat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of\r\nan hin of oil.\r\n\r\n15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt\r\nthou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.\r\n\r\n15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth\r\ndeals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.\r\n\r\n15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an\r\nhin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a\r\nsacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 15:9\r\nThen shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth\r\ndeals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.\r\n\r\n15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,\r\nfor an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a\r\nlamb, or a kid.\r\n\r\n15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to\r\nevery one according to their number.\r\n\r\n15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after\r\nthis manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour\r\nunto the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in\r\nyour generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet\r\nsavour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.\r\n\r\n15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and\r\nalso for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever\r\nin your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger\r\nthat sojourneth with you.\r\n\r\n15:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land\r\nwhither I bring you, 15:19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the\r\nbread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave\r\noffering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall\r\nye heave it.\r\n\r\n15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave\r\noffering in your generations.\r\n\r\n15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,\r\nwhich the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORD\r\nhath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Then\r\nit shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge\r\nof the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young\r\nbullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with\r\nhis meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,\r\nand one kid of the goats for a sin offering.\r\n\r\n15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation\r\nof the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is\r\nignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by\r\nfire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their\r\nignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the\r\nchildren of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;\r\nseeing all the people were in ignorance.\r\n\r\n15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she\r\ngoat of the first year for a sin offering.\r\n\r\n15:28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth\r\nignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an\r\natonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.\r\n\r\n15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,\r\nboth for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the\r\nstranger that sojourneth among them.\r\n\r\n15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born\r\nin the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that\r\nsoul shall be cut off from among his people.\r\n\r\n15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken\r\nhis commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity\r\nshall be upon him.\r\n\r\n15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they\r\nfound a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.\r\n\r\n15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses\r\nand Aaron, and unto all the congregation.\r\n\r\n15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what\r\nshould be done to him.\r\n\r\n15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to\r\ndeath: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and\r\nstoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the\r\nborders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they\r\nput upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 15:39 And it\r\nshall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember\r\nall the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not\r\nafter your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a\r\nwhoring: 15:40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and\r\nbe holy unto your God.\r\n\r\n15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of\r\nEgypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,\r\nand Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,\r\nsons of Reuben, took men: 16:2 And they rose up before Moses, with\r\ncertain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of\r\nthe assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 16:3 And they\r\ngathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said\r\nunto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are\r\nholy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then\r\nlift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?  16:4 And\r\nwhen Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 16:5 And he spake unto\r\nKorah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will\r\nshew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near\r\nunto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And\r\nput fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:\r\nand it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be\r\nholy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.\r\n\r\n16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:\r\n16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel\r\nhath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near\r\nto himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to\r\nstand before the congregation to minister unto them?  16:10 And he\r\nhath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi\r\nwith thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  16:11 For which cause\r\nboth thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD:\r\nand what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?  16:12 And Moses sent\r\nto call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not\r\ncome up: 16:13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of\r\na land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,\r\nexcept thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  16:14 Moreover\r\nthou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,\r\nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the\r\neyes of these men? we will not come up.\r\n\r\n16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not\r\nthou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have\r\nI hurt one of them.\r\n\r\n16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before\r\nthe LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 16:17 And take every\r\nman his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD\r\nevery man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and\r\nAaron, each of you his censer.\r\n\r\n16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and\r\nlaid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation with Moses and Aaron.\r\n\r\n16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the\r\ndoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD\r\nappeared unto all the congregation.\r\n\r\n16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21\r\nSeparate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume\r\nthem in a moment.\r\n\r\n16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the\r\nspirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with\r\nall the congregation?  16:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\r\n16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the\r\ntabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\r\n\r\n16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the\r\nelders of Israel followed him.\r\n\r\n16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,\r\nfrom the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest\r\nye be consumed in all their sins.\r\n\r\n16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,\r\non every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door\r\nof their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me\r\nto do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.\r\n\r\n16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be\r\nvisited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent\r\nme.\r\n\r\n16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,\r\nand swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go\r\ndown quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have\r\nprovoked the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these\r\nwords, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 16:32 And\r\nthe earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,\r\nand all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.\r\n\r\n16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the\r\npit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of\r\nthem: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.\r\n\r\n16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two\r\nhundred and fifty men that offered incense.\r\n\r\n16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar\r\nthe son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the\r\nburning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.\r\n\r\n16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them\r\nmake them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered\r\nthem before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a\r\nsign unto the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they\r\nthat were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a\r\ncovering of the altar: 16:40 To be a memorial unto the children of\r\nIsrael, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near\r\nto offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his\r\ncompany: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel\r\nmurmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the\r\npeople of the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against\r\nMoses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the\r\nLORD appeared.\r\n\r\n16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from\r\namong this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And\r\nthey fell upon their faces.\r\n\r\n16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein\r\nfrom off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the\r\ncongregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone\r\nout from the LORD; the plague is begun.\r\n\r\n16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the\r\ncongregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and\r\nhe put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.\r\n\r\n16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was\r\nstayed.\r\n\r\n16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and\r\nseven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.\r\n\r\n16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation: and the plague was stayed.\r\n\r\n17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to\r\nthe house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the\r\nhouse of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man\xe2\x80\x99s name upon\r\nhis rod.\r\n\r\n17:3 And thou shalt write Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s name upon the rod of Levi: for one\r\nrod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.\r\n\r\n17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation\r\nbefore the testimony, where I will meet with you.\r\n\r\n17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the man\xe2\x80\x99s rod, whom I shall\r\nchoose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings\r\nof the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.\r\n\r\n17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of\r\ntheir princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to\r\ntheir fathers\xe2\x80\x99 houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was\r\namong their rods.\r\n\r\n17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\n17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the\r\ntabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of\r\nLevi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and\r\nyielded almonds.\r\n\r\n17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all\r\nthe children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.\r\n\r\n17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s rod again before the\r\ntestimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt\r\nquite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.\r\n\r\n17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.\r\n\r\n17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we\r\ndie, we perish, we all perish.\r\n\r\n17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD\r\nshall die: shall we be consumed with dying?  18:1 And the LORD said\r\nunto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house with thee shall\r\nbear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee\r\nshall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.\r\n\r\n18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy\r\nfather, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and\r\nminister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister\r\nbefore the tabernacle of witness.\r\n\r\n18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the\r\ntabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary\r\nand the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.\r\n\r\n18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:\r\nand a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.\r\n\r\n18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of\r\nthe altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among\r\nthe children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,\r\nto do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall\r\nserve: I have given your priest\xe2\x80\x99s office unto you as a service of\r\ngift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the\r\ncharge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the\r\nchildren of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the\r\nanointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.\r\n\r\n18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the\r\nfire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and\r\nevery sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs\r\nwhich they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for\r\nthy sons.\r\n\r\n18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat\r\nit: it shall be holy unto thee.\r\n\r\n18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all\r\nthe wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto\r\nthee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for\r\never: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.\r\n\r\n18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of\r\nthe wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the\r\nLORD, them have I given thee.\r\n\r\n18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring\r\nunto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house\r\nshall eat of it.\r\n\r\n18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.\r\n\r\n18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they\r\nbring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:\r\nnevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the\r\nfirstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.\r\n\r\n18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou\r\nredeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,\r\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.\r\n\r\n18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the\r\nfirstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt\r\nsprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an\r\noffering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as\r\nthe right shoulder are thine.\r\n\r\n18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children\r\nof Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy\r\ndaughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt\r\nfor ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.\r\n\r\n18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in\r\ntheir land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part\r\nand thine inheritance among the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in\r\nIsrael for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even\r\nthe service of the tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the\r\ntabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.\r\n\r\n18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a\r\nstatute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children\r\nof Israel they have no inheritance.\r\n\r\n18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an\r\nheave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:\r\ntherefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they\r\nshall have no inheritance.\r\n\r\n18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto the\r\nLevites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the\r\ntithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye\r\nshall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part\r\nof the tithe.\r\n\r\n18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as\r\nthough it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of\r\nthe winepress.\r\n\r\n18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all\r\nyour tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall\r\ngive thereof the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s heave offering to Aaron the priest.\r\n\r\n18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the\r\nLORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best\r\nthereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the\r\nincrease of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.\r\n\r\n18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for\r\nit is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved\r\nfrom it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of\r\nthe children of Israel, lest ye die.\r\n\r\n19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 This\r\nis the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,\r\nSpeak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer\r\nwithout spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:\r\n19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring\r\nher forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:\r\n19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,\r\nand sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation seven times: 19:5 And one shall burn the heifer in his\r\nsight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he\r\nburn: 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and\r\nscarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.\r\n\r\n19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his\r\nflesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the\r\npriest shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and\r\nbathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.\r\n\r\n19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,\r\nand lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be\r\nkept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of\r\nseparation: it is a purification for sin.\r\n\r\n19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his\r\nclothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,\r\nfor a statute for ever.\r\n\r\n19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the\r\nseventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third\r\nday, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.\r\n\r\n19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and\r\npurifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that\r\nsoul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was\r\nnot sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into\r\nthe tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.\r\n\r\n19:15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is\r\nunclean.\r\n\r\n19:16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the\r\nopen fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be\r\nunclean seven days.\r\n\r\n19:17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the\r\nburnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put\r\nthereto in a vessel: 19:18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and\r\ndip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the\r\nvessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that\r\ntouched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19:19 And the\r\nclean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on\r\nthe seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and\r\nwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at\r\neven.\r\n\r\n19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,\r\nthat soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he\r\nhath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath\r\nnot been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.\r\n\r\n19:21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that\r\nsprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that\r\ntoucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.\r\n\r\n19:22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and\r\nthe soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.\r\n\r\n20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,\r\ninto the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in\r\nKadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.\r\n\r\n20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered\r\nthemselves together against Moses and against Aaron.\r\n\r\n20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God\r\nthat we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!  20:4 And why\r\nhave ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,\r\nthat we and our cattle should die there?  20:5 And wherefore have ye\r\nmade us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?\r\nit is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;\r\nneither is there any water to drink.\r\n\r\n20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto\r\nthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon\r\ntheir faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.\r\n\r\n20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and\r\ngather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and\r\nspeak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his\r\nwater, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so\r\nthou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.\r\n\r\n20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.\r\n\r\n20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before\r\nthe rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch\r\nyou water out of this rock?  20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and\r\nwith his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out\r\nabundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.\r\n\r\n20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me\r\nnot, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore\r\nye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel\r\nstrove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.\r\n\r\n20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,\r\nThus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath\r\nbefallen us: 20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have\r\ndwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our\r\nfathers: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,\r\nand sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,\r\nbehold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17\r\nLet us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass\r\nthrough the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of\r\nthe water of the wells: we will go by the king\xe2\x80\x99s high way, we will not\r\nturn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come\r\nout against thee with the sword.\r\n\r\n20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high\r\nway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for\r\nit: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.\r\n\r\n20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out\r\nagainst him with much people, and with a strong hand.\r\n\r\n20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:\r\nwherefore Israel turned away from him.\r\n\r\n20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,\r\njourneyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.\r\n\r\n20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the\r\ncoast of the land of Edom, saying, 20:24 Aaron shall be gathered unto\r\nhis people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given\r\nunto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at\r\nthe water of Meribah.\r\n\r\n20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount\r\nHor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar\r\nhis son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount\r\nHor in the sight of all the congregation.\r\n\r\n20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon\r\nEleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and\r\nMoses and Eleazar came down from the mount.\r\n\r\n20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they\r\nmourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard\r\ntell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against\r\nIsrael, and took some of them prisoners.\r\n\r\n21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt\r\nindeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy\r\ntheir cities.\r\n\r\n21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up\r\nthe Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and\r\nhe called the name of the place Hormah.\r\n\r\n21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to\r\ncompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much\r\ndiscouraged because of the way.\r\n\r\n21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore\r\nhave ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there\r\nis no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this\r\nlight bread.\r\n\r\n21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit\r\nthe people; and much people of Israel died.\r\n\r\n21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for\r\nwe have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,\r\nthat he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set\r\nit upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is\r\nbitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.\r\n\r\n21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it\r\ncame to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the\r\nserpent of brass, he lived.\r\n\r\n21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.\r\n\r\n21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the\r\nwilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.\r\n\r\n21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.\r\n\r\n21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of\r\nArnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the\r\nAmorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the\r\nAmorites.\r\n\r\n21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What\r\nhe did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the\r\nstream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth\r\nupon the border of Moab.\r\n\r\n21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the\r\nLORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give\r\nthem water.\r\n\r\n21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:\r\n21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,\r\nby the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the\r\nwilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:\r\nand from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that\r\nis in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward\r\nJeshimon.\r\n\r\n21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,\r\nsaying, 21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the\r\nfields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the\r\nwell: but we will go along by the king\xe2\x80\x99s high way, until we be past\r\nthy borders.\r\n\r\n21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:\r\nbut Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against\r\nIsrael into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed\r\nhis land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for\r\nthe border of the children of Ammon was strong.\r\n\r\n21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the\r\ncities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.\r\n\r\n21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who\r\nhad fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out\r\nof his hand, even unto Arnon.\r\n\r\n21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,\r\nlet the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For there is a fire\r\ngone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed\r\nAr of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.\r\n\r\n21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath\r\ngiven his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto\r\nSihon king of the Amorites.\r\n\r\n21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and\r\nwe have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.\r\n\r\n21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.\r\n\r\n21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages\r\nthereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.\r\n\r\n21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the\r\nking of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the\r\nbattle at Edrei.\r\n\r\n21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered\r\nhim into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do\r\nto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at\r\nHeshbon.\r\n\r\n21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there\r\nwas none left him alive: and they possessed his land.\r\n\r\n22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains\r\nof Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.\r\n\r\n22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the\r\nAmorites.\r\n\r\n22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:\r\nand Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company\r\nlick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nAnd Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.\r\n\r\n22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to\r\nPethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his\r\npeople, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from\r\nEgypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over\r\nagainst me: 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this\r\npeople; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,\r\nthat we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for\r\nI wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest\r\nis cursed.\r\n\r\n22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the\r\nrewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and\r\nspake unto him the words of Balak.\r\n\r\n22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring\r\nyou word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of\r\nMoab abode with Balaam.\r\n\r\n22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?\r\n22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,\r\nhath sent unto me, saying, 22:11 Behold, there is a people come out of\r\nEgypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;\r\nperadventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.\r\n\r\n22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou\r\nshalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.\r\n\r\n22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of\r\nBalak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave\r\nto go with you.\r\n\r\n22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and\r\nsaid, Balaam refuseth to come with us.\r\n\r\n22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than\r\nthey.\r\n\r\n22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the\r\nson of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto\r\nme: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will\r\ndo whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse\r\nme this people.\r\n\r\n22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If\r\nBalak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go\r\nbeyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.\r\n\r\n22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I\r\nmay know what the LORD will say unto me more.\r\n\r\n22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men\r\ncome to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I\r\nshall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.\r\n\r\n22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went\r\nwith the princes of Moab.\r\n\r\n22:22 And God\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of\r\nthe LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was\r\nriding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.\r\n\r\n22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and\r\nhis sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,\r\nand went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a\r\nwall being on this side, and a wall on that side.\r\n\r\n22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself\r\nunto the wall, and crushed Balaam\xe2\x80\x99s foot against the wall: and he\r\nsmote her again.\r\n\r\n22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow\r\nplace, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under\r\nBalaam: and Balaam\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto\r\nBalaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these\r\nthree times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast\r\nmocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I\r\nkill thee.\r\n\r\n22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which\r\nthou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont\r\nto do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.\r\n\r\n22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of\r\nthe LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he\r\nbowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.\r\n\r\n22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou\r\nsmitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand\r\nthee, because thy way is perverse before me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,\r\nand turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,\r\nsurely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.\r\n\r\n22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I\r\nknew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if\r\nit displease thee, I will get me back again.\r\n\r\n22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but\r\nonly the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So\r\nBalaam went with the princes of Balak.\r\n\r\n22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet\r\nhim unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in\r\nthe utmost coast.\r\n\r\n22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee\r\nto call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed\r\nto promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am\r\ncome unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word\r\nthat God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.\r\n\r\n22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.\r\n\r\n22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the\r\nprinces that were with him.\r\n\r\n22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and\r\nbrought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see\r\nthe utmost part of the people.\r\n\r\n23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and\r\nprepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.\r\n\r\n23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered\r\non every altar a bullock and a ram.\r\n\r\n23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I\r\nwill go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he\r\nsheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.\r\n\r\n23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven\r\naltars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.\r\n\r\n23:5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and said, Return unto\r\nBalak, and thus thou shalt speak.\r\n\r\n23:6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt\r\nsacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.\r\n\r\n23:7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath\r\nbrought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,\r\ncurse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.\r\n\r\n23:8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,\r\nwhom the LORD hath not defied?  23:9 For from the top of the rocks I\r\nsee him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell\r\nalone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\r\n\r\n23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth\r\npart of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last\r\nend be like his!  23:11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou\r\ndone unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou\r\nhast blessed them altogether.\r\n\r\n23:12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that\r\nwhich the LORD hath put in my mouth?  23:13 And Balak said unto him,\r\nCome, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest\r\nsee them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not\r\nsee them all: and curse me them from thence.\r\n\r\n23:14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of\r\nPisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on\r\nevery altar.\r\n\r\n23:15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while\r\nI meet the LORD yonder.\r\n\r\n23:16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,\r\nGo again unto Balak, and say thus.\r\n\r\n23:17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,\r\nand the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath\r\nthe LORD spoken?  23:18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,\r\nBalak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 23:19 God is not\r\na man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should\r\nrepent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and\r\nshall he not make it good?  23:20 Behold, I have received commandment\r\nto bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.\r\n\r\n23:21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen\r\nperverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of\r\na king is among them.\r\n\r\n23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength\r\nof an unicorn.\r\n\r\n23:23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there\r\nany divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said\r\nof Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!  23:24 Behold, the\r\npeople shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young\r\nlion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the\r\nblood of the slain.\r\n\r\n23:25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless\r\nthem at all.\r\n\r\n23:26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,\r\nsaying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?  23:27 And Balak\r\nsaid unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another\r\nplace; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them\r\nfrom thence.\r\n\r\n23:28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh\r\ntoward Jeshimon.\r\n\r\n23:29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and\r\nprepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.\r\n\r\n23:30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a\r\nram on every altar.\r\n\r\n24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he\r\nwent not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his\r\nface toward the wilderness.\r\n\r\n24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his\r\ntents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.\r\n\r\n24:3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath\r\nsaid, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:4 He hath said,\r\nwhich heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty,\r\nfalling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 24:5 How goodly are\r\nthy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!  24:6 As the\r\nvalleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river\xe2\x80\x99s side, as the\r\ntrees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees\r\nbeside the waters.\r\n\r\n24:7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be\r\nin many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his\r\nkingdom shall be exalted.\r\n\r\n24:8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the\r\nstrength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and\r\nshall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.\r\n\r\n24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall\r\nstir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that\r\ncurseth thee.\r\n\r\n24:10 And Balak\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his\r\nhands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse\r\nmine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\n24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee\r\nunto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.\r\n\r\n24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers\r\nwhich thou sentest unto me, saying, 24:13 If Balak would give me his\r\nhouse full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of\r\nthe LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD\r\nsaith, that will I speak?  24:14 And now, behold, I go unto my people:\r\ncome therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to\r\nthy people in the latter days.\r\n\r\n24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor\r\nhath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:16 He hath\r\nsaid, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most\r\nHigh, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but\r\nhaving his eyes open: 24:17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall\r\nbehold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a\r\nSceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,\r\nand destroy all the children of Sheth.\r\n\r\n24:18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession\r\nfor his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.\r\n\r\n24:19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall\r\ndestroy him that remaineth of the city.\r\n\r\n24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,\r\nAmalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that\r\nhe perish for ever.\r\n\r\n24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,\r\nStrong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.\r\n\r\n24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall\r\ncarry thee away captive.\r\n\r\n24:23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when\r\nGod doeth this!  24:24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,\r\nand shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall\r\nperish for ever.\r\n\r\n24:25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and\r\nBalak also went his way.\r\n\r\n25:1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit\r\nwhoredom with the daughters of Moab.\r\n\r\n25:2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and\r\nthe people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.\r\n\r\n25:3 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the\r\nLORD was kindled against Israel.\r\n\r\n25:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,\r\nand hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce\r\nanger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.\r\n\r\n25:5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his\r\nmen that were joined unto Baalpeor.\r\n\r\n25:6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto\r\nhis brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the\r\nsight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were\r\nweeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n25:7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the\r\npriest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a\r\njavelin in his hand; 25:8 And he went after the man of Israel into the\r\ntent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the\r\nwoman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n25:9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.\r\n\r\n25:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:11 Phinehas, the son\r\nof Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away\r\nfrom the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among\r\nthem, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.\r\n\r\n25:12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:\r\n25:13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant\r\nof an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and\r\nmade an atonement for the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n25:14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was\r\nslain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince\r\nof a chief house among the Simeonites.\r\n\r\n25:15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,\r\nthe daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house\r\nin Midian.\r\n\r\n25:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:17 Vex the Midianites,\r\nand smite them: 25:18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith\r\nthey have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of\r\nCozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was\r\nslain in the day of the plague for Peor\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n26:1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto\r\nMoses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 26:2 Take\r\nthe sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty\r\nyears old and upward, throughout their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 house, all that are\r\nable to go to war in Israel.\r\n\r\n26:3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of\r\nMoab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 26:4 Take the sum of the people,\r\nfrom twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the\r\nchildren of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n26:5 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch,\r\nof whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of\r\nthe Palluites: 26:6 Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi,\r\nthe family of the Carmites.\r\n\r\n26:7 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were\r\nnumbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\n26:8 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.\r\n\r\n26:9 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram.

that the\r\ncongregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.\r\n\r\n27:18 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a\r\nman in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; 27:19 And set\r\nhim before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and\r\ngive him a charge in their sight.\r\n\r\n27:20 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the\r\ncongregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.\r\n\r\n27:21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask\r\ncounsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his\r\nword shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he,\r\nand all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.\r\n\r\n27:22 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and\r\nset him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:\r\n27:23 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the\r\nLORD commanded by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n28:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 28:2 Command the children\r\nof Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my\r\nsacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe\r\nto offer unto me in their due season.\r\n\r\n28:3 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire\r\nwhich ye shall offer unto the LORD;

he shall not break his word, he shall do according\r\nto all that proceedeth out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n30:3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a\r\nbond, being in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house in her youth; 30:4 And her father\r\nhear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her\r\nfather shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and\r\nevery bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.\r\n\r\n30:5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not\r\nany of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul,\r\nshall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father\r\ndisallowed her.\r\n\r\n30:6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered\r\nought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 30:7 And her\r\nhusband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard\r\nit: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her\r\nsoul shall stand.\r\n\r\n30:8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;\r\nthen he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered\r\nwith her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the\r\nLORD shall forgive her.\r\n\r\n30:9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith\r\nthey have bound their souls, shall stand against her.\r\n\r\n30:10 And if she vowed in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s house, or bound her soul by a\r\nbond with an oath; 30:11 And her husband heard it, and held his peace\r\nat her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and\r\nevery bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.\r\n\r\n30:12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he\r\nheard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her\r\nvows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband\r\nhath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.\r\n\r\n30:13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her\r\nhusband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.\r\n\r\n30:14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to\r\nday; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are\r\nupon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the\r\nday that he heard them.\r\n\r\n30:15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard\r\nthem; then he shall bear her iniquity.\r\n\r\n30:16 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between\r\na man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in\r\nher youth in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 Avenge the children\r\nof Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n31:3 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves\r\nunto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the\r\nLORD of Midian.\r\n\r\n31:4 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,\r\nshall ye send to the war.\r\n\r\n31:5 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a\r\nthousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.\r\n\r\n31:6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them\r\nand Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy\r\ninstruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.\r\n\r\n31:7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded\r\nMoses; and they slew all the males.\r\n\r\n31:8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that\r\nwere slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five\r\nkings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.\r\n\r\n31:9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,\r\nand their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all\r\ntheir flocks, and all their goods.\r\n\r\n31:10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all\r\ntheir goodly castles, with fire.\r\n\r\n31:11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and\r\nof beasts.\r\n\r\n31:12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto\r\nMoses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the\r\nchildren of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by\r\nJordan near Jericho.\r\n\r\n31:13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the\r\ncongregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.\r\n\r\n31:14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the\r\ncaptains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\n31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?\r\n31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel\r\nof Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,\r\nand there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill\r\nevery woman that hath known man by lying with him.\r\n\r\n31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying\r\nwith him, keep alive for yourselves.\r\n\r\n31:19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath\r\nkilled any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both\r\nyourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.\r\n\r\n31:20 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and\r\nall work of goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair, and all things made of wood.\r\n\r\n31:21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to\r\nthe battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded\r\nMoses; 31:22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the\r\ntin, and the lead, 31:23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall\r\nmake it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it\r\nshall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth\r\nnot the fire ye shall make go through the water.\r\n\r\n31:24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall\r\nbe clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.\r\n\r\n31:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:26 Take the sum of the\r\nprey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the\r\npriest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 31:27 And divide\r\nthe prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who\r\nwent out to battle, and between all the congregation: 31:28 And levy a\r\ntribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one\r\nsoul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of\r\nthe asses, and of the sheep: 31:29 Take it of their half, and give it\r\nunto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:30 And of the children of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s half, thou shalt take one\r\nportion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of\r\nthe flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,\r\nwhich keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded\r\nMoses.\r\n\r\n31:32 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war\r\nhad caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five\r\nthousand sheep, 31:33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 31:34\r\nAnd threescore and one thousand asses, 31:35 And thirty and two\r\nthousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n31:36 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to\r\nwar, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty\r\nthousand and five hundred sheep: 31:37 And the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s tribute of the\r\nsheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.\r\n\r\n31:38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntribute was threescore and twelve.\r\n\r\n31:39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which\r\nthe LORD\xe2\x80\x99s tribute was threescore and one.\r\n\r\n31:40 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntribute was thirty and two persons.\r\n\r\n31:41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s heave offering,\r\nunto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n31:42 And of the children of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s half, which Moses divided from\r\nthe men that warred, 31:43 (Now the half that pertained unto the\r\ncongregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven\r\nthousand and five hundred sheep, 31:44 And thirty and six thousand\r\nbeeves, 31:45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 31:46 And\r\nsixteen thousand persons;) 31:47 Even of the children of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and\r\ngave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of\r\nthe LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n31:48 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the\r\ncaptains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:\r\n31:49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the\r\nmen of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n31:50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every\r\nman hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,\r\nearrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all\r\nwrought jewels.\r\n\r\n31:52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the\r\nLORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,\r\nwas sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.\r\n\r\n31:53 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)\r\n31:54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains\r\nof thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very\r\ngreat multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and\r\nthe land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;\r\n32:2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake\r\nunto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the\r\ncongregation, saying, 32:3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,\r\nand Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 32:4 Even\r\nthe country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is\r\na land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 32:5 Wherefore, said\r\nthey, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto\r\nthy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.\r\n\r\n32:6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of\r\nReuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?  32:7\r\nAnd wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from\r\ngoing over into the land which the LORD hath given them?  32:8 Thus\r\ndid your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.\r\n\r\n32:9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the\r\nland, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they\r\nshould not go into the land which the LORD had given them.\r\n\r\n32:10 And the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,\r\nsaying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from\r\ntwenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto\r\nAbraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly\r\nfollowed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and\r\nJoshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.\r\n\r\n32:13 And the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made\r\nthem wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,\r\nthat had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.\r\n\r\n32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers\xe2\x80\x99 stead, an increase\r\nof sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n32:15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them\r\nin the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.\r\n\r\n32:16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds\r\nhere for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 32:17 But we\r\nourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we\r\nhave brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in\r\nthe fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\n32:18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel\r\nhave inherited every man his inheritance.\r\n\r\n32:19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or\r\nforward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan\r\neastward.\r\n\r\n32:20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will\r\ngo armed before the LORD to war, 32:21 And will go all of you armed\r\nover Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from\r\nbefore him, 32:22 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then\r\nafterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and\r\nbefore Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.\r\n\r\n32:23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the\r\nLORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.\r\n\r\n32:24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;\r\nand do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.\r\n\r\n32:25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto\r\nMoses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.\r\n\r\n32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,\r\nshall be there in the cities of Gilead: 32:27 But thy servants will\r\npass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my\r\nlord saith.\r\n\r\n32:28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and\r\nJoshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the\r\nchildren of Israel: 32:29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of\r\nGad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every\r\nman armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued\r\nbefore you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a\r\npossession: 32:30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they\r\nshall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n32:31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,\r\nsaying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.\r\n\r\n32:32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,\r\nthat the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be\r\nours.\r\n\r\n32:33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to\r\nthe children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of\r\nJoseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of\r\nOg king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,\r\neven the cities of the country round about.\r\n\r\n32:34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,\r\n32:35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 32:36 And\r\nBethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.\r\n\r\n32:37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and\r\nKirjathaim, 32:38 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,)\r\nand Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.\r\n\r\n32:39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,\r\nand took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.\r\n\r\n32:40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he\r\ndwelt therein.\r\n\r\n32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns\r\nthereof, and called them Havothjair.\r\n\r\n32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and\r\ncalled it Nobah, after his own name.\r\n\r\n33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went\r\nforth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of\r\nMoses and Aaron.\r\n\r\n33:2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by\r\nthe commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to\r\ntheir goings out.\r\n\r\n33:3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the\r\nfifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the\r\nchildren of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n33:4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had\r\nsmitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.\r\n\r\n33:5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in\r\nSuccoth.\r\n\r\n33:6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in\r\nthe edge of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n33:7 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,\r\nwhich is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.\r\n\r\n33:8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the\r\nmidst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days\xe2\x80\x99 journey in\r\nthe wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.\r\n\r\n33:9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were\r\ntwelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees;

according to\r\nthe tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.\r\n\r\n33:55 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from\r\nbefore you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain\r\nof them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and\r\nshall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.\r\n\r\n33:56 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I\r\nthought to do unto them.\r\n\r\n34:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:2 Command the children\r\nof Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan;\r\n(this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even\r\nthe land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 34:3 Then your south\r\nquarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of\r\nEdom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea\r\neastward: 34:4 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent\r\nof Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be\r\nfrom the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and\r\npass on to Azmon: 34:5 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon\r\nunto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.\r\n\r\n34:6 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea\r\nfor a border: this shall be your west border.\r\n\r\n34:7 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall\r\npoint out for you mount Hor: 34:8 From mount Hor ye shall point out\r\nyour border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the\r\nborder shall be to Zedad: 34:9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron,\r\nand the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your\r\nnorth border.\r\n\r\n34:10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to\r\nShepham: 34:11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on\r\nthe east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach\r\nunto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 34:12 And the border\r\nshall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt\r\nsea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.\r\n\r\n34:13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the\r\nland which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give\r\nunto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 34:14 For the tribe of\r\nthe children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and\r\nthe tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their\r\nfathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of\r\nManasseh have received their inheritance: 34:15 The two tribes and the\r\nhalf tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near\r\nJericho eastward, toward the sunrising.\r\n\r\n34:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:17 These are the names\r\nof the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest,\r\nand Joshua the son of Nun.\r\n\r\n34:18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land\r\nby inheritance.\r\n\r\n34:19 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb\r\nthe son of Jephunneh.\r\n\r\n34:20 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of\r\nAmmihud.\r\n\r\n34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.\r\n\r\n34:22 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the\r\nson of Jogli.\r\n\r\n34:23 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the\r\nchildren of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.\r\n\r\n34:24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel\r\nthe son of Shiphtan.\r\n\r\n34:25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,\r\nElizaphan the son of Parnach.\r\n\r\n34:26 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel\r\nthe son of Azzan.\r\n\r\n34:27 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the\r\nson of Shelomi.\r\n\r\n34:28 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel\r\nthe son of Ammihud.\r\n\r\n34:29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance\r\nunto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n35:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan\r\nnear Jericho, saying, 35:2 Command the children of Israel, that they\r\ngive unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to\r\ndwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the\r\ncities round about them.\r\n\r\n35:3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of\r\nthem shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\n35:4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the\r\nLevites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand\r\ncubits round about.\r\n\r\n35:5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two\r\nthousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the\r\nwest side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand\r\ncubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the\r\nsuburbs of the cities.\r\n\r\n35:6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there\r\nshall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the\r\nmanslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty\r\nand two cities.\r\n\r\n35:7 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be\r\nforty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.\r\n\r\n35:8 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of\r\nthe children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many;\r\nbut from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of\r\nhis cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he\r\ninheriteth.\r\n\r\n35:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 35:10 Speak unto the\r\nchildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan\r\ninto the land of Canaan; 35:11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be\r\ncities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which\r\nkilleth any person at unawares.\r\n\r\n35:12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;\r\nthat the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n35:13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have\r\nfor refuge.\r\n\r\n35:14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities\r\nshall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.\r\n\r\n35:15 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of\r\nIsrael, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that\r\nevery one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.\r\n\r\n35:16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die,\r\nhe is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n35:17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,\r\nand he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n35:18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may\r\ndie, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n35:19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he\r\nmeeteth him, he shall slay him.\r\n\r\n35:20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of\r\nwait, that he die; 35:21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he\r\ndie: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a\r\nmurderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he\r\nmeeteth him.\r\n\r\n35:22 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon\r\nhim any thing without laying of wait, 35:23 Or with any stone,\r\nwherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he\r\ndie, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 35:24 Then the\r\ncongregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood\r\naccording to these judgments: 35:25 And the congregation shall deliver\r\nthe slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the\r\ncongregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he\r\nwas fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest,\r\nwhich was anointed with the holy oil.\r\n\r\n35:26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of\r\nthe city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 35:27 And the revenger of\r\nblood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the\r\nrevenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:\r\n35:28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until\r\nthe death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest\r\nthe slayer shall return into the land of his possession.\r\n\r\n35:29 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you\r\nthroughout your generations in all your dwellings.\r\n\r\n35:30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by\r\nthe mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any\r\nperson to cause him to die.\r\n\r\n35:31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a\r\nmurderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n35:32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the\r\ncity of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land,\r\nuntil the death of the priest.\r\n\r\n35:33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it\r\ndefileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that\r\nis shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\r\n\r\n35:34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I\r\ndwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n36:1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead,\r\nthe son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of\r\nJoseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the\r\nchief fathers of the children of Israel: 36:2 And they said, The LORD\r\ncommanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the\r\nchildren of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the\r\ninheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.\r\n\r\n36:3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of\r\nthe children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the\r\ninheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the\r\ntribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot\r\nof our inheritance.\r\n\r\n36:4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then\r\nshall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe\r\nwhereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away\r\nfrom the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.\r\n\r\n36:5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word\r\nof the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.\r\n\r\n36:6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the\r\ndaughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think\r\nbest; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they\r\nmarry.\r\n\r\n36:7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove\r\nfrom tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall\r\nkeep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.\r\n\r\n36:8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe\r\nof the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the\r\ntribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man\r\nthe inheritance of his fathers.\r\n\r\n36:9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another\r\ntribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall\r\nkeep himself to his own inheritance.\r\n\r\n36:10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of\r\nZelophehad: 36:11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and\r\nNoah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrothers\xe2\x80\x99 sons: 36:12 And they were married into the families of the\r\nsons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in\r\nthe tribe of the family of their father.\r\n\r\n36:13 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD\r\ncommanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the\r\nplains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Book of Moses:  Called Deuteronomy\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side\r\nJordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,\r\nbetween Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.\r\n\r\n1:2 (There are eleven days\xe2\x80\x99 journey from Horeb by the way of mount\r\nSeir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth\r\nyear, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses\r\nspake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD\r\nhad given him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihon\r\nthe king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of\r\nBashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, in\r\nthe land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 1:6 The\r\nLORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough\r\nin this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the\r\nmount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the\r\nplain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea\r\nside, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great\r\nriver, the river Euphrates.\r\n\r\n1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land\r\nwhich the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to\r\ngive unto them and to their seed after them.\r\n\r\n1:9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear\r\nyou myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,\r\nbehold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.\r\n\r\n1:11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many\r\nmore as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How can\r\nI myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?\r\n1:13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your\r\ntribes, and I will make them rulers over you.\r\n\r\n1:14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is\r\ngood for us to do.\r\n\r\n1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made\r\nthem heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over\r\nhundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and\r\nofficers among your tribes.\r\n\r\n1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes\r\nbetween your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his\r\nbrother, and the stranger that is with him.\r\n\r\n1:17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the\r\nsmall as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;\r\nfor the judgment is God\xe2\x80\x99s: and the cause that is too hard for you,\r\nbring it unto me, and I will hear it.\r\n\r\n1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great\r\nand terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of\r\nthe Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to\r\nKadeshbarnea.\r\n\r\n1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the\r\nAmorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.\r\n\r\n1:21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and\r\npossess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear\r\nnot, neither be discouraged.\r\n\r\n1:22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send\r\nmen before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us\r\nword again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n1:23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one\r\nof a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and\r\ncame unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.\r\n\r\n1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and\r\nbrought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a\r\ngood land which the LORD our God doth give us.\r\n\r\n1:26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the\r\ncommandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,\r\nand said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of\r\nthe land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to\r\ndestroy us.\r\n\r\n1:28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,\r\nsaying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great\r\nand walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the\r\nAnakims there.\r\n\r\n1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.\r\n\r\n1:30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,\r\naccording to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 1:31\r\nAnd in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God\r\nbare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,\r\nuntil ye came into this place.\r\n\r\n1:32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Who\r\nwent in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your\r\ntents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and\r\nin a cloud by day.\r\n\r\n1:34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and\r\nsware, saying, 1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this\r\nevil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will\r\nI give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,\r\nbecause he hath wholly followed the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also\r\nshalt not go in thither.\r\n\r\n1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall\r\ngo in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\r\n\r\n1:39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and\r\nyour children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and\r\nevil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they\r\nshall possess it.\r\n\r\n1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the\r\nwilderness by the way of the Red sea.\r\n\r\n1:41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the\r\nLORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God\r\ncommanded us.\r\n\r\nAnd when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready\r\nto go up into the hill.\r\n\r\n1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither\r\nfight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.\r\n\r\n1:43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against\r\nthe commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.\r\n\r\n1:44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against\r\nyou, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto\r\nHormah.\r\n\r\n1:45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not\r\nhearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.\r\n\r\n1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye\r\nabode there.\r\n\r\n2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the\r\nway of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount\r\nSeir many days.\r\n\r\n2:2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed this\r\nmountain long enough: turn you northward.\r\n\r\n2:4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the\r\ncoast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and\r\nthey shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves\r\ntherefore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their\r\nland, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount\r\nSeir unto Esau for a possession.\r\n\r\n2:6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall\r\nalso buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.\r\n\r\n2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy\r\nhand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these\r\nforty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n2:8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,\r\nwhich dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from\r\nEziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.\r\n\r\n2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither\r\ncontend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land\r\nfor a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for\r\na possession.\r\n\r\n2:10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,\r\nand tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, as\r\nthe Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.\r\n\r\n2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of\r\nEsau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,\r\nand dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his\r\npossession, which the LORD gave unto them.\r\n\r\n2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we\r\nwent over the brook Zered.\r\n\r\n2:14 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were\r\ncome over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the\r\ngeneration of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as\r\nthe LORD sware unto them.\r\n\r\n2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them\r\nfrom among the host, until they were consumed.\r\n\r\n2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and\r\ndead from among the people, 2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,\r\n2:18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:\r\n2:19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,\r\ndistress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of\r\nthe land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given\r\nit unto the children of Lot for a possession.\r\n\r\n2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein\r\nin old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 2:21 A people\r\ngreat, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them\r\nbefore them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 2:22\r\nAs he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he\r\ndestroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and\r\ndwelt in their stead even unto this day: 2:23 And the Avims which\r\ndwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth\r\nout of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)  2:24 Rise\r\nye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I\r\nhave given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his\r\nland: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.\r\n\r\n2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of\r\nthee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear\r\nreport of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.\r\n\r\n2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto\r\nSihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 2:27 Let me pass\r\nthrough thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn\r\nunto the right hand nor to the left.\r\n\r\n2:28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me\r\nwater for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my\r\nfeet; 2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the\r\nMoabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over\r\nJordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.\r\n\r\n2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the\r\nLORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that\r\nhe might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.\r\n\r\n2:31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and\r\nhis land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his\r\nland.\r\n\r\n2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight\r\nat Jahaz.\r\n\r\n2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,\r\nand his sons, and all his people.\r\n\r\n2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed\r\nthe men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left\r\nnone to remain: 2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto\r\nourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.\r\n\r\n2:36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from\r\nthe city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one\r\ncity too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 2:37\r\nOnly unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto\r\nany place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains,\r\nnor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.\r\n\r\n3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of\r\nBashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\r\n\r\n3:2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,\r\nand all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do\r\nunto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at\r\nHeshbon.\r\n\r\n3:3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of\r\nBashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to\r\nhim remaining.\r\n\r\n3:4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city\r\nwhich we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of\r\nArgob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.\r\n\r\n3:5 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;\r\nbeside unwalled towns a great many.\r\n\r\n3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of\r\nHeshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a\r\nprey to ourselves.\r\n\r\n3:8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the\r\nAmorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of\r\nArnon unto mount Hermon; 3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;\r\nand the Amorites call it Shenir;) 3:10 All the cities of the plain,\r\nand all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the\r\nkingdom of Og in Bashan.\r\n\r\n3:11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;\r\nbehold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of\r\nthe children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four\r\ncubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.\r\n\r\n3:12 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which\r\nis by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,\r\ngave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.\r\n\r\n3:13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,\r\ngave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with\r\nall Bashan, which was called the land of giants.\r\n\r\n3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the\r\ncoasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,\r\nBashanhavothjair, unto this day.\r\n\r\n3:15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.\r\n\r\n3:16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead\r\neven unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto\r\nthe river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 3:17\r\nThe plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth\r\neven unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah\r\neastward.\r\n\r\n3:18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath\r\ngiven you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before\r\nyour brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.\r\n\r\n3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I\r\nknow that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I\r\nhave given you; 3:20 Until the LORD have given rest unto your\r\nbrethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land\r\nwhich the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall\r\nye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.\r\n\r\n3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen\r\nall that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall\r\nthe LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.\r\n\r\n3:22 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n3:23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 3:24 O Lord GOD,\r\nthou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty\r\nhand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do\r\naccording to thy works, and according to thy might?  3:25 I pray thee,\r\nlet me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that\r\ngoodly mountain, and Lebanon.\r\n\r\n3:26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear\r\nme: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto\r\nme of this matter.\r\n\r\n3:27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes\r\nwestward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it\r\nwith thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\r\n\r\n3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he\r\nshall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit\r\nthe land which thou shalt see.\r\n\r\n3:29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.\r\n\r\n4:1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the\r\njudgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go\r\nin and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.\r\n\r\n4:2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall\r\nye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the\r\nLORD your God which I command you.\r\n\r\n4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all\r\nthe men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them\r\nfrom among you.\r\n\r\n4:4 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one\r\nof you this day.\r\n\r\n4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD\r\nmy God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\n4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your\r\nunderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these\r\nstatutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and\r\nunderstanding people.\r\n\r\n4:7 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,\r\nas the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?  4:8\r\nAnd what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so\r\nrighteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?  4:9 Only\r\ntake heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget\r\nthe things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy\r\nheart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsons; 4:10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy\r\nGod in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people\r\ntogether, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to\r\nfear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that\r\nthey may teach their children.\r\n\r\n4:11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain\r\nburned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and\r\nthick darkness.\r\n\r\n4:12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye\r\nheard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to\r\nperform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and\r\njudgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\n4:15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner\r\nof similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of\r\nthe midst of the fire: 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a\r\ngraven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or\r\nfemale, 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the\r\nlikeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 4:18 The likeness\r\nof any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish\r\nthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 4:19 And lest thou lift up\r\nthine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and\r\nthe stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship\r\nthem, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all\r\nnations under the whole heaven.\r\n\r\n4:20 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the\r\niron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of\r\ninheritance, as ye are this day.\r\n\r\n4:21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware\r\nthat I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto\r\nthat good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:\r\n4:22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye\r\nshall go over, and possess that good land.\r\n\r\n4:23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the\r\nLORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or\r\nthe likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.\r\n\r\n4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.\r\n\r\n4:25 When thou shalt beget children, and children\xe2\x80\x99s children, and ye\r\nshall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,\r\nand make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do\r\nevil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 4:26 I\r\ncall heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall\r\nsoon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to\r\npossess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\n4:27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be\r\nleft few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.\r\n\r\n4:28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men\xe2\x80\x99s hands, wood and\r\nstone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\r\n\r\n4:29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt\r\nfind him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\r\n\r\n4:30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon\r\nthee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and\r\nshalt be obedient unto his voice; 4:31 (For the LORD thy God is a\r\nmerciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor\r\nforget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.\r\n\r\n4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,\r\nsince the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the\r\none side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such\r\nthing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  4:33 Did\r\never people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the\r\nfire, as thou hast heard, and live?  4:34 Or hath God assayed to go\r\nand take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by\r\ntemptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty\r\nhand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to\r\nall that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?\r\n4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he\r\nis God; there is none else beside him.\r\n\r\n4:36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might\r\ninstruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou\r\nheardest his words out of the midst of the fire.\r\n\r\n4:37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed\r\nafter them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power\r\nout of Egypt; 4:38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and\r\nmightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for\r\nan inheritance, as it is this day.\r\n\r\n4:39 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the\r\nLORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is\r\nnone else.\r\n\r\n4:40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,\r\nwhich I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with\r\nthy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon\r\nthe earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.\r\n\r\n4:41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the\r\nsunrising; 4:42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill\r\nhis neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that\r\nfleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 4:43 Namely, Bezer in\r\nthe wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in\r\nGilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.\r\n\r\n4:44 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of\r\nIsrael: 4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the\r\njudgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they\r\ncame forth out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n4:46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the\r\nland of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses\r\nand the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of\r\nEgypt: 4:47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of\r\nBashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan\r\ntoward the sunrising; 4:48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the\r\nriver Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 4:49 And all the\r\nplain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain,\r\nunder the springs of Pisgah.\r\n\r\n5:1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,\r\nthe statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that\r\nye may learn them, and keep, and do them.\r\n\r\n5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.\r\n\r\n5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,\r\neven us, who are all of us here alive this day.\r\n\r\n5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the\r\nmidst of the fire, 5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,\r\nto shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the\r\nfire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 5:6 I am the LORD thy\r\nGod, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\n5:7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.\r\n\r\n5:8 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any\r\nthing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or\r\nthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 5:9 Thou shalt not bow down\r\nthyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous\r\nGod, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the\r\nthird and fourth generation of them that hate me, 5:10 And shewing\r\nmercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.\r\n\r\n5:11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the\r\nLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\r\n\r\n5:12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath\r\ncommanded thee.\r\n\r\n5:13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But the\r\nseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not\r\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant,\r\nnor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy\r\ncattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant\r\nand thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.\r\n\r\n5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and\r\nthat the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand\r\nand by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee\r\nto keep the sabbath day.\r\n\r\n5:16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath\r\ncommanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go\r\nwell with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\r\n\r\n5:17 Thou shalt not kill.\r\n\r\n5:18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.\r\n\r\n5:19 Neither shalt thou steal.\r\n\r\n5:20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.\r\n\r\n5:21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife, neither shalt\r\nthou covet thy neighbours house, his field, or his manservant, or his\r\nmaidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbours.\r\n\r\n5:22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount\r\nout of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness,\r\nwith a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two\r\ntables of stone, and delivered them unto me.\r\n\r\n5:23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of\r\nthe darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near\r\nunto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 5:24 And\r\nye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his\r\ngreatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:\r\nwe have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.\r\n\r\n5:25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume\r\nus: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the\r\nliving God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and\r\nlived?  5:27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall\r\nsay: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto\r\nthee; and we will hear it, and do it.\r\n\r\n5:28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto\r\nme; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of\r\nthis people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all\r\nthat they have spoken.\r\n\r\n5:29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,\r\nand keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,\r\nand with their children for ever!  5:30 Go say to them, Get you into\r\nyour tents again.\r\n\r\n5:31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto\r\nthee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which\r\nthou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give\r\nthem to possess it.\r\n\r\n5:32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath\r\ncommanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n5:33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath\r\ncommanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and\r\nthat ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.\r\n\r\n6:1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,\r\nwhich the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them\r\nin the land whither ye go to possess it: 6:2 That thou mightest fear\r\nthe LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which\r\nI command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son\xe2\x80\x99s son, all the days of\r\nthy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.\r\n\r\n6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be\r\nwell with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of\r\nthy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\n6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 6:5 And thou shalt\r\nlove the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and\r\nwith all thy might.\r\n\r\n6:6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine\r\nheart: 6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and\r\nshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou\r\nwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\r\n\r\n6:8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they\r\nshall be as frontlets between thine eyes.\r\n\r\n6:9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy\r\ngates.\r\n\r\n6:10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee\r\ninto the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,\r\nand to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou\r\nbuildedst not, 6:11 And houses full of all good things, which thou\r\nfilledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and\r\nolive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and\r\nbe full; 6:12 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought\r\nthee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\r\n\r\n6:13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear\r\nby his name.\r\n\r\n6:14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which\r\nare round about you; 6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among\r\nyou) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and\r\ndestroy thee from off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n6:16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in\r\nMassah.\r\n\r\n6:17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,\r\nand his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.\r\n\r\n6:18 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of\r\nthe LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in\r\nand possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.\r\n\r\n6:19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n6:20 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean\r\nthe testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD\r\nour God hath commanded you?  6:21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We\r\nwere Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt\r\nwith a mighty hand: 6:22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great\r\nand sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before\r\nour eyes: 6:23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring\r\nus in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.\r\n\r\n6:24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the\r\nLORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as\r\nit is at this day.\r\n\r\n6:25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these\r\ncommandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.\r\n\r\n7:1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou\r\ngoest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the\r\nHittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,\r\nand the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations\r\ngreater and mightier than thou; 7:2 And when the LORD thy God shall\r\ndeliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy\r\nthem; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:\r\n7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou\r\nshalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy\r\nson.\r\n\r\n7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may\r\nserve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against\r\nyou, and destroy thee suddenly.\r\n\r\n7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,\r\nand break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their\r\ngraven images with fire.\r\n\r\n7:6 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy\r\nGod hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all\r\npeople that are upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n7:7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye\r\nwere more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all\r\npeople: 7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep\r\nthe oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought\r\nyou out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of\r\nbondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\r\n\r\n7:9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,\r\nwhich keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his\r\ncommandments to a thousand generations; 7:10 And repayeth them that\r\nhate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him\r\nthat hateth him, he will repay him to his face.\r\n\r\n7:11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and\r\nthe judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.\r\n\r\n7:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these\r\njudgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep\r\nunto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:\r\n7:13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will\r\nalso bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,\r\nand thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks\r\nof thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n7:14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male\r\nor female barren among you, or among your cattle.\r\n\r\n7:15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put\r\nnone of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but\r\nwill lay them upon all them that hate thee.\r\n\r\n7:16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God\r\nshall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither\r\nshalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.\r\n\r\n7:17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;\r\nhow can I dispossess them?  7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but\r\nshalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto\r\nall Egypt; 7:19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the\r\nsigns, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out\r\narm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy\r\nGod do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.\r\n\r\n7:20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until\r\nthey that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.\r\n\r\n7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is\r\namong you, a mighty God and terrible.\r\n\r\n7:22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by\r\nlittle and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the\r\nbeasts of the field increase upon thee.\r\n\r\n7:23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall\r\ndestroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.\r\n\r\n7:24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt\r\ndestroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to\r\nstand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.\r\n\r\n7:25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou\r\nshalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto\r\nthee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD\r\nthy God.\r\n\r\n7:26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest\r\nthou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and\r\nthou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.\r\n\r\n8:1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye\r\nobserve to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess\r\nthe land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.\r\n\r\n8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led\r\nthee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove\r\nthee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his\r\ncommandments, or no.\r\n\r\n8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee\r\nwith manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that\r\nhe might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by\r\nevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.\r\n\r\n8:4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,\r\nthese forty years.\r\n\r\n8:5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth\r\nhis son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.\r\n\r\n8:6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to\r\nwalk in his ways, and to fear him.\r\n\r\n8:7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of\r\nbrooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys\r\nand hills; 8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,\r\nand pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 8:9 A land wherein\r\nthou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing\r\nin it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou\r\nmayest dig brass.\r\n\r\n8:10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD\r\nthy God for the good land which he hath given thee.\r\n\r\n8:11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his\r\ncommandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command\r\nthee this day: 8:12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast\r\nbuilt goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 8:13 And when thy herds and\r\nthy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and\r\nall that thou hast is multiplied; 8:14 Then thine heart be lifted up,\r\nand thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the\r\nland of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 8:15 Who led thee through\r\nthat great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and\r\nscorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee\r\nforth water out of the rock of flint; 8:16 Who fed thee in the\r\nwilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might\r\nhumble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy\r\nlatter end; 8:17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might\r\nof mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.\r\n\r\n8:18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that\r\ngiveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant\r\nwhich he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.\r\n\r\n8:19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and\r\nwalk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify\r\nagainst you this day that ye shall surely perish.\r\n\r\n8:20 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so\r\nshall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of\r\nthe LORD your God.\r\n\r\n9:1 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to\r\npossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and\r\nfenced up to heaven, 9:2 A people great and tall, the children of the\r\nAnakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can\r\nstand before the children of Anak!  9:3 Understand therefore this day,\r\nthat the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a\r\nconsuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down\r\nbefore thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them\r\nquickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.\r\n\r\n9:4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath\r\ncast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD\r\nhath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of\r\nthese nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.\r\n\r\n9:5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,\r\ndost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these\r\nnations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and\r\nthat he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,\r\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\r\n\r\n9:6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this\r\ngood land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a\r\nstiffnecked people.\r\n\r\n9:7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to\r\nwrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of\r\nthe land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been\r\nrebellious against the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was\r\nangry with you to have destroyed you.\r\n\r\n9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,\r\neven the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I\r\nabode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat\r\nbread nor drink water: 9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables\r\nof stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written\r\naccording to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount\r\nout of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.\r\n\r\n9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,\r\nthat the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the\r\ncovenant.\r\n\r\n9:12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from\r\nhence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have\r\ncorrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way\r\nwhich I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.\r\n\r\n9:13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this\r\npeople, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 9:14 Let me alone,\r\nthat I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:\r\nand I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.\r\n\r\n9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned\r\nwith fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.\r\n\r\n9:16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your\r\nGod, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out\r\nof the way which the LORD had commanded you.\r\n\r\n9:17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and\r\nbrake them before your eyes.\r\n\r\n9:18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and\r\nforty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all\r\nyour sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,\r\nto provoke him to anger.\r\n\r\n9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the\r\nLORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto\r\nme at that time also.\r\n\r\n9:20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and\r\nI prayed for Aaron also the same time.\r\n\r\n9:21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it\r\nwith fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was\r\nas small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that\r\ndescended out of the mount.\r\n\r\n9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye\r\nprovoked the LORD to wrath.\r\n\r\n9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up\r\nand possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against\r\nthe commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor\r\nhearkened to his voice.\r\n\r\n9:24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n9:25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as\r\nI fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n9:26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy\r\nnot thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through\r\nthy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a\r\nmighty hand.\r\n\r\n9:27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto\r\nthe stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their\r\nsin: 9:28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the\r\nLORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,\r\nand because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\n9:29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou\r\nbroughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.\r\n\r\n10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone\r\nlike unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee\r\nan ark of wood.\r\n\r\n10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first\r\ntables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.\r\n\r\n10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone\r\nlike unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables\r\nin mine hand.\r\n\r\n10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the\r\nten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of\r\nthe midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave\r\nthem unto me.\r\n\r\n10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the\r\ntables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD\r\ncommanded me.\r\n\r\n10:6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the\r\nchildren of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was\r\nburied; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to\r\nJotbath, a land of rivers of waters.\r\n\r\n10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the\r\nark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister\r\nunto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.\r\n\r\n10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;\r\nthe LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n10:10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty\r\ndays and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time\r\nalso, and the LORD would not destroy thee.\r\n\r\n10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the\r\npeople, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto\r\ntheir fathers to give unto them.\r\n\r\n10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but\r\nto fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,\r\nand to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy\r\nsoul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,\r\nwhich I command thee this day for thy good?  10:14 Behold, the heaven\r\nand the heaven of heavens is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s thy God, the earth also, with\r\nall that therein is.\r\n\r\n10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he\r\nchose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more\r\nstiffnecked.\r\n\r\n10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great\r\nGod, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh\r\nreward: 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and\r\nwidow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.\r\n\r\n10:19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the\r\nland of Egypt.\r\n\r\n10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to\r\nhim shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.\r\n\r\n10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee\r\nthese great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.\r\n\r\n10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten\r\npersons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of\r\nheaven for multitude.\r\n\r\n11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,\r\nand his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.\r\n\r\n11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which\r\nhave not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD\r\nyour God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,\r\n11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of\r\nEgypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 11:4 And\r\nwhat he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their\r\nchariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as\r\nthey pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this\r\nday; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came\r\ninto this place; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons\r\nof Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and\r\nswallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the\r\nsubstance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:\r\n11:7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n11:8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you\r\nthis day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,\r\nwhither ye go to possess it; 11:9 And that ye may prolong your days in\r\nthe land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and\r\nto their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.\r\n\r\n11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the\r\nland of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,\r\nand wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11:11 But the\r\nland, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and\r\ndrinketh water of the rain of heaven: 11:12 A land which the LORD thy\r\nGod careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from\r\nthe beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.\r\n\r\n11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto\r\nmy commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your\r\nGod, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,\r\n11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,\r\nthe first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy\r\ncorn, and thy wine, and thine oil.\r\n\r\n11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou\r\nmayest eat and be full.\r\n\r\n11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye\r\nturn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 11:17 And then the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that\r\nthere be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye\r\nperish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.\r\n\r\n11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in\r\nyour soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be\r\nas frontlets between your eyes.\r\n\r\n11:19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when\r\nthou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when\r\nthou liest down, and when thou risest up.\r\n\r\n11:20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,\r\nand upon thy gates: 11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and the\r\ndays of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your\r\nfathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.\r\n\r\n11:22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I\r\ncommand you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his\r\nways, and to cleave unto him; 11:23 Then will the LORD drive out all\r\nthese nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations\r\nand mightier than yourselves.\r\n\r\n11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be\r\nyours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river\r\nEuphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.\r\n\r\n11:25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD\r\nyour God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the\r\nland that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.\r\n\r\n11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27\r\nA blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I\r\ncommand you this day: 11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the\r\ncommandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which\r\nI command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought\r\nthee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou\r\nshalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount\r\nEbal.\r\n\r\n11:30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun\r\ngoeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the\r\nchampaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?  11:31 For\r\nye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD\r\nyour God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.\r\n\r\n11:32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which\r\nI set before you this day.\r\n\r\n12:1 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to\r\ndo in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to\r\npossess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.\r\n\r\n12:2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations\r\nwhich ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and\r\nupon the hills, and under every green tree: 12:3 And ye shall\r\noverthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves\r\nwith fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and\r\ndestroy the names of them out of that place.\r\n\r\n12:4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n12:5 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of\r\nall your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall\r\nye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 12:6 And thither ye shall bring\r\nyour burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave\r\nofferings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,\r\nand the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 12:7 And there ye\r\nshall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that\r\nye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy\r\nGod hath blessed thee.\r\n\r\n12:8 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,\r\nevery man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.\r\n\r\n12:9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,\r\nwhich the LORD your God giveth you.\r\n\r\n12:10 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD\r\nyour God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all\r\nyour enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 12:11 Then there\r\nshall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his\r\nname to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;\r\nyour burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave\r\noffering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the\r\nLORD: 12:12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and\r\nyour sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your\r\nmaidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as\r\nhe hath no part nor inheritance with you.\r\n\r\n12:13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in\r\nevery place that thou seest: 12:14 But in the place which the LORD\r\nshall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt\r\nofferings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.\r\n\r\n12:15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,\r\nwhatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the\r\nLORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may\r\neat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.\r\n\r\n12:16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth\r\nas water.\r\n\r\n12:17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or\r\nof thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy\r\nflock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill\r\nofferings, or heave offering of thine hand: 12:18 But thou must eat\r\nthem before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall\r\nchoose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and\r\nthy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou\r\nshalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine\r\nhands unto.\r\n\r\n12:19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as\r\nthou livest upon the earth.\r\n\r\n12:20 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath\r\npromised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul\r\nlongeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul\r\nlusteth after.\r\n\r\n12:21 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name\r\nthere be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of\r\nthy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee,\r\nand thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.\r\n\r\n12:22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat\r\nthem: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.\r\n\r\n12:23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the\r\nlife; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.\r\n\r\n12:24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n12:25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with\r\nthy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the\r\nsight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt\r\ntake, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 12:27 And\r\nthou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon\r\nthe altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall\r\nbe poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat\r\nthe flesh.\r\n\r\n12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it\r\nmay go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when\r\nthou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n12:29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before\r\nthee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them,\r\nand dwellest in their land; 12:30 Take heed to thyself that thou be\r\nnot snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before\r\nthee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did\r\nthese nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.\r\n\r\n12:31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every\r\nabomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their\r\ngods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the\r\nfire to their gods.\r\n\r\n12:32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt\r\nnot add thereto, nor diminish from it.\r\n\r\n13:1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and\r\ngiveth thee a sign or a wonder, 13:2 And the sign or the wonder come\r\nto pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other\r\ngods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 13:3 Thou\r\nshalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of\r\ndreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the\r\nLORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\r\n\r\n13:4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his\r\ncommandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\n13:5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to\r\ndeath; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God,\r\nwhich brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of\r\nthe house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy\r\nGod commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from\r\nthe midst of thee.\r\n\r\n13:6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy\r\ndaughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine\r\nown soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other\r\ngods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 13:7 Namely,\r\nof the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee,\r\nor far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the\r\nother end of the earth; 13:8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor\r\nhearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou\r\nspare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 13:9 But thou shalt surely kill\r\nhim; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and\r\nafterwards the hand of all the people.\r\n\r\n13:10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he\r\nhath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought\r\nthee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\r\n\r\n13:11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any\r\nsuch wickedness as this is among you.\r\n\r\n13:12 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy\r\nGod hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 13:13 Certain men, the\r\nchildren of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn\r\nthe inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,\r\nwhich ye have not known; 13:14 Then shalt thou enquire, and make\r\nsearch, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing\r\ncertain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 13:15 Thou shalt\r\nsurely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,\r\ndestroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle\r\nthereof, with the edge of the sword.\r\n\r\n13:16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the\r\nstreet thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil\r\nthereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for\r\never; it shall not be built again.\r\n\r\n13:17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:\r\nthat the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee\r\nmercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath\r\nsworn unto thy fathers; 13:18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of\r\nthe LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee\r\nthis day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n14:1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut\r\nyourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.\r\n\r\n14:2 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD\r\nhath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the\r\nnations that are upon the earth.\r\n\r\n14:3 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.\r\n\r\n14:4 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and\r\nthe goat, 14:5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the\r\nwild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.\r\n\r\n14:6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft\r\ninto two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall\r\neat.\r\n\r\n14:7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or\r\nof them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and\r\nthe coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore\r\nthey are unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n14:8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the\r\ncud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor\r\ntouch their dead carcase.\r\n\r\n14:9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have\r\nfins and scales shall ye eat: 14:10 And whatsoever hath not fins and\r\nscales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.\r\n\r\n14:11 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.\r\n\r\n14:12 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the\r\nossifrage, and the ospray, 14:13 And the glede, and the kite, and the\r\nvulture after his kind, 14:14 And every raven after his kind, 14:15\r\nAnd the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after\r\nhis kind, 14:16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 14:17\r\nAnd the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 14:18 And the\r\nstork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.\r\n\r\n14:19 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they\r\nshall not be eaten.\r\n\r\n14:20 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.\r\n\r\n14:21 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt\r\ngive it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or\r\nthou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto\r\nthe LORD thy God.\r\n\r\nThou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk.\r\n\r\n14:22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the\r\nfield bringeth forth year by year.\r\n\r\n14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which\r\nhe shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy\r\nwine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy\r\nflocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.\r\n\r\n14:24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able\r\nto carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy\r\nGod shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath\r\nblessed thee: 14:25 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up\r\nthe money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD\r\nthy God shall choose: 14:26 And thou shalt bestow that money for\r\nwhatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for\r\nwine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and\r\nthou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice,\r\nthou, and thine household, 14:27 And the Levite that is within thy\r\ngates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance\r\nwith thee.\r\n\r\n14:28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe\r\nof thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:\r\n14:29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with\r\nthee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are\r\nwithin thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the\r\nLORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou\r\ndoest.\r\n\r\n15:1 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.\r\n\r\n15:2 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that\r\nlendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact\r\nit of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s release.\r\n\r\n15:3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is\r\nthine with thy brother thine hand shall release; 15:4 Save when there\r\nshall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in\r\nthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to\r\npossess it: 15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the\r\nLORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command\r\nthee this day.\r\n\r\n15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou\r\nshalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou\r\nshalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.\r\n\r\n15:7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within\r\nany of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou\r\nshalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor\r\nbrother: 15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt\r\nsurely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.\r\n\r\n15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying,\r\nThe seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be\r\nevil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry\r\nunto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.\r\n\r\n15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved\r\nwhen thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy\r\nGod shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest\r\nthine hand unto.\r\n\r\n15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I\r\ncommand thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy\r\nbrother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\r\n\r\n15:12 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold\r\nunto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou\r\nshalt let him go free from thee.\r\n\r\n15:13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let\r\nhim go away empty: 15:14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy\r\nflock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that\r\nwherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.\r\n\r\n15:15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of\r\nEgypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee\r\nthis thing to day.\r\n\r\n15:16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from\r\nthee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with\r\nthee; 15:17 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear\r\nunto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy\r\nmaidservant thou shalt do likewise.\r\n\r\n15:18 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away\r\nfree from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee,\r\nin serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in\r\nall that thou doest.\r\n\r\n15:19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock\r\nthou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with\r\nthe firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.\r\n\r\n15:20 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the\r\nplace which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.\r\n\r\n15:21 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind,\r\nor have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n15:22 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean\r\nperson shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.\r\n\r\n15:23 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it\r\nupon the ground as water.\r\n\r\n16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD\r\nthy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth\r\nout of Egypt by night.\r\n\r\n16:2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy\r\nGod, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall\r\nchoose to place his name there.\r\n\r\n16:3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou\r\neat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou\r\ncamest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest\r\nremember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all\r\nthe days of thy life.\r\n\r\n16:4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy\r\ncoast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which\r\nthou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n16:5 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates,\r\nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee: 16:6 But at the place which the\r\nLORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt\r\nsacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the\r\nseason that thou camest forth out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n16:7 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy\r\nGod shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy\r\ntents.\r\n\r\n16:8 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day\r\nshall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n16:9 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the\r\nseven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\n16:10 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God\r\nwith a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt\r\ngive unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed\r\nthee: 16:11 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and\r\nthy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant,\r\nand the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the\r\nfatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the\r\nLORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.\r\n\r\n16:12 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and\r\nthou shalt observe and do these statutes.\r\n\r\n16:13 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after\r\nthat thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 16:14 And thou shalt\r\nrejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy\r\nmanservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the\r\nfatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.\r\n\r\n16:15 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God\r\nin the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God\r\nshall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine\r\nhands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.\r\n\r\n16:16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD\r\nthy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened\r\nbread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and\r\nthey shall not appear before the LORD empty: 16:17 Every man shall\r\ngive as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God\r\nwhich he hath given thee.\r\n\r\n16:18 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which\r\nthe LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall\r\njudge the people with just judgment.\r\n\r\n16:19 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,\r\nneither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and\r\npervert the words of the righteous.\r\n\r\n16:20 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou\r\nmayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.\r\n\r\n16:21 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the\r\naltar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.\r\n\r\n16:22 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God\r\nhateth.\r\n\r\n17:1 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or\r\nsheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an\r\nabomination unto the LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n17:2 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the\r\nLORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness\r\nin the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 17:3\r\nAnd hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the\r\nsun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not\r\ncommanded; 17:4 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and\r\nenquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,\r\nthat such abomination is wrought in Israel: 17:5 Then shalt thou bring\r\nforth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing,\r\nunto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with\r\nstones, till they die.\r\n\r\n17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that\r\nis worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he\r\nshall not be put to death.\r\n\r\n17:7 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to\r\ndeath, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put\r\nthe evil away from among you.\r\n\r\n17:8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between\r\nblood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke,\r\nbeing matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise,\r\nand get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;\r\n17:9 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the\r\njudge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew\r\nthee the sentence of judgment: 17:10 And thou shalt do according to\r\nthe sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose\r\nshall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that\r\nthey inform thee: 17:11 According to the sentence of the law which\r\nthey shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall\r\ntell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence\r\nwhich they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.\r\n\r\n17:12 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken\r\nunto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy\r\nGod, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put\r\naway the evil from Israel.\r\n\r\n17:13 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more\r\npresumptuously.\r\n\r\n17:14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth\r\nthee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I\r\nwill set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;\r\n17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy\r\nGod shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over\r\nthee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n17:16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the\r\npeople to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:\r\nforasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return\r\nno more that way.\r\n\r\n17:17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn\r\nnot away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,\r\nthat he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which\r\nis before the priests the Levites: 17:19 And it shall be with him, and\r\nhe shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to\r\nfear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these\r\nstatutes, to do them: 17:20 That his heart be not lifted up above his\r\nbrethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the\r\nright hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in\r\nhis kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.\r\n\r\n18:1 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no\r\npart nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the\r\nLORD made by fire, and his inheritance.\r\n\r\n18:2 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:\r\nthe LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.\r\n\r\n18:3 And this shall be the priest\xe2\x80\x99s due from the people, from them\r\nthat offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give\r\nunto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.\r\n\r\n18:4 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,\r\nand the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.\r\n\r\n18:5 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to\r\nstand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.\r\n\r\n18:6 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,\r\nwhere he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the\r\nplace which the LORD shall choose; 18:7 Then he shall minister in the\r\nname of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which\r\nstand there before the LORD.\r\n\r\n18:8 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of\r\nthe sale of his patrimony.\r\n\r\n18:9 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth\r\nthee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n18:10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son\r\nor his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or\r\nan observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.\r\n\r\n18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard,\r\nor a necromancer.\r\n\r\n18:12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:\r\nand because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out\r\nfrom before thee.\r\n\r\n18:13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n18:14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto\r\nobservers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy\r\nGod hath not suffered thee so to do.\r\n\r\n18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the\r\nmidst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall\r\nhearken; 18:16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy\r\nGod in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again\r\nthe voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any\r\nmore, that I die not.\r\n\r\n18:17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they\r\nhave spoken.\r\n\r\n18:18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like\r\nunto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto\r\nthem all that I shall command him.\r\n\r\n18:19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto\r\nmy words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\r\n\r\n18:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name,\r\nwhich I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the\r\nname of other gods, even that prophet shall die.\r\n\r\n18:21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which\r\nthe LORD hath not spoken?  18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name\r\nof the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the\r\nthing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it\r\npresumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.\r\n\r\n19:1 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the\r\nLORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in\r\ntheir cities, and in their houses; 19:2 Thou shalt separate three\r\ncities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God\r\ngiveth thee to possess it.\r\n\r\n19:3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,\r\nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that\r\nevery slayer may flee thither.\r\n\r\n19:4 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,\r\nthat he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he\r\nhated not in time past; 19:5 As when a man goeth into the wood with\r\nhis neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe\r\nto cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and\r\nlighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of\r\nthose cities, and live: 19:6 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the\r\nslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is\r\nlong, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he\r\nhated him not in time past.\r\n\r\n19:7 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three\r\ncities for thee.\r\n\r\n19:8 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto\r\nthy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto\r\nthy fathers; 19:9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do\r\nthem, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to\r\nwalk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee,\r\nbeside these three: 19:10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land,\r\nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be\r\nupon thee.\r\n\r\n19:11 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and\r\nrise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth\r\ninto one of these cities: 19:12 Then the elders of his city shall send\r\nand fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of\r\nblood, that he may die.\r\n\r\n19:13 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt\r\nof innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.\r\n\r\n19:14 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark, which they of\r\nold time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in\r\nthe land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.\r\n\r\n19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or\r\nfor any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two\r\nwitnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n19:16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against\r\nhim that which is wrong; 19:17 Then both the men, between whom the\r\ncontroversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and\r\nthe judges, which shall be in those days; 19:18 And the judges shall\r\nmake diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false\r\nwitness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; 19:19 Then\r\nshall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother:\r\nso shalt thou put the evil away from among you.\r\n\r\n19:20 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall\r\nhenceforth commit no more any such evil among you.\r\n\r\n19:21 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye\r\nfor eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\r\n\r\n20:1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest\r\nhorses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of\r\nthem: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of\r\nthe land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n20:2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the\r\npriest shall approach and speak unto the people, 20:3 And shall say\r\nunto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against\r\nyour enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble,\r\nneither be ye terrified because of them; 20:4 For the LORD your God is\r\nhe that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n20:5 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is\r\nthere that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him\r\ngo and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man\r\ndedicate it.\r\n\r\n20:6 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet\r\neaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in\r\nthe battle, and another man eat of it.\r\n\r\n20:7 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not\r\ntaken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the\r\nbattle, and another man take her.\r\n\r\n20:8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they\r\nshall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him\r\ngo and return unto his house, lest his brethren\xe2\x80\x99s heart faint as well\r\nas his heart.\r\n\r\n20:9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking\r\nunto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n20:10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then\r\nproclaim peace unto it.\r\n\r\n20:11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto\r\nthee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein\r\nshall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.\r\n\r\n20:12 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war\r\nagainst thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 20:13 And when the LORD thy\r\nGod hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male\r\nthereof with the edge of the sword: 20:14 But the women, and the\r\nlittle ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the\r\nspoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the\r\nspoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.\r\n\r\n20:15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off\r\nfrom thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.\r\n\r\n20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth\r\ngive thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that\r\nbreatheth: 20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the\r\nHittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the\r\nHivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:\r\n20:18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,\r\nwhich they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the\r\nLORD your God.\r\n\r\n20:19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war\r\nagainst it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by\r\nforcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou\r\nshalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man\xe2\x80\x99s life) to\r\nemploy them in the siege: 20:20 Only the trees which thou knowest that\r\nthey be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and\r\nthou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,\r\nuntil it be subdued.\r\n\r\n21:1 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth\r\nthee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath\r\nslain him: 21:2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and\r\nthey shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is\r\nslain: 21:3 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the\r\nslain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which\r\nhath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 21:4\r\nAnd the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough\r\nvalley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the\r\nheifer\xe2\x80\x99s neck there in the valley: 21:5 And the priests the sons of\r\nLevi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to\r\nminister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their\r\nword shall every controversy and every stroke be tried: 21:6 And all\r\nthe elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash\r\ntheir hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 21:7 And\r\nthey shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither\r\nhave our eyes seen it.\r\n\r\n21:8 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast\r\nredeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.\r\n\r\n21:9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among\r\nyou, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD\r\nthy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them\r\ncaptive, 21:11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and\r\nhast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 21:12\r\nThen thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her\r\nhead, and pare her nails; 21:13 And she shall put the raiment of her\r\ncaptivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail\r\nher father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go\r\nin unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.\r\n\r\n21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt\r\nlet her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for\r\nmoney, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast\r\nhumbled her.\r\n\r\n21:15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and\r\nthey have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if\r\nthe firstborn son be hers that was hated: 21:16 Then it shall be, when\r\nhe maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make\r\nthe son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is\r\nindeed the firstborn: 21:17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the\r\nhated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he\r\nhath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the\r\nfirstborn is his.\r\n\r\n21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey\r\nthe voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when\r\nthey have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 21:19 Then shall\r\nhis father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the\r\nelders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 21:20 And they\r\nshall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and\r\nrebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a\r\ndrunkard.\r\n\r\n21:21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he\r\ndie: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall\r\nhear, and fear.\r\n\r\n21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to\r\nbe put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 21:23 His body shall not\r\nremain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him\r\nthat day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be\r\nnot defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.\r\n\r\n22:1 Thou shalt not see thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s ox or his sheep go astray, and\r\nhide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto\r\nthy brother.\r\n\r\n22:2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him\r\nnot, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be\r\nwith thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it\r\nto him again.\r\n\r\n22:3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do\r\nwith his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s, which he\r\nhath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest\r\nnot hide thyself.\r\n\r\n22:4 Thou shalt not see thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s ass or his ox fall down by the\r\nway, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift\r\nthem up again.\r\n\r\n22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,\r\nneither shall a man put on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s garment: for all that do so are\r\nabomination unto the LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n22:6 If a bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree,\r\nor on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam\r\nsitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam\r\nwith the young: 22:7 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and\r\ntake the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou\r\nmayest prolong thy days.\r\n\r\n22:8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement\r\nfor thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man\r\nfall from thence.\r\n\r\n22:9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit\r\nof thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be\r\ndefiled.\r\n\r\n22:10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.\r\n\r\n22:11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and\r\nlinen together.\r\n\r\n22:12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy\r\nvesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.\r\n\r\n22:13 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 22:14\r\nAnd give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name\r\nupon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found\r\nher not a maid: 22:15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her\r\nmother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s virginity unto\r\nthe elders of the city in the gate: 22:16 And the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nshall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife,\r\nand he hateth her; 22:17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech\r\nagainst her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these\r\nare the tokens of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s virginity. And they shall spread the\r\ncloth before the elders of the city.\r\n\r\n22:18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise\r\nhim; 22:19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver,\r\nand give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought\r\nup an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he\r\nmay not put her away all his days.\r\n\r\n22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not\r\nfound for the damsel: 22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to\r\nthe door of her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the men of her city shall stone\r\nher with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in\r\nIsrael, to play the whore in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house: so shalt thou put\r\nevil away from among you.\r\n\r\n22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then\r\nthey shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and\r\nthe woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.\r\n\r\n22:23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a\r\nman find her in the city, and lie with her; 22:24 Then ye shall bring\r\nthem both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with\r\nstones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the\r\ncity; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbours wife: so\r\nthou shalt put away evil from among you.\r\n\r\n22:25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man\r\nforce her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n22:26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the\r\ndamsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his\r\nneighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: 22:27 For he found\r\nher in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none\r\nto save her.\r\n\r\n22:28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed,\r\nand lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

for the locust shall consume it.\r\n\r\n28:39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither\r\ndrink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n28:40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou\r\nshalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n28:41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy\r\nthem; for they shall go into captivity.\r\n\r\n28:42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.\r\n\r\n28:43 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very\r\nhigh; and thou shalt come down very low.\r\n\r\n28:44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall\r\nbe the head, and thou shalt be the tail.\r\n\r\n28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue\r\nthee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou\r\nhearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his\r\ncommandments and his statutes which he commanded thee: 28:46 And they\r\nshall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for\r\never.\r\n\r\n28:47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and\r\nwith gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; 28:48\r\nTherefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send\r\nagainst thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want\r\nof all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he\r\nhave destroyed thee.\r\n\r\n28:49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the\r\nend of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue\r\nthou shalt not understand; 28:50 A nation of fierce countenance, which\r\nshall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:\r\n28:51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy\r\nland, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either\r\ncorn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy\r\nsheep, until he have destroyed thee.\r\n\r\n28:52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and\r\nfenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy\r\nland: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy\r\nland, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.\r\n\r\n28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy\r\nsons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in\r\nthe siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall\r\ndistress thee: 28:54 So that the man that is tender among you, and\r\nvery delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward\r\nthe wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he\r\nshall leave: 28:55 So that he will not give to any of them of the\r\nflesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left\r\nhim in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall\r\ndistress thee in all thy gates.\r\n\r\n28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not\r\nadventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness\r\nand tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom,\r\nand toward her son, and toward her daughter, 28:57 And toward her\r\nyoung one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her\r\nchildren which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all\r\nthings secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy\r\nshall distress thee in thy gates.\r\n\r\n28:58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that\r\nare written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and\r\nfearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; 28:59 Then the LORD will make thy\r\nplagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,\r\nand of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.\r\n\r\n28:60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,\r\nwhich thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.\r\n\r\n28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in\r\nthe book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\n28:62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars\r\nof heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of\r\nthe LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n28:63 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to\r\ndo you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to\r\ndestroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from\r\noff the land whither thou goest to possess it.\r\n\r\n28:64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one\r\nend of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other\r\ngods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n28:65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall\r\nthe sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a\r\ntrembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 28:66 And\r\nthy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and\r\nnight, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 28:67 In the morning\r\nthou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say,\r\nWould God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou\r\nshalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.\r\n\r\n28:68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by\r\nthe way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again:\r\nand there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and\r\nbondwomen, and no man shall buy you.\r\n\r\n29:1 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded\r\nMoses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside\r\nthe covenant which he made with them in Horeb.\r\n\r\n29:2 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have\r\nseen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto\r\nPharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 29:3 The\r\ngreat temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those\r\ngreat miracles: 29:4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to\r\nperceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.\r\n\r\n29:5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes\r\nare not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n29:6 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong\r\ndrink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n29:7 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and\r\nOg the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote\r\nthem: 29:8 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto\r\nthe Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.\r\n\r\n29:9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye\r\nmay prosper in all that ye do.\r\n\r\n29:10 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your\r\ncaptains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the\r\nmen of Israel, 29:11 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger\r\nthat is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy\r\nwater: 29:12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy\r\nGod, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this\r\nday: 29:13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto\r\nhimself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto\r\nthee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and\r\nto Jacob.\r\n\r\n29:14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;\r\n29:15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD\r\nour God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: 29:16\r\n(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came\r\nthrough the nations which ye passed by; 29:17 And ye have seen their\r\nabominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which\r\nwere among them:) 29:18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman,\r\nor family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD\r\nour God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should\r\nbe among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; 29:19 And it come\r\nto pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless\r\nhimself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the\r\nimagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: 29:20 The\r\nLORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his\r\njealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are\r\nwritten in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out\r\nhis name from under heaven.\r\n\r\n29:21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes\r\nof Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are\r\nwritten in this book of the law: 29:22 So that the generation to come\r\nof your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that\r\nshall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of\r\nthat land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 29:23\r\nAnd that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,\r\nthat it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like\r\nthe overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the\r\nLORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 29:24 Even all nations\r\nshall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what\r\nmeaneth the heat of this great anger?  29:25 Then men shall say,\r\nBecause they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their\r\nfathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the\r\nland of Egypt: 29:26 For they went and served other gods, and\r\nworshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given\r\nunto them: 29:27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this\r\nland, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:\r\n29:28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in\r\nwrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as\r\nit is this day.\r\n\r\n29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things\r\nwhich are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that\r\nwe may do all the words of this law.\r\n\r\n30:1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon\r\nthee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and\r\nthou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD\r\nthy God hath driven thee, 30:2 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God,\r\nand shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this\r\nday, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy\r\nsoul; 30:3 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and\r\nhave compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all\r\nthe nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.\r\n\r\n30:4 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,\r\nfrom thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he\r\nfetch thee: 30:5 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land\r\nwhich thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do\r\nthee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.\r\n\r\n30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart\r\nof thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with\r\nall thy soul, that thou mayest live.\r\n\r\n30:7 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine\r\nenemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.\r\n\r\n30:8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all\r\nhis commandments which I command thee this day.\r\n\r\n30:9 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of\r\nthine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle,\r\nand in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again\r\nrejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 30:10 If\r\nthou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his\r\ncommandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the\r\nlaw, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and\r\nwith all thy soul.\r\n\r\n30:11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not\r\nhidden from thee, neither is it far off.\r\n\r\n30:12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up\r\nfor us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do\r\nit?  30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who\r\nshall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear\r\nit, and do it?  30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy\r\nmouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.\r\n\r\n30:15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death\r\nand evil; 30:16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy\r\nGod, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his\r\nstatutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and\r\nthe LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\n30:17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but\r\nshalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 30:18 I\r\ndenounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye\r\nshall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over\r\nJordan to go to possess it.\r\n\r\n30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I\r\nhave set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore\r\nchoose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 30:20 That thou\r\nmayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and\r\nthat thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length\r\nof thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware\r\nunto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\r\n\r\n31:1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.\r\n\r\n31:2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this\r\nday; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto\r\nme, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\r\n\r\n31:3 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will\r\ndestroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them:\r\nand Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.\r\n\r\n31:4 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,\r\nkings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.\r\n\r\n31:5 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do\r\nunto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:\r\nfor the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not\r\nfail thee, nor forsake thee.\r\n\r\n31:7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of\r\nall Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with\r\nthis people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers\r\nto give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.\r\n\r\n31:8 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with\r\nthee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither\r\nbe dismayed.\r\n\r\n31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the\r\nsons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto\r\nall the elders of Israel.\r\n\r\n31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven\r\nyears, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of\r\ntabernacles, 31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD\r\nthy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law\r\nbefore all Israel in their hearing.\r\n\r\n31:12 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy\r\nstranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they\r\nmay learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words\r\nof this law: 31:13 And that their children, which have not known any\r\nthing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye\r\nlive in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.\r\n\r\n31:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that\r\nthou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle\r\nof the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and\r\nJoshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:\r\nand the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy\r\nfathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods\r\nof the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and\r\nwill forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.\r\n\r\n31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I\r\nwill forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall\r\nbe devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that\r\nthey will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because\r\nour God is not among us?  31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that\r\nday for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are\r\nturned unto other gods.\r\n\r\n31:19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the\r\nchildren of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a\r\nwitness for me against the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware\r\nunto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall\r\nhave eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn\r\nunto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my\r\ncovenant.\r\n\r\n31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are\r\nbefallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;\r\nfor it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I\r\nknow their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have\r\nbrought them into the land which I sware.\r\n\r\n31:22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n31:23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong\r\nand of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel\r\ninto the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.\r\n\r\n31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the\r\nwords of this law in a book, until they were finished, 31:25 That\r\nMoses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the\r\nLORD, saying, 31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side\r\nof the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there\r\nfor a witness against thee.\r\n\r\n31:27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am\r\nyet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD;\r\nand how much more after my death?  31:28 Gather unto me all the elders\r\nof your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in\r\ntheir ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.\r\n\r\n31:29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt\r\nyourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;\r\nand evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil\r\nin the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of\r\nyour hands.\r\n\r\n31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel\r\nthe words of this song, until they were ended.\r\n\r\n32:1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the\r\nwords of my mouth.\r\n\r\n32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the\r\ndew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon\r\nthe grass: 32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe\r\nye greatness unto our God.\r\n\r\n32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are\r\njudgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.\r\n\r\n32:5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his\r\nchildren: they are a perverse and crooked generation.\r\n\r\n32:6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not\r\nhe thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and\r\nestablished thee?  32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the years\r\nof many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy\r\nelders, and they will tell thee.\r\n\r\n32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when\r\nhe separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people\r\naccording to the number of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n32:9 For the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n32:10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling\r\nwilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the\r\napple of his eye.\r\n\r\n32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,\r\nspreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:\r\n32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might\r\neat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of\r\nthe rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 32:14 Butter of kine, and\r\nmilk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and\r\ngoats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure\r\nblood of the grape.\r\n\r\n32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art\r\ngrown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which\r\nmade him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.\r\n\r\n32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with\r\nabominations provoked they him to anger.\r\n\r\n32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew\r\nnot, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.\r\n\r\n32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast\r\nforgotten God that formed thee.\r\n\r\n32:19 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the\r\nprovoking of his sons, and of his daughters.\r\n\r\n32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what\r\ntheir end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children\r\nin whom is no faith.\r\n\r\n32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they\r\nhave provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to\r\njealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to\r\nanger with a foolish nation.\r\n\r\n32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\r\nlowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on\r\nfire the foundations of the mountains.\r\n\r\n32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n32:24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\r\nand with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon\r\nthem, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\r\n\r\n32:25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the\r\nyoung man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\n32:26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the\r\nremembrance of them to cease from among men: 32:27 Were it not that I\r\nfeared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave\r\nthemselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and\r\nthe LORD hath not done all this.\r\n\r\n32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any\r\nunderstanding in them.\r\n\r\n32:29 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they\r\nwould consider their latter end!  32:30 How should one chase a\r\nthousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had\r\nsold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  32:31 For their rock is not\r\nas our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.\r\n\r\n32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of\r\nGomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:\r\n32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of\r\nasps.\r\n\r\n32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my\r\ntreasures?  32:35 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot\r\nshall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and\r\nthe things that shall come upon them make haste.\r\n\r\n32:36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his\r\nservants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none\r\nshut up, or left.\r\n\r\n32:37 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they\r\ntrusted, 32:38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank\r\nthe wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and\r\nbe your protection.\r\n\r\n32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I\r\nkill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that\r\ncan deliver out of my hand.\r\n\r\n32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.\r\n\r\n32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on\r\njudgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward\r\nthem that hate me.\r\n\r\n32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall\r\ndevour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the\r\ncaptives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.\r\n\r\n32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the\r\nblood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,\r\nand will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.\r\n\r\n32:44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears\r\nof the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.\r\n\r\n32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:\r\n32:46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which\r\nI testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to\r\nobserve to do, all the words of this law.\r\n\r\n32:47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and\r\nthrough this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye\r\ngo over Jordan to possess it.\r\n\r\n32:48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 32:49\r\nGet thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in\r\nthe land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of\r\nCanaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:\r\n32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto\r\nthy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered\r\nunto his people: 32:51 Because ye trespassed against me among the\r\nchildren of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness\r\nof Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n32:52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go\r\nthither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n33:1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed\r\nthe children of Israel before his death.\r\n\r\n33:2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto\r\nthem; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands\r\nof saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.\r\n\r\n33:3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and\r\nthey sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.\r\n\r\n33:4 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the\r\ncongregation of Jacob.\r\n\r\n33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the\r\ntribes of Israel were gathered together.\r\n\r\n33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.\r\n\r\n33:7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the\r\nvoice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be\r\nsufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.\r\n\r\n33:8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy\r\nholy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst\r\nstrive at the waters of Meribah; 33:9 Who said unto his father and to\r\nhis mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his\r\nbrethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word,\r\nand kept thy covenant.\r\n\r\n33:10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they\r\nshall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine\r\naltar.\r\n\r\n33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;\r\nsmite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them\r\nthat hate him, that they rise not again.\r\n\r\n33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in\r\nsafety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he\r\nshall dwell between his shoulders.\r\n\r\n33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the\r\nprecious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth\r\nbeneath, 33:14 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,\r\nand for the precious things put forth by the moon, 33:15 And for the\r\nchief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of\r\nthe lasting hills, 33:16 And for the precious things of the earth and\r\nfulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:\r\nlet the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the\r\nhead of him that was separated from his brethren.\r\n\r\n33:17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns\r\nare like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people\r\ntogether to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of\r\nEphraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.\r\n\r\n33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,\r\nIssachar, in thy tents.\r\n\r\n33:19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall\r\noffer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the\r\nabundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.\r\n\r\n33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he\r\ndwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.\r\n\r\n33:21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a\r\nportion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of\r\nthe people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments\r\nwith Israel.\r\n\r\n33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion\xe2\x80\x99s whelp: he shall leap from\r\nBashan.\r\n\r\n33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and\r\nfull with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n33:24 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let\r\nhim be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.\r\n\r\n33:25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy\r\nstrength be.\r\n\r\n33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the\r\nheaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.\r\n\r\n33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the\r\neverlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;\r\nand shall say, Destroy them.\r\n\r\n33:28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob\r\nshall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop\r\ndown dew.\r\n\r\n33:29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved\r\nby the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy\r\nexcellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou\r\nshalt tread upon their high places.\r\n\r\n34:1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of\r\nNebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD\r\nshewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 34:2 And all Naphtali,\r\nand the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto\r\nthe utmost sea, 34:3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of\r\nJericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.\r\n\r\n34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto\r\nAbraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy\r\nseed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not\r\ngo over thither.\r\n\r\n34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,\r\naccording to the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against\r\nBethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\r\n\r\n34:7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his\r\neye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.\r\n\r\n34:8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab\r\nthirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.\r\n\r\n34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for\r\nMoses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel\r\nhearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n34:10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,\r\nwhom the LORD knew face to face, 34:11 In all the signs and the\r\nwonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to\r\nPharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 34:12 And in\r\nall that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed\r\nin the sight of all Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Joshua\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to\r\npass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses\xe2\x80\x99 minister,\r\nsaying, 1:2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over\r\nthis Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give\r\nto them, even to the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have\r\nI given unto you, as I said unto Moses.\r\n\r\n1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,\r\nthe river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great\r\nsea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.\r\n\r\n1:5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days\r\nof thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not\r\nfail thee, nor forsake thee.\r\n\r\n1:6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou\r\ndivide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers\r\nto give them.\r\n\r\n1:7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe\r\nto do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:\r\nturn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest\r\nprosper withersoever thou goest.\r\n\r\n1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou\r\nshalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do\r\naccording to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy\r\nway prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\r\n\r\n1:9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not\r\nafraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee\r\nwhithersoever thou goest.\r\n\r\n1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 1:11\r\nPass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you\r\nvictuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go\r\nin to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess\r\nit.\r\n\r\n1:12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe\r\nof Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 1:13 Remember the word which Moses\r\nthe servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath\r\ngiven you rest, and hath given you this land.\r\n\r\n1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in\r\nthe land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass\r\nbefore your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help\r\nthem; 1:15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath\r\ngiven you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your\r\nGod giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your\r\npossession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s servant gave you on\r\nthis side Jordan toward the sunrising.\r\n\r\n1:16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we\r\nwill do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.\r\n\r\n1:17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we\r\nhearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with\r\nMoses.\r\n\r\n1:18 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will\r\nnot hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall\r\nbe put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.\r\n\r\n2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy\r\nsecretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and\r\ncame into an harlot\xe2\x80\x99s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.\r\n\r\n2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came\r\nmen in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n2:3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the\r\nmen that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for\r\nthey be come to search out all the country.\r\n\r\n2:4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There\r\ncame men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 2:5 And it came to\r\npass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that\r\nthe men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them\r\nquickly; for ye shall overtake them.\r\n\r\n2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them\r\nwith the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.\r\n\r\n2:7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:\r\nand as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\n2:8 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the\r\nroof; 2:9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given\r\nyou the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the\r\ninhabitants of the land faint because of you.\r\n\r\n2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea\r\nfor you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings\r\nof the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,\r\nwhom ye utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n2:11 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,\r\nneither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you:\r\nfor the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\n2:12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I\r\nhave shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house, and give me a true token: 2:13 And that ye will save\r\nalive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and\r\nall that they have, and deliver our lives from death.\r\n\r\n2:14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not\r\nthis our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the\r\nland, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.\r\n\r\n2:15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her\r\nhouse was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.\r\n\r\n2:16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the\r\npursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the\r\npursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.\r\n\r\n2:17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine\r\noath which thou hast made us swear.\r\n\r\n2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of\r\nscarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou\r\nshalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s household, home unto thee.\r\n\r\n2:19 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy\r\nhouse into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will\r\nbe guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood\r\nshall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.\r\n\r\n2:20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of\r\nthine oath which thou hast made us to swear.\r\n\r\n2:21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent\r\nthem away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n2:22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three\r\ndays, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them\r\nthroughout all the way, but found them not.\r\n\r\n2:23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and\r\npassed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all\r\nthings that befell them: 2:24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the\r\nLORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the\r\ninhabitants of the country do faint because of us.\r\n\r\n3:1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from\r\nShittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and\r\nlodged there before they passed over.\r\n\r\n3:2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went\r\nthrough the host; 3:3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye\r\nsee the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the\r\nLevites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after\r\nit.\r\n\r\n3:4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand\r\ncubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by\r\nwhich ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.\r\n\r\n3:5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to\r\nmorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.\r\n\r\n3:6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the\r\ncovenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of\r\nthe covenant, and went before the people.\r\n\r\n3:7 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify\r\nthee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was\r\nwith Moses, so I will be with thee.\r\n\r\n3:8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the\r\ncovenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of\r\nJordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.\r\n\r\n3:9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear\r\nthe words of the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n3:10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is\r\namong you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the\r\nCanaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and\r\nthe Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.\r\n\r\n3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth\r\npasseth over before you into Jordan.\r\n\r\n3:12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,\r\nout of every tribe a man.\r\n\r\n3:13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of\r\nthe priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth,\r\nshall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be\r\ncut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall\r\nstand upon an heap.\r\n\r\n3:14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to\r\npass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant\r\nbefore the people; 3:15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto\r\nJordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in\r\nthe brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the\r\ntime of harvest,) 3:16 That the waters which came down from above\r\nstood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is\r\nbeside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,\r\neven the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed\r\nover right against Jericho.\r\n\r\n3:17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD\r\nstood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the\r\nIsraelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed\r\nclean over Jordan.\r\n\r\n4:1 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over\r\nJordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:2 Take you twelve\r\nmen out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 4:3 And command ye\r\nthem, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the\r\nplace where the priests\xe2\x80\x99 feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall\r\ncarry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where\r\nye shall lodge this night.\r\n\r\n4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the\r\nchildren of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 4:5 And Joshua said unto\r\nthem, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of\r\nJordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder,\r\naccording unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 4:6\r\nThat this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their\r\nfathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  4:7\r\nThen ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off\r\nbefore the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over\r\nJordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be\r\nfor a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.\r\n\r\n4:8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up\r\ntwelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto\r\nJoshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of\r\nIsrael, and carried them over with them unto the place where they\r\nlodged, and laid them down there.\r\n\r\n4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the\r\nplace where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant\r\nstood: and they are there unto this day.\r\n\r\n4:10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,\r\nuntil everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak\r\nunto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the\r\npeople hasted and passed over.\r\n\r\n4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,\r\nthat the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n4:12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the\r\ntribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as\r\nMoses spake unto them: 4:13 About forty thousand prepared for war\r\npassed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.\r\n\r\n4:14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;\r\nand they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.\r\n\r\n4:15 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16 Command the priests\r\nthat bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.\r\n\r\n4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of\r\nJordan.\r\n\r\n4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the\r\ncovenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the\r\nsoles of the priests\xe2\x80\x99 feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the\r\nwaters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his\r\nbanks, as they did before.\r\n\r\n4:19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the\r\nfirst month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.\r\n\r\n4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did\r\nJoshua pitch in Gilgal.\r\n\r\n4:21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your\r\nchildren shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean\r\nthese stones?  4:22 Then ye shall let your children know, saying,\r\nIsrael came over this Jordan on dry land.\r\n\r\n4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before\r\nyou, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red\r\nsea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 4:24\r\nThat all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that\r\nit is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.\r\n\r\n5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which\r\nwere on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the\r\nCanaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up\r\nthe waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were\r\npassed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them\r\nany more, because of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,\r\nand circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.\r\n\r\n5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of\r\nIsrael at the hill of the foreskins.\r\n\r\n5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people\r\nthat came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died\r\nin the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n5:5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the\r\npeople that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth\r\nout of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.\r\n\r\n5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,\r\ntill all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt,\r\nwere consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto\r\nwhom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the\r\nLORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that\r\nfloweth with milk and honey.\r\n\r\n5:7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua\r\ncircumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not\r\ncircumcised them by the way.\r\n\r\n5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the\r\npeople, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the\r\nreproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is\r\ncalled Gilgal unto this day.\r\n\r\n5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the\r\npassover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of\r\nJericho.\r\n\r\n5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after\r\nthe passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.\r\n\r\n5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the\r\nold corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any\r\nmore; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.\r\n\r\n5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted\r\nup his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against\r\nhim with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and\r\nsaid unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  5:14 And he\r\nsaid, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And\r\nJoshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto\r\nhim, What saith my Lord unto his servant?  5:15 And the captain of the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for\r\nthe place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.\r\n\r\n6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of\r\nIsrael: none went out, and none came in.\r\n\r\n6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand\r\nJericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.\r\n\r\n6:3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round\r\nabout the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.\r\n\r\n6:4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of\r\nrams\xe2\x80\x99 horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven\r\ntimes, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.\r\n\r\n6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with\r\nthe ram\xe2\x80\x99s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the\r\npeople shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall\r\nfall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,\r\nTake up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven\r\ntrumpets of rams\xe2\x80\x99 horns before the ark of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and\r\nlet him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that\r\nthe seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams\xe2\x80\x99 horns passed on\r\nbefore the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the\r\ncovenant of the LORD followed them.\r\n\r\n6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the\r\ntrumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on,\r\nand blowing with the trumpets.\r\n\r\n6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,\r\nnor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out\r\nof your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.\r\n\r\n6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:\r\nand they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.\r\n\r\n6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the\r\nark of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams\xe2\x80\x99 horns before\r\nthe ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets:\r\nand the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the\r\nark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\r\n\r\n6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned\r\ninto the camp: so they did six days.\r\n\r\n6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early\r\nabout the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same\r\nmanner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew\r\nwith the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD\r\nhath given you the city.\r\n\r\n6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are\r\ntherein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all\r\nthat are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we\r\nsent.\r\n\r\n6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest\r\nye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and\r\nmake the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.\r\n\r\n6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are\r\nconsecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:\r\nand it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,\r\nand the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down\r\nflat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight\r\nbefore him, and they took the city.\r\n\r\n6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and\r\nwoman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the\r\ncountry, Go into the harlot\xe2\x80\x99s house, and bring out thence the woman,\r\nand all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.\r\n\r\n6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,\r\nand her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she\r\nhad; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the\r\ncamp of Israel.\r\n\r\n6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only\r\nthe silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they\r\nput into the treasury of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto\r\nthis day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out\r\nJericho.\r\n\r\n6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man\r\nbefore the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he\r\nshall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest\r\nson shall he set up the gates of it.\r\n\r\n6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout\r\nall the country.\r\n\r\n7:1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed\r\nthing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of\r\nZerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the\r\nanger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,\r\non the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAnd the men went up and viewed Ai.\r\n\r\n7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the\r\npeople go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite\r\nAi; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but\r\nfew.\r\n\r\n7:4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:\r\nand they fled before the men of Ai.\r\n\r\n7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they\r\nchased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in\r\nthe going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became\r\nas water.\r\n\r\n7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face\r\nbefore the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of\r\nIsrael, and put dust upon their heads.\r\n\r\n7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all\r\nbrought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the\r\nAmorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt\r\non the other side Jordan!  7:8 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel\r\nturneth their backs before their enemies!  7:9 For the Canaanites and\r\nall the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us\r\nround, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto\r\nthy great name?  7:10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up;\r\nwherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?  7:11 Israel hath sinned, and\r\nthey have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for\r\nthey have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and\r\ndissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.\r\n\r\n7:12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their\r\nenemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they\r\nwere accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy\r\nthe accursed from among you.\r\n\r\n7:13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to\r\nmorrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed\r\nthing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before\r\nthine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.\r\n\r\n7:14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your\r\ntribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall\r\ncome according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD\r\nshall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD\r\nshall take shall come man by man.\r\n\r\n7:15 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing\r\nshall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath\r\ntransgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought\r\nfolly in Israel.\r\n\r\n7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by\r\ntheir tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 7:17 And he brought\r\nthe family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he\r\nbrought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:\r\n7:18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of\r\nCarmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to\r\nthe LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now\r\nwhat thou hast done; hide it not from me.\r\n\r\n7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against\r\nthe LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 7:21 When I saw\r\namong the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels\r\nof silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted\r\nthem, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the\r\nmidst of my tent, and the silver under it.\r\n\r\n7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,\r\nbehold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.\r\n\r\n7:23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them\r\nunto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out\r\nbefore the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,\r\nand the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,\r\nand his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his\r\ntent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of\r\nAchor.\r\n\r\n7:25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall\r\ntrouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and\r\nburned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.\r\n\r\n7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So\r\nthe LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name\r\nof that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.\r\n\r\n8:1 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:\r\ntake all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I\r\nhave given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,\r\nand his land: 8:2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst\r\nunto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle\r\nthereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush\r\nfor the city behind it.\r\n\r\n8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:\r\nand Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent\r\nthem away by night.\r\n\r\n8:4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait\r\nagainst the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city,\r\nbut be ye all ready: 8:5 And I, and all the people that are with me,\r\nwill approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come\r\nout against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 8:6\r\n(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the\r\ncity; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first:\r\ntherefore we will flee before them.\r\n\r\n8:7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:\r\nfor the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.\r\n\r\n8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set\r\nthe city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye\r\ndo. See, I have commanded you.\r\n\r\n8:9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,\r\nand abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua\r\nlodged that night among the people.\r\n\r\n8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,\r\nand went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.\r\n\r\n8:11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,\r\nwent up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the\r\nnorth side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.\r\n\r\n8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in\r\nambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.\r\n\r\n8:13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on\r\nthe north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the\r\ncity, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.\r\n\r\n8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted\r\nand rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to\r\nbattle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;\r\nbut he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before\r\nthem, and fled by the way of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n8:16 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue\r\nafter them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n8:17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out\r\nafter Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.\r\n\r\n8:18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in\r\nthy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua\r\nstretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.\r\n\r\n8:19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as\r\nsoon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city,\r\nand took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.\r\n\r\n8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,\r\nthe smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to\r\nflee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness\r\nturned back upon the pursuers.\r\n\r\n8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the\r\ncity, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,\r\nand slew the men of Ai.\r\n\r\n8:22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were\r\nin the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and\r\nthey smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.\r\n\r\n8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.\r\n\r\n8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all\r\nthe inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they\r\nchased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,\r\nuntil they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,\r\nand smote it with the edge of the sword.\r\n\r\n8:25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and\r\nwomen, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.\r\n\r\n8:26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the\r\nspear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.\r\n\r\n8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey\r\nunto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he\r\ncommanded Joshua.\r\n\r\n8:28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a\r\ndesolation unto this day.\r\n\r\n8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as\r\nsoon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his\r\ncarcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of\r\nthe city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth\r\nunto this day.\r\n\r\n8:30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount\r\nEbal, 8:31 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of\r\nIsrael, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of\r\nwhole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they\r\noffered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\n8:32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,\r\nwhich he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n8:33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,\r\nstood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the\r\nLevites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the\r\nstranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against\r\nmount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the\r\nservant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the\r\npeople of Israel.\r\n\r\n8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and\r\ncursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.\r\n\r\n8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua\r\nread not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and\r\nthe little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.\r\n\r\n9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side\r\nJordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the\r\ngreat sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the\r\nCanaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;\r\n9:2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and\r\nwith Israel, with one accord.\r\n\r\n9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto\r\nJericho and to Ai, 9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if\r\nthey had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and\r\nwine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 9:5 And old shoes and\r\nclouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread\r\nof their provision was dry and mouldy.\r\n\r\n9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto\r\nhim, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now\r\ntherefore make ye a league with us.\r\n\r\n9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell\r\namong us; and how shall we make a league with you?  9:8 And they said\r\nunto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are\r\nye? and from whence come ye?  9:9 And they said unto him, From a very\r\nfar country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy\r\nGod: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,\r\n9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were\r\nbeyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,\r\nwhich was at Ashtaroth.\r\n\r\n9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake\r\nto us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet\r\nthem, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a\r\nleague with us.\r\n\r\n9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on\r\nthe day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and\r\nit is mouldy: 9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were\r\nnew; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes\r\nare become old by reason of the very long journey.\r\n\r\n9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the\r\nmouth of the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to\r\nlet them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.\r\n\r\n9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made\r\na league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours,\r\nand that they dwelt among them.\r\n\r\n9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities\r\non the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and\r\nBeeroth, and Kirjathjearim.\r\n\r\n9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of\r\nthe congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And\r\nall the congregation murmured against the princes.\r\n\r\n9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn\r\nunto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath\r\nbe upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.\r\n\r\n9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the\r\nprinces had promised them.\r\n\r\n9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,\r\nWherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when\r\nye dwell among us?  9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall\r\nnone of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and\r\ndrawers of water for the house of my God.\r\n\r\n9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told\r\nthy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to\r\ngive you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land\r\nfrom before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of\r\nyou, and have done this thing.\r\n\r\n9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and\r\nright unto thee to do unto us, do.\r\n\r\n9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of\r\nthe children of Israel, that they slew them not.\r\n\r\n9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water\r\nfor the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this\r\nday, in the place which he should choose.\r\n\r\n10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard\r\nhow Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done\r\nto Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how\r\nthe inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among\r\nthem; 10:2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,\r\nas one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and\r\nall the men thereof were mighty.\r\n\r\n10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of\r\nHebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of\r\nLachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 10:4 Come up unto me,\r\nand help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with\r\nJoshua and with the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,\r\nthe king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king\r\nof Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all\r\ntheir hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.\r\n\r\n10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,\r\nsaying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,\r\nand save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell\r\nin the mountains are gathered together against us.\r\n\r\n10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war\r\nwith him, and all the mighty men of valour.\r\n\r\n10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have\r\ndelivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand\r\nbefore thee.\r\n\r\n10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal\r\nall night.\r\n\r\n10:10 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with\r\na great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth\r\nup to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.\r\n\r\n10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were\r\nin the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones\r\nfrom heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which\r\ndied with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\n10:12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered\r\nup the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the\r\nsight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in\r\nthe valley of Ajalon.\r\n\r\n10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people\r\nhad avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the\r\nbook of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and\r\nhasted not to go down about a whole day.\r\n\r\n10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the\r\nLORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to\r\nGilgal.\r\n\r\n10:16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at\r\nMakkedah.\r\n\r\n10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in\r\na cave at Makkedah.\r\n\r\n10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,\r\nand set men by it for to keep them: 10:19 And stay ye not, but pursue\r\nafter your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to\r\nenter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them\r\ninto your hand.\r\n\r\n10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had\r\nmade an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they\r\nwere consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into\r\nfenced cities.\r\n\r\n10:21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in\r\npeace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out\r\nthose five kings unto me out of the cave.\r\n\r\n10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out\r\nof the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of\r\nJarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.\r\n\r\n10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto\r\nJoshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto\r\nthe captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put\r\nyour feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put\r\ntheir feet upon the necks of them.\r\n\r\n10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong\r\nand of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies\r\nagainst whom ye fight.\r\n\r\n10:26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them\r\non five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.\r\n\r\n10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,\r\nthat Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast\r\nthem into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in\r\nthe cave\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, which remain until this very day.\r\n\r\n10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of\r\nthe sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all\r\nthe souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the\r\nking of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.\r\n\r\n10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto\r\nLibnah, and fought against Libnah: 10:30 And the LORD delivered it\r\nalso, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it\r\nwith the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he\r\nlet none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto\r\nthe king of Jericho.\r\n\r\n10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto\r\nLachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:32 And the\r\nLORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the\r\nsecond day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls\r\nthat were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.\r\n\r\n10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua\r\nsmote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.\r\n\r\n10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with\r\nhim; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:35 And\r\nthey took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and\r\nall the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,\r\naccording to all that he had done to Lachish.\r\n\r\n10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto\r\nHebron; and they fought against it: 10:37 And they took it, and smote\r\nit with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the\r\ncities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none\r\nremaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed\r\nit utterly, and all the souls that were therein.\r\n\r\n10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and\r\nfought against it: 10:39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all\r\nthe cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,\r\nand utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none\r\nremaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the\r\nking thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.\r\n\r\n10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,\r\nand of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none\r\nremaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of\r\nIsrael commanded.\r\n\r\n10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all\r\nthe country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.\r\n\r\n10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,\r\nbecause the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.\r\n\r\n10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to\r\nGilgal.\r\n\r\n11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those\r\nthings, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of\r\nShimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 11:2 And to the kings that were\r\non the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth,\r\nand in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 11:3 And to\r\nthe Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the\r\nHittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to\r\nthe Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.\r\n\r\n11:4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much\r\npeople, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with\r\nhorses and chariots very many.\r\n\r\n11:5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched\r\ntogether at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\r\n\r\n11:6 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for\r\nto morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before\r\nIsrael: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n11:7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them\r\nby the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.\r\n\r\n11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote\r\nthem, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and\r\nunto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they\r\nleft them none remaining.\r\n\r\n11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their\r\nhorses, and burnt their chariots with fire.\r\n\r\n11:10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote\r\nthe king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of\r\nall those kingdoms.\r\n\r\n11:11 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of\r\nthe sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe:\r\nand he burnt Hazor with fire.\r\n\r\n11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,\r\ndid Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he\r\nutterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.\r\n\r\n11:13 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel\r\nburned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.\r\n\r\n11:14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children\r\nof Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote\r\nwith the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither\r\nleft they any to breathe.\r\n\r\n11:15 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command\r\nJoshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD\r\ncommanded Moses.\r\n\r\n11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south\r\ncountry, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,\r\nand the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 11:17 Even\r\nfrom the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the\r\nvalley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and\r\nsmote them, and slew them.\r\n\r\n11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.\r\n\r\n11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of\r\nIsrael, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they\r\ntook in battle.\r\n\r\n11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should\r\ncome against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and\r\nthat they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the\r\nLORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n11:21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the\r\nmountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the\r\nmountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua\r\ndestroyed them utterly with their cities.\r\n\r\n11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children\r\nof Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.\r\n\r\n11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD\r\nsaid unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel\r\naccording to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel\r\nsmote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the\r\nrising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the\r\nplain on the east: 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in\r\nHeshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river\r\nArnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even\r\nunto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;\r\n12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto\r\nthe sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to\r\nBethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: 12:4 And the\r\ncoast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants,\r\nthat dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 12:5 And reigned in mount\r\nHermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the\r\nGeshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon\r\nking of Heshbon.\r\n\r\n12:6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel\r\nsmite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto\r\nthe Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.\r\n\r\n12:7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the\r\nchildren of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad\r\nin the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to\r\nSeir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession\r\naccording to their divisions; 12:8 In the mountains, and in the\r\nvalleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,\r\nand in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the\r\nCanaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 12:9 The\r\nking of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;\r\n12:10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 The\r\nking of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12:12 The king of\r\nEglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 12:13 The king of Debir, one; the\r\nking of Geder, one; 12:14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad,\r\none; 12:15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 12:16\r\nThe king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 12:17 The king of\r\nTappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 12:18 The king of Aphek, one;\r\nthe king of Lasharon, one; 12:19 The king of Madon, one; the king of\r\nHazor, one; 12:20 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph,\r\none; 12:21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 12:22\r\nThe king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; 12:23 The\r\nking of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of\r\nGilgal, one; 12:24 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and\r\none.\r\n\r\n13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto\r\nhim, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very\r\nmuch land to be possessed.\r\n\r\n13:2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the\r\nPhilistines, and all Geshuri, 13:3 From Sihor, which is before Egypt,\r\neven unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the\r\nCanaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the\r\nAshdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also\r\nthe Avites: 13:4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and\r\nMearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the\r\nAmorites: 13:5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward\r\nthe sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into\r\nHamath.\r\n\r\n13:6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto\r\nMisrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from\r\nbefore the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the\r\nIsraelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.\r\n\r\n13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine\r\ntribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 13:8 With whom the Reubenites\r\nand the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave\r\nthem, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD\r\ngave them; 13:9 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon,\r\nand the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of\r\nMedeba unto Dibon; 13:10 And all the cities of Sihon king of the\r\nAmorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of\r\nAmmon; 13:11 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and\r\nMaachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 13:12\r\nAll the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in\r\nEdrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses\r\nsmite, and cast them out.\r\n\r\n13:13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,\r\nnor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell\r\namong the Israelites until this day.\r\n\r\n13:14 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the\r\nsacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their\r\ninheritance, as he said unto them.\r\n\r\n13:15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben\r\ninheritance according to their families.\r\n\r\n13:16 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river\r\nArnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the\r\nplain by Medeba; 13:17 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the\r\nplain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, 13:18 And Jahaza, and\r\nKedemoth, and Mephaath, 13:19 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and\r\nZarethshahar in the mount of the valley, 13:20 And Bethpeor, and\r\nAshdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, 13:21 And all the cities of the\r\nplain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which\r\nreigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi,\r\nand Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon,\r\ndwelling in the country.\r\n\r\n13:22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of\r\nIsrael slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.\r\n\r\n13:23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the\r\nborder thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben\r\nafter their families, the cities and the villages thereof.\r\n\r\n13:24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the\r\nchildren of Gad according to their families.\r\n\r\n13:25 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and\r\nhalf the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before\r\nRabbah; 13:26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and\r\nfrom Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 13:27 And in the valley,\r\nBetharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the\r\nkingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the\r\nedge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.\r\n\r\n13:28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their\r\nfamilies, the cities, and their villages.\r\n\r\n13:29 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and\r\nthis was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh\r\nby their families.\r\n\r\n13:30 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom\r\nof Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan,\r\nthreescore cities: 13:31 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei,\r\ncities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the\r\nchildren of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the\r\nchildren of Machir by their families.\r\n\r\n13:32 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for\r\ninheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by\r\nJericho, eastward.\r\n\r\n13:33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the\r\nLORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.\r\n\r\n14:1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel\r\ninherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua\r\nthe son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the\r\nchildren of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.\r\n\r\n14:2 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand\r\nof Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.\r\n\r\n14:3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half\r\ntribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none\r\ninheritance among them.\r\n\r\n14:4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:\r\ntherefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities\r\nto dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n14:5 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and\r\nthey divided the land.\r\n\r\n14:6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb\r\nthe son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the\r\nthing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and\r\nthee in Kadeshbarnea.\r\n\r\n14:7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me\r\nfrom Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again\r\nas it was in mine heart.\r\n\r\n14:8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of\r\nthe people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.\r\n\r\n14:9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy\r\nfeet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\never, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.\r\n\r\n14:10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these\r\nforty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses,\r\nwhile the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo,\r\nI am this day fourscore and five years old.\r\n\r\n14:11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses\r\nsent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,\r\nboth to go out, and to come in.\r\n\r\n14:12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in\r\nthat day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there,\r\nand that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be\r\nwith me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.\r\n\r\n14:13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh\r\nHebron for an inheritance.\r\n\r\n14:14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of\r\nJephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed\r\nthe LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a\r\ngreat man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.\r\n\r\n15:1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by\r\ntheir families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin\r\nsouthward was the uttermost part of the south coast.\r\n\r\n15:2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from\r\nthe bay that looketh southward: 15:3 And it went out to the south side\r\nto Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the\r\nsouth side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up\r\nto Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: 15:4 From thence it passed\r\ntoward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out\r\nof that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.\r\n\r\n15:5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of\r\nJordan.\r\n\r\nAnd their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at\r\nthe uttermost part of Jordan: 15:6 And the border went up to\r\nBethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border\r\nwent up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 15:7 And the border\r\nwent up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward,\r\nlooking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which\r\nis on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the\r\nwaters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: 15:8\r\nAnd the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the\r\nsouth side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went\r\nup to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom\r\nwestward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:\r\n15:9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the\r\nfountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount\r\nEphron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:\r\n15:10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,\r\nand passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on\r\nthe north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:\r\n15:11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and\r\nthe border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and\r\nwent out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n15:12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.\r\n\r\nThis is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n15:13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the\r\nchildren of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,\r\neven the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.\r\n\r\n15:14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and\r\nAhiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.\r\n\r\n15:15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name\r\nof Debir before was Kirjathsepher.\r\n\r\n15:16 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to\r\nhim will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.\r\n\r\n15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and\r\nhe gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\r\n\r\n15:18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to\r\nask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said\r\nunto her, What wouldest thou?  15:19 Who answered, Give me a blessing;\r\nfor thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.\r\nAnd he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\r\n\r\n15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah\r\naccording to their families.\r\n\r\n15:21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah\r\ntoward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,\r\n15:22 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, 15:23 And Kedesh, and Hazor,\r\nand Ithnan, 15:24 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, 15:25 And Hazor,\r\nHadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor, 15:26 Amam, and\r\nShema, and Moladah, 15:27 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,\r\n15:28 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, 15:29 Baalah, and\r\nIim, and Azem, 15:30 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah, 15:31 And\r\nZiklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah, 15:32 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim,\r\nand Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their\r\nvillages: 15:33 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,\r\n15:34 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 15:35 Jarmuth, and\r\nAdullam, Socoh, and Azekah, 15:36 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and\r\nGederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages: 15:37\r\nZenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad, 15:38 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and\r\nJoktheel, 15:39 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, 15:40 And Cabbon, and\r\nLahmam, and Kithlish, 15:41 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and\r\nMakkedah; sixteen cities with their villages: 15:42 Libnah, and Ether,\r\nand Ashan, 15:43 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib, 15:44 And Keilah,\r\nand Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages: 15:45\r\nEkron, with her towns and her villages: 15:46 From Ekron even unto the\r\nsea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages: 15:47 Ashdod with\r\nher towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto\r\nthe river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof: 15:48\r\nAnd in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh, 15:49 And Dannah,\r\nand Kirjathsannah, which is Debir, 15:50 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and\r\nAnim, 15:51 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their\r\nvillages: 15:52 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean, 15:53 And Janum, and\r\nBethtappuah, and Aphekah, 15:54 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is\r\nHebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages: 15:55 Maon, Carmel,\r\nand Ziph, and Juttah, 15:56 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,\r\n15:57 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages: 15:58\r\nHalhul, Bethzur, and Gedor, 15:59 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and\r\nEltekon; six cities with their villages: 15:60 Kirjathbaal, which is\r\nKirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages: 15:61 In\r\nthe wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah, 15:62 And Nibshan,\r\nand the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n15:63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children\r\nof Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the\r\nchildren of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.\r\n\r\n16:1 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by\r\nJericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that\r\ngoeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, 16:2 And goeth out from\r\nBethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,\r\n16:3 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast\r\nof Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are\r\nat the sea.\r\n\r\n16:4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n16:5 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their\r\nfamilies was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east\r\nside was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 16:6 And the border\r\nwent out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the\r\nborder went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the\r\neast to Janohah; 16:7 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to\r\nNaarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.\r\n\r\n16:8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;\r\nand the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of\r\nthe tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.\r\n\r\n16:9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among\r\nthe inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\n16:10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but\r\nthe Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve\r\nunder tribute.\r\n\r\n17:1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the\r\nfirstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the\r\nfather of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead\r\nand Bashan.\r\n\r\n17:2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by\r\ntheir families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of\r\nHelek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of\r\nShechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of\r\nShemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of\r\nMachir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are\r\nthe names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and\r\nTirzah.\r\n\r\n17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua\r\nthe son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded\r\nMoses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore\r\naccording to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance\r\namong the brethren of their father.\r\n\r\n17:5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of\r\nGilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; 17:6 Because\r\nthe daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the\r\nrest of Manasseh\xe2\x80\x99s sons had the land of Gilead.\r\n\r\n17:7 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that\r\nlieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto\r\nthe inhabitants of Entappuah.\r\n\r\n17:8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border\r\nof Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 17:9 And the coast\r\ndescended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities\r\nof Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh\r\nalso was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were\r\nat the sea: 17:10 Southward it was Ephraim\xe2\x80\x99s, and northward it was\r\nManasseh\xe2\x80\x99s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher\r\non the north, and in Issachar on the east.\r\n\r\n17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her\r\ntowns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her\r\ntowns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants\r\nof Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her\r\ntowns, even three countries.\r\n\r\n17:12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants\r\nof those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\r\n\r\n17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen\r\nstrong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly\r\ndrive them out.\r\n\r\n17:14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast\r\nthou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a\r\ngreat people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  17:15\r\nAnd Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up\r\nto the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the\r\nPerizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.\r\n\r\n17:16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:\r\nand all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have\r\nchariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and\r\nthey who are of the valley of Jezreel.\r\n\r\n17:17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and\r\nto Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power:\r\nthou shalt not have one lot only: 17:18 But the mountain shall be\r\nthine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings\r\nof it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though\r\nthey have iron chariots, and though they be strong.\r\n\r\n18:1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled\r\ntogether at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation\r\nthere. And the land was subdued before them.\r\n\r\n18:2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,\r\nwhich had not yet received their inheritance.\r\n\r\n18:3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye\r\nslack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers\r\nhath given you?  18:4 Give out from among you three men for each\r\ntribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the\r\nland, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they\r\nshall come again to me.\r\n\r\n18:5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in\r\ntheir coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their\r\ncoasts on the north.\r\n\r\n18:6 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring\r\nthe description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before\r\nthe LORD our God.\r\n\r\n18:7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the\r\nLORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of\r\nManasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,\r\nwhich Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.\r\n\r\n18:8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that\r\nwent to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and\r\ndescribe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you\r\nbefore the LORD in Shiloh.\r\n\r\n18:9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by\r\ncities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the\r\nhost at Shiloh.\r\n\r\n18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and\r\nthere Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to\r\ntheir divisions.\r\n\r\n18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up\r\naccording to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth\r\nbetween the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.\r\n\r\n18:12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the\r\nborder went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up\r\nthrough the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the\r\nwilderness of Bethaven.\r\n\r\n18:13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of\r\nLuz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to\r\nAtarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether\r\nBethhoron.\r\n\r\n18:14 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the\r\nsea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward;\r\nand the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is\r\nKirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n18:15 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the\r\nborder went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of\r\nNephtoah: 18:16 And the border came down to the end of the mountain\r\nthat lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the\r\nvalley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of\r\nHinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,\r\n18:17 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and\r\nwent forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of\r\nAdummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 18:18\r\nAnd passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and\r\nwent down unto Arabah: 18:19 And the border passed along to the side\r\nof Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the\r\nnorth bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the\r\nsouth coast.\r\n\r\n18:20 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the\r\ninheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round\r\nabout, according to their families.\r\n\r\n18:21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin\r\naccording to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the\r\nvalley of Keziz, 18:22 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, 18:23\r\nAnd Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah, 18:24 And Chepharhaammonai, and\r\nOphni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: 18:25 Gibeon, and\r\nRamah, and Beeroth, 18:26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 18:27\r\nAnd Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, 18:28 And Zelah, Eleph, and\r\nJebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with\r\ntheir villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin\r\naccording to their families.\r\n\r\n19:1 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of\r\nthe children of Simeon according to their families: and their\r\ninheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.\r\n\r\n19:2 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and\r\nMoladah, 19:3 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem, 19:4 And Eltolad,\r\nand Bethul, and Hormah, 19:5 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and\r\nHazarsusah, 19:6 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and\r\ntheir villages: 19:7 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities\r\nand their villages: 19:8 And all the villages that were round about\r\nthese cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the\r\ninheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n19:9 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance\r\nof the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was\r\ntoo much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their\r\ninheritance within the inheritance of them.\r\n\r\n19:10 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according\r\nto their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:\r\n19:11 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and\r\nreached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before\r\nJokneam;

19:14 And the border compasseth it on the north side to\r\nHannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:\r\n19:15 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and\r\nBethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to\r\ntheir families, these cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:17 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of\r\nIssachar according to their families.\r\n\r\n19:18 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,\r\n19:19 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 19:20 And Rabbith, and\r\nKishion, and Abez, 19:21 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and\r\nBethpazzez; 19:22 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and\r\nBethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen\r\ncities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar\r\naccording to their families, the cities and their villages.\r\n\r\n19:24 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of\r\nAsher according to their families.\r\n\r\n19:25 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,\r\n19:26 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal;

19:29 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and\r\nto the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the\r\noutgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib: 19:30 Ummah\r\nalso, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher\r\naccording to their families, these cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:32 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the\r\nchildren of Naphtali according to their families.\r\n\r\n19:33 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and\r\nAdami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were\r\nat Jordan: 19:34 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor,\r\nand goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the\r\nsouth side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon\r\nJordan toward the sunrising.\r\n\r\n19:35 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and\r\nChinnereth, 19:36 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor, 19:37 And Kedesh,\r\nand Edrei, and Enhazor, 19:38 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and\r\nBethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali\r\naccording to their families, the cities and their villages.\r\n\r\n19:40 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of\r\nDan according to their families.\r\n\r\n19:41 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and\r\nIrshemesh, 19:42 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 19:43 And\r\nElon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 19:44 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and\r\nBaalath, 19:45 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, 19:46 And\r\nMejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.\r\n\r\n19:47 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for\r\nthem: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem,\r\nand took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed\r\nit, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan\r\ntheir father.\r\n\r\n19:48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan\r\naccording to their families, these cities with their villages.\r\n\r\n19:49 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance\r\nby their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua\r\nthe son of Nun among them: 19:50 According to the word of the LORD\r\nthey gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount\r\nEphraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.\r\n\r\n19:51 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua\r\nthe son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the\r\nchildren of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before\r\nthe LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they\r\nmade an end of dividing the country.\r\n\r\n20:1 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 20:2 Speak to the\r\nchildren of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge,\r\nwhereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 20:3 That the slayer\r\nthat killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and\r\nthey shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.\r\n\r\n20:4 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand\r\nat the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause\r\nin the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the\r\ncity unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.\r\n\r\n20:5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not\r\ndeliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour\r\nunwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.\r\n\r\n20:6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the\r\ncongregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that\r\nshall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto\r\nhis own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n20:7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and\r\nShechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the\r\nmountain of Judah.\r\n\r\n20:8 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned\r\nBezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and\r\nRamoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of\r\nthe tribe of Manasseh.\r\n\r\n20:9 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel,\r\nand for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever\r\nkilleth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the\r\nhand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.\r\n\r\n21:1 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto\r\nEleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads\r\nof the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 21:2 And they\r\nspake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD\r\ncommanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the\r\nsuburbs thereof for our cattle.\r\n\r\n21:3 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their\r\ninheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their\r\nsuburbs.\r\n\r\n21:4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the\r\nchildren of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot\r\nout of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of\r\nthe tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.\r\n\r\n21:5 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the\r\nfamilies of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out\r\nof the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.\r\n\r\n21:6 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the\r\ntribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe\r\nof Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n21:7 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of\r\nReuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun,\r\ntwelve cities.\r\n\r\n21:8 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these\r\ncities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n21:9 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out\r\nof the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here\r\nmentioned by name.\r\n\r\n21:10 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the\r\nKohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the\r\nfirst lot.\r\n\r\n21:11 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which\r\ncity is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof\r\nround about it.\r\n\r\n21:12 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they\r\nto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.\r\n\r\n21:13 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with\r\nher suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with\r\nher suburbs, 21:14 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her\r\nsuburbs, 21:15 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,\r\n21:16 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and\r\nBethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.\r\n\r\n21:17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba\r\nwith her suburbs, 21:18 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her\r\nsuburbs; four cities.\r\n\r\n21:19 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were\r\nthirteen cities with their suburbs.\r\n\r\n21:20 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which\r\nremained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their\r\nlot out of the tribe of Ephraim.\r\n\r\n21:21 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to\r\nbe a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 21:22\r\nAnd Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n21:23 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon\r\nwith her suburbs, 21:24 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her\r\nsuburbs; four cities.\r\n\r\n21:25 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs,\r\nand Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.\r\n\r\n21:26 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of\r\nthe children of Kohath that remained.\r\n\r\n21:27 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the\r\nLevites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in\r\nBashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and\r\nBeeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.\r\n\r\n21:28 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,\r\nDabareh with her suburbs, 21:29 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim\r\nwith her suburbs; four cities.\r\n\r\n21:30 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon\r\nwith her suburbs, 21:31 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her\r\nsuburbs; four cities.\r\n\r\n21:32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her\r\nsuburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with\r\nher suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.\r\n\r\n21:33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families\r\nwere thirteen cities with their suburbs.\r\n\r\n21:34 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the\r\nLevites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and\r\nKartah with her suburbs, 21:35 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with\r\nher suburbs; four cities.\r\n\r\n21:36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and\r\nJahazah with her suburbs, 21:37 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and\r\nMephaath with her suburbs; four cities.\r\n\r\n21:38 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs,\r\nto be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,\r\n21:39 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in\r\nall.\r\n\r\n21:40 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,\r\nwhich were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot\r\ntwelve cities.\r\n\r\n21:41 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the\r\nchildren of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.\r\n\r\n21:42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:\r\nthus were all these cities.\r\n\r\n21:43 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to\r\ngive unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.\r\n\r\n21:44 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that\r\nhe sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their\r\nenemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n21:45 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had\r\nspoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.\r\n\r\n22:1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half\r\ntribe of Manasseh, 22:2 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that\r\nMoses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice\r\nin all that I commanded you: 22:3 Ye have not left your brethren these\r\nmany days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment\r\nof the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n22:4 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as\r\nhe promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your\r\ntents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant\r\nof the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.\r\n\r\n22:5 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which\r\nMoses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God,\r\nand to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to\r\ncleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all\r\nyour soul.\r\n\r\n22:6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto\r\ntheir tents.\r\n\r\n22:7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given\r\npossession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua\r\namong their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua\r\nsent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, 22:8 And\r\nhe spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents,\r\nand with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass,\r\nand with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your\r\nenemies with your brethren.\r\n\r\n22:9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half\r\ntribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel\r\nout of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country\r\nof Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were\r\npossessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n22:10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the\r\nland of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the\r\nhalf tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar\r\nto see to.\r\n\r\n22:11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of\r\nReuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have\r\nbuilt an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of\r\nJordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:12 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole\r\ncongregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at\r\nShiloh, to go up to war against them.\r\n\r\n22:13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and\r\nto the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the\r\nland of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 22:14 And with\r\nhim ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the\r\ntribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their\r\nfathers among the thousands of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:15 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children\r\nof Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,\r\nand they spake with them, saying, 22:16 Thus saith the whole\r\ncongregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed\r\nagainst the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the\r\nLORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this\r\nday against the LORD?  22:17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for\r\nus, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was\r\na plague in the congregation of the LORD, 22:18 But that ye must turn\r\naway this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel\r\nto day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the\r\nwhole congregation of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:19 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then\r\npass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel\r\nnot against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar\r\nbeside the altar of the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n22:20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed\r\nthing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man\r\nperished not alone in his iniquity.\r\n\r\n22:21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half\r\ntribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands\r\nof Israel, 22:22 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he\r\nknoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in\r\ntransgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 22:23 That we\r\nhave built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer\r\nthereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace\r\nofferings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; 22:24 And if we\r\nhave not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to\r\ncome your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye\r\nto do with the LORD God of Israel?  22:25 For the LORD hath made\r\nJordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children\r\nof Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our\r\nchildren cease from fearing the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not\r\nfor burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 22:27 But that it may be a\r\nwitness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we\r\nmight do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings,\r\nand with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your\r\nchildren may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part\r\nin the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:28 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to\r\nus or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again,\r\nBehold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made,\r\nnot for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness\r\nbetween us and you.\r\n\r\n22:29 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this\r\nday from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings,\r\nfor meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD\r\nour God that is before his tabernacle.\r\n\r\n22:30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the\r\ncongregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him,\r\nheard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad\r\nand the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.\r\n\r\n22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the\r\nchildren of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of\r\nManasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye\r\nhave not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have\r\ndelivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,\r\nreturned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad,\r\nout of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of\r\nIsrael, and brought them word again.\r\n\r\n22:33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children\r\nof Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in\r\nbattle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad\r\ndwelt.\r\n\r\n22:34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the\r\naltar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.\r\n\r\n23:1 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given\r\nrest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed\r\nold and stricken in age.\r\n\r\n23:2 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for\r\ntheir heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said\r\nunto them, I am old and stricken in age: 23:3 And ye have seen all\r\nthat the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of\r\nyou; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.\r\n\r\n23:4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,\r\nto be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the\r\nnations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.\r\n\r\n23:5 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and\r\ndrive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as\r\nthe LORD your God hath promised unto you.\r\n\r\n23:6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is\r\nwritten in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside\r\ntherefrom to the right hand or to the left; 23:7 That ye come not\r\namong these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention\r\nof the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve\r\nthem, nor bow yourselves unto them: 23:8 But cleave unto the LORD your\r\nGod, as ye have done unto this day.\r\n\r\n23:9 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and\r\nstrong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n23:10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he\r\nit is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.\r\n\r\n23:11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD\r\nyour God.\r\n\r\n23:12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant\r\nof these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make\r\nmarriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 23:13 Know\r\nfor a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of\r\nthese nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto\r\nyou, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye\r\nperish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.\r\n\r\n23:14 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and\r\nye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing\r\nhath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake\r\nconcerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath\r\nfailed thereof.\r\n\r\n23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are\r\ncome upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD\r\nbring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off\r\nthis good land which the LORD your God hath given you.\r\n\r\n23:16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,\r\nwhich he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed\r\nyourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled\r\nagainst you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which\r\nhe hath given unto you.\r\n\r\n24:1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and\r\ncalled for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their\r\njudges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n24:2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of\r\nIsrael, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time,\r\neven Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they\r\nserved other gods.\r\n\r\n24:3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,\r\nand led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his\r\nseed, and gave him Isaac.\r\n\r\n24:4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount\r\nSeir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.\r\n\r\n24:5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to\r\nthat which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.\r\n\r\n24:6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the\r\nsea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and\r\nhorsemen unto the Red sea.\r\n\r\n24:7 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you\r\nand the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them;\r\nand your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the\r\nwilderness a long season.\r\n\r\n24:8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on\r\nthe other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into\r\nyour hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\n24:9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred\r\nagainst Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse\r\nyou: 24:10 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed\r\nyou still: so I delivered you out of his hand.\r\n\r\n24:11 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of\r\nJericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the\r\nCanaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and\r\nthe Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.\r\n\r\n24:12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from\r\nbefore you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy\r\nsword, nor with thy bow.\r\n\r\n24:13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and\r\ncities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and\r\noliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.\r\n\r\n24:14 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in\r\ntruth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other\r\nside of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this\r\nday whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served\r\nthat were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites,\r\nin whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n24:16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should\r\nforsake the LORD, to serve other gods; 24:17 For the LORD our God, he\r\nit is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt,\r\nfrom the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our\r\nsight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all\r\nthe people through whom we passed: 24:18 And the LORD drave out from\r\nbefore us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land:\r\ntherefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.\r\n\r\n24:19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for\r\nhe is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your\r\ntransgressions nor your sins.\r\n\r\n24:20 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will\r\nturn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n24:21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n24:22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against\r\nyourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they\r\nsaid, We are witnesses.\r\n\r\n24:23 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are\r\namong you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n24:24 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,\r\nand his voice will we obey.\r\n\r\n24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them\r\na statute and an ordinance in Shechem.\r\n\r\n24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and\r\ntook a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the\r\nsanctuary of the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be\r\na witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which\r\nhe spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye\r\ndeny your God.\r\n\r\n24:28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.\r\n\r\n24:29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of\r\nNun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n24:30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in\r\nTimnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill\r\nof Gaash.\r\n\r\n24:31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the\r\ndays of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the\r\nworks of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.\r\n\r\n24:32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up\r\nout of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which\r\nJacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred\r\npieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill\r\nthat pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount\r\nEphraim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Judges\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children\r\nof Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the\r\nCanaanites first, to fight against them?  1:2 And the LORD said, Judah\r\nshall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.\r\n\r\n1:3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my\r\nlot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go\r\nwith thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.\r\n\r\n1:4 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the\r\nPerizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\n1:5 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him,\r\nand they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.\r\n\r\n1:6 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,\r\nand cut off his thumbs and his great toes.\r\n\r\n1:7 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs\r\nand their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I\r\nhave done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,\r\nand there he died.\r\n\r\n1:8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had\r\ntaken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city\r\non fire.\r\n\r\n1:9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the\r\nCanaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n1:10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now\r\nthe name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and\r\nAhiman, and Talmai.\r\n\r\n1:11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the\r\nname of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: 1:12 And Caleb said, He that\r\nsmiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my\r\ndaughter to wife.\r\n\r\n1:13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother, took it:\r\nand he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\r\n\r\n1:14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to\r\nask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb\r\nsaid unto her, What wilt thou?  1:15 And she said unto him, Give me a\r\nblessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of\r\nwater. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.\r\n\r\n1:16 And the children of the Kenite, Moses\xe2\x80\x99 father in law, went up out\r\nof the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the\r\nwilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went\r\nand dwelt among the people.\r\n\r\n1:17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the\r\nCanaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the\r\nname of the city was called Hormah.\r\n\r\n1:18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the\r\ncoast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.\r\n\r\n1:19 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of\r\nthe mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,\r\nbecause they had chariots of iron.\r\n\r\n1:20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled\r\nthence the three sons of Anak.\r\n\r\n1:21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that\r\ninhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of\r\nBenjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.\r\n\r\n1:22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and\r\nthe LORD was with them.\r\n\r\n1:23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of\r\nthe city before was Luz.)  1:24 And the spies saw a man come forth out\r\nof the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the\r\nentrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.\r\n\r\n1:25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote\r\nthe city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\n1:26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,\r\nand called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n1:27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and\r\nher towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and\r\nher towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the\r\ninhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell\r\nin that land.\r\n\r\n1:28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the\r\nCanaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.\r\n\r\n1:29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;\r\nbut the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.\r\n\r\n1:30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the\r\ninhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and\r\nbecame tributaries.\r\n\r\n1:31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the\r\ninhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor\r\nof Aphik, nor of Rehob: 1:32 But the Asherites dwelt among the\r\nCanaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them\r\nout.\r\n\r\n1:33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,\r\nnor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites,\r\nthe inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of\r\nBethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.\r\n\r\n1:34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:\r\nfor they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 1:35 But\r\nthe Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim:\r\nyet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\n1:36 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,\r\nfrom the rock, and upward.\r\n\r\n2:1 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,\r\nI made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land\r\nwhich I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my\r\ncovenant with you.\r\n\r\n2:2 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye\r\nshall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why\r\nhave ye done this?  2:3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them\r\nout from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and\r\ntheir gods shall be a snare unto you.\r\n\r\n2:4 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words\r\nunto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their\r\nvoice, and wept.\r\n\r\n2:5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed\r\nthere unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:6 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went\r\nevery man unto his inheritance to possess the land.\r\n\r\n2:7 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the\r\ndays of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great\r\nworks of the LORD, that he did for Israel.\r\n\r\n2:8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an\r\nhundred and ten years old.\r\n\r\n2:9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in\r\nTimnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill\r\nGaash.\r\n\r\n2:10 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:\r\nand there arose another generation after them, which knew not the\r\nLORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.\r\n\r\n2:11 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and\r\nserved Baalim: 2:12 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,\r\nwhich brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,\r\nof the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed\r\nthemselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.\r\n\r\n2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.\r\n\r\n2:14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he\r\ndelivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he\r\nsold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they\r\ncould not any longer stand before their enemies.\r\n\r\n2:15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against\r\nthem for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto\r\nthem: and they were greatly distressed.\r\n\r\n2:16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out\r\nof the hand of those that spoiled them.\r\n\r\n2:17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a\r\nwhoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned\r\nquickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the\r\ncommandments of the LORD; but they did not so.\r\n\r\n2:18 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with\r\nthe judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the\r\ndays of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings\r\nby reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.\r\n\r\n2:19 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,\r\nand corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other\r\ngods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from\r\ntheir own doings, nor from their stubborn way.\r\n\r\n2:20 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,\r\nBecause that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I\r\ncommanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 2:21 I\r\nalso will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations\r\nwhich Joshua left when he died: 2:22 That through them I may prove\r\nIsrael, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as\r\ntheir fathers did keep it, or not.\r\n\r\n2:23 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out\r\nhastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.\r\n\r\n3:1 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by\r\nthem, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\r\n3:2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to\r\nteach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 3:3\r\nNamely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the\r\nSidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount\r\nBaalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.\r\n\r\n3:4 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would\r\nhearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their\r\nfathers by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n3:5 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,\r\nand Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 3:6 And they\r\ntook their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to\r\ntheir sons, and served their gods.\r\n\r\n3:7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and\r\nforgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.\r\n\r\n3:8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he\r\nsold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and\r\nthe children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.\r\n\r\n3:9 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD\r\nraised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them,\r\neven Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\xe2\x80\x99s younger brother.\r\n\r\n3:10 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel,\r\nand went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of\r\nMesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against\r\nChushanrishathaim.\r\n\r\n3:11 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n3:12 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\r\nLORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,\r\nbecause they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:13 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and\r\nwent and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.\r\n\r\n3:14 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n3:15 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD\r\nraised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man\r\nlefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto\r\nEglon the king of Moab.\r\n\r\n3:16 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit\r\nlength; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.\r\n\r\n3:17 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was\r\na very fat man.\r\n\r\n3:18 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away\r\nthe people that bare the present.\r\n\r\n3:19 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by\r\nGilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said,\r\nKeep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\r\n\r\n3:20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,\r\nwhich he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from\r\nGod unto thee.\r\n\r\nAnd he arose out of his seat.\r\n\r\n3:21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his\r\nright thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 3:22 And the haft also went\r\nin after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he\r\ncould not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.\r\n\r\n3:23 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the\r\nparlour upon him, and locked them.\r\n\r\n3:24 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,\r\nbehold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he\r\ncovereth his feet in his summer chamber.\r\n\r\n3:25 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened\r\nnot the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened\r\nthem: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.\r\n\r\n3:26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the\r\nquarries, and escaped unto Seirath.\r\n\r\n3:27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in\r\nthe mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him\r\nfrom the mount, and he before them.\r\n\r\n3:28 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath\r\ndelivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down\r\nafter him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not\r\na man to pass over.\r\n\r\n3:29 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all\r\nlusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.\r\n\r\n3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the\r\nland had rest fourscore years.\r\n\r\n3:31 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the\r\nPhilistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n4:1 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the\r\nLORD, when Ehud was dead.\r\n\r\n4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that\r\nreigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in\r\nHarosheth of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n4:3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine\r\nhundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n4:4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n4:5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and\r\nBethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n4:6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of\r\nKedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel\r\ncommanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee\r\nten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of\r\nZebulun?  4:7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera,\r\nthe captain of Jabin\xe2\x80\x99s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and\r\nI will deliver him into thine hand.\r\n\r\n4:8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:\r\nbut if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.\r\n\r\n4:9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the\r\njourney that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD\r\nshall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and\r\nwent with Barak to Kedesh.\r\n\r\n4:10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up\r\nwith ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.\r\n\r\n4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the\r\nfather in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and\r\npitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.\r\n\r\n4:12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up\r\nto mount Tabor.\r\n\r\n4:13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred\r\nchariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from\r\nHarosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.\r\n\r\n4:14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the\r\nLORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out\r\nbefore thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n4:15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all\r\nhis host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera\r\nlighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.\r\n\r\n4:16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto\r\nHarosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the\r\nedge of the sword; and there was not a man left.\r\n\r\n4:17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife\r\nof Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of\r\nHazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\r\n\r\n4:18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my\r\nlord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into\r\nthe tent, she covered him with a mantle.\r\n\r\n4:19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to\r\ndrink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him\r\ndrink, and covered him.\r\n\r\n4:20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it\r\nshall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is\r\nthere any man here? that thou shalt say, No.\r\n\r\n4:21 Then Jael Heber\xe2\x80\x99s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an\r\nhammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into\r\nhis temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep\r\nand weary. So he died.\r\n\r\n4:22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,\r\nand said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou\r\nseekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and\r\nthe nail was in his temples.\r\n\r\n4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n4:24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed\r\nagainst Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king\r\nof Canaan.\r\n\r\n5:1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,\r\nsaying, 5:2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the\r\npeople willingly offered themselves.\r\n\r\n5:3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing\r\nunto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:4 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of\r\nthe field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the\r\nclouds also dropped water.\r\n\r\n5:5 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from\r\nbefore the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the\r\nhighways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.\r\n\r\n5:7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,\r\nuntil that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.\r\n\r\n5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield\r\nor spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  5:9 My heart is toward\r\nthe governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the\r\npeople. Bless ye the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and\r\nwalk by the way.\r\n\r\n5:11 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places\r\nof drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the\r\nLORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages\r\nin Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.\r\n\r\n5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,\r\nand lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.\r\n\r\n5:13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles\r\namong the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.\r\n\r\n5:14 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after\r\nthee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors,\r\nand out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.\r\n\r\n5:15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and\r\nalso Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of\r\nReuben there were great thoughts of heart.\r\n\r\n5:16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of\r\nthe flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n5:17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?\r\nAsher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.\r\n\r\n5:18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives\r\nunto the death in the high places of the field.\r\n\r\n5:19 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in\r\nTaanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.\r\n\r\n5:20 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought\r\nagainst Sisera.\r\n\r\n5:21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the\r\nriver Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.\r\n\r\n5:22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,\r\nthe pransings of their mighty ones.\r\n\r\n5:23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the\r\ninhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to\r\nthe help of the LORD against the mighty.\r\n\r\n5:24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,\r\nblessed shall she be above women in the tent.\r\n\r\n5:25 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter\r\nin a lordly dish.\r\n\r\n5:26 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,\r\nwhen she had pierced and stricken through his temples.\r\n\r\n5:27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,\r\nhe fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\r\n\r\n5:28 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through\r\nthe lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the\r\nwheels of his chariots?  5:29 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she\r\nreturned answer to herself, 5:30 Have they not sped? have they not\r\ndivided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of\r\ndivers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers\r\ncolours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that\r\ntake the spoil?  5:31 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let\r\nthem that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And\r\nthe land had rest forty years.\r\n\r\n6:1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and\r\nthe LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.\r\n\r\n6:2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of\r\nthe Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in\r\nthe mountains, and caves, and strong holds.\r\n\r\n6:3 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,\r\nand the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up\r\nagainst them; 6:4 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the\r\nincrease of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no\r\nsustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.\r\n\r\n6:5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came\r\nas grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were\r\nwithout number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.\r\n\r\n6:6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and\r\nthe children of Israel cried unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:7 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the\r\nLORD because of the Midianites, 6:8 That the LORD sent a prophet unto\r\nthe children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God\r\nof Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of\r\nthe house of bondage; 6:9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the\r\nEgyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave\r\nthem out from before you, and gave you their land; 6:10 And I said\r\nunto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites,\r\nin whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.\r\n\r\n6:11 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which\r\nwas in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son\r\nGideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the\r\nMidianites.\r\n\r\n6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,\r\nThe LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.\r\n\r\n6:13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why\r\nthen is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our\r\nfathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?\r\nbut now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of\r\nthe Midianites.\r\n\r\n6:14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and\r\nthou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I\r\nsent thee?  6:15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I\r\nsave Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the\r\nleast in my father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n6:16 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou\r\nshalt smite the Midianites as one man.\r\n\r\n6:17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,\r\nthen shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.\r\n\r\n6:18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring\r\nforth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry\r\nuntil thou come again.\r\n\r\n6:19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of\r\nan ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth\r\nin a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.\r\n\r\n6:20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the\r\nunleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.\r\nAnd he did so.\r\n\r\n6:21 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that\r\nwas in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and\r\nthere rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the\r\nunleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n6:22 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,\r\nGideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the\r\nLORD face to face.\r\n\r\n6:23 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou\r\nshalt not die.\r\n\r\n6:24 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it\r\nJehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\r\n\r\n6:25 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,\r\nTake thy father\xe2\x80\x99s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven\r\nyears old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and\r\ncut down the grove that is by it: 6:26 And build an altar unto the\r\nLORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take\r\nthe second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the\r\ngrove which thou shalt cut down.\r\n\r\n6:27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had\r\nsaid unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day,\r\nthat he did it by night.\r\n\r\n6:28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,\r\nthe altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was\r\nby it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n6:29 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when\r\nthey enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done\r\nthis thing.\r\n\r\n6:30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that\r\nhe may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because\r\nhe hath cut down the grove that was by it.\r\n\r\n6:31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for\r\nBaal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to\r\ndeath whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for\r\nhimself, because one hath cast down his altar.\r\n\r\n6:32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal\r\nplead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.\r\n\r\n6:33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of\r\nthe east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the\r\nvalley of Jezreel.\r\n\r\n6:34 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a\r\ntrumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.\r\n\r\n6:35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was\r\ngathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto\r\nZebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\r\n\r\n6:36 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,\r\nas thou hast said, 6:37 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the\r\nfloor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all\r\nthe earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine\r\nhand, as thou hast said.\r\n\r\n6:38 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the\r\nfleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n6:39 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me,\r\nand I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this\r\nonce with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon\r\nall the ground let there be dew.\r\n\r\n6:40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only,\r\nand there was dew on all the ground.\r\n\r\n7:1 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with\r\nhim, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the\r\nhost of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of\r\nMoreh, in the valley.\r\n\r\n7:2 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are\r\ntoo many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel\r\nvaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.\r\n\r\n7:3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,\r\nWhosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from\r\nmount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two\r\nthousand; and there remained ten thousand.\r\n\r\n7:4 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring\r\nthem down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it\r\nshall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the\r\nsame shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall\r\nnot go with thee, the same shall not go.\r\n\r\n7:5 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said\r\nunto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a\r\ndog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that\r\nboweth down upon his knees to drink.\r\n\r\n7:6 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their\r\nmouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed\r\ndown upon their knees to drink water.\r\n\r\n7:7 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that\r\nlapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand:\r\nand let all the other people go every man unto his place.\r\n\r\n7:8 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and\r\nhe sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained\r\nthose three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n7:9 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,\r\nArise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n7:10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down\r\nto the host: 7:11 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward\r\nshall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went\r\nhe down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that\r\nwere in the host.\r\n\r\n7:12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the\r\neast lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and\r\ntheir camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n7:13 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a\r\ndream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a\r\ncake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a\r\ntent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n7:14 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the\r\nsword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand\r\nhath God delivered Midian, and all the host.\r\n\r\n7:15 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and\r\nthe interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the\r\nhost of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your\r\nhand the host of Midian.\r\n\r\n7:16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he\r\nput a trumpet in every man\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps\r\nwithin the pitchers.\r\n\r\n7:17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,\r\nwhen I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so\r\nshall ye do.\r\n\r\n7:18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow\r\nye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword\r\nof the LORD, and of Gideon.\r\n\r\n7:19 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the\r\noutside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had\r\nbut newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the\r\npitchers that were in their hands.\r\n\r\n7:20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the\r\npitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in\r\ntheir right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the\r\nLORD, and of Gideon.\r\n\r\n7:21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and\r\nall the host ran, and cried, and fled.\r\n\r\n7:22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the\r\nhost fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of\r\nAbelmeholah, unto Tabbath.\r\n\r\n7:23 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of\r\nNaphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after\r\nthe Midianites.\r\n\r\n7:24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,\r\ncome down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto\r\nBethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves\r\ntogether, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.\r\n\r\n7:25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and\r\nthey slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress\r\nof Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to\r\nGideon on the other side Jordan.\r\n\r\n8:1 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us\r\nthus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the\r\nMidianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.\r\n\r\n8:2 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?\r\nIs not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage\r\nof Abiezer?  8:3 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of\r\nMidian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?\r\nThen their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.\r\n\r\n8:4 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three\r\nhundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.\r\n\r\n8:5 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of\r\nbread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am\r\npursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\r\n\r\n8:6 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and\r\nZalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?\r\n8:7 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and\r\nZalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns\r\nof the wilderness and with briers.\r\n\r\n8:8 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and\r\nthe men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.\r\n\r\n8:9 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come\r\nagain in peace, I will break down this tower.\r\n\r\n8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,\r\nabout fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the\r\nchildren of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand\r\nmen that drew sword.\r\n\r\n8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the\r\neast of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\n8:12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took\r\nthe two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n8:13 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun\r\nwas up, 8:14 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and\r\nenquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and\r\nthe elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.\r\n\r\n8:15 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and\r\nZalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah\r\nand Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men\r\nthat are weary?  8:16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns\r\nof the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of\r\nSuccoth.\r\n\r\n8:17 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n8:18 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were\r\nthey whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were\r\nthey; each one resembled the children of a king.\r\n\r\n8:19 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:\r\nas the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.\r\n\r\n8:20 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the\r\nyouth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.\r\n\r\n8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as\r\nthe man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and\r\nZalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnecks.\r\n\r\n8:22 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both\r\nthou, and thy son, and thy son\xe2\x80\x99s son also: for thou hast delivered us\r\nfrom the hand of Midian.\r\n\r\n8:23 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither\r\nshall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.\r\n\r\n8:24 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that\r\nye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had\r\ngolden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)  8:25 And they\r\nanswered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and\r\ndid cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.\r\n\r\n8:26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a\r\nthousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and\r\ncollars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and\r\nbeside the chains that were about their camels\xe2\x80\x99 necks.\r\n\r\n8:27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in\r\nOphrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing\r\nbecame a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.\r\n\r\n8:28 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that\r\nthey lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness\r\nforty years in the days of Gideon.\r\n\r\n8:29 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.\r\n\r\n8:30 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for\r\nhe had many wives.\r\n\r\n8:31 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,\r\nwhose name he called Abimelech.\r\n\r\n8:32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was\r\nburied in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the\r\nAbiezrites.\r\n\r\n8:33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the\r\nchildren of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and\r\nmade Baalberith their god.\r\n\r\n8:34 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who\r\nhad delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every\r\nside: 8:35 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,\r\nnamely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n9:1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of\r\nthe house of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s father, saying, 9:2 Speak, I pray you, in\r\nthe ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either\r\nthat all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons,\r\nreign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am\r\nyour bone and your flesh.\r\n\r\n9:3 And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men\r\nof Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow\r\nAbimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\r\n\r\n9:4 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the\r\nhouse of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,\r\nwhich followed him.\r\n\r\n9:5 And he went unto his father\xe2\x80\x99s house at Ophrah, and slew his\r\nbrethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon\r\none stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal\r\nwas left; for he hid himself.\r\n\r\n9:6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of\r\nMillo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar\r\nthat was in Shechem.\r\n\r\n9:7 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of\r\nmount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them,\r\nHearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.\r\n\r\n9:8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and\r\nthey said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.\r\n\r\n9:9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,\r\nwherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over\r\nthe trees?  9:10 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and\r\nreign over us.\r\n\r\n9:11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,\r\nand my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?  9:12 Then\r\nsaid the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.\r\n\r\n9:13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which\r\ncheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?  9:14 Then\r\nsaid all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.\r\n\r\n9:15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me\r\nking over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not,\r\nlet fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n9:16 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye\r\nhave made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and\r\nhis house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his\r\nhands; 9:17 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life\r\nfar, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 9:18 And ye are\r\nrisen up against my father\xe2\x80\x99s house this day, and have slain his sons,\r\nthreescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech,\r\nthe son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he\r\nis your brother;) 9:19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with\r\nJerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech,\r\nand let him also rejoice in you: 9:20 But if not, let fire come out\r\nfrom Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo;\r\nand let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of\r\nMillo, and devour Abimelech.\r\n\r\n9:21 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,\r\nfor fear of Abimelech his brother.\r\n\r\n9:22 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 9:23 Then God\r\nsent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the\r\nmen of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 9:24 That the\r\ncruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come,\r\nand their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them;\r\nand upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n9:25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of\r\nthe mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them:\r\nand it was told Abimelech.\r\n\r\n9:26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to\r\nShechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.\r\n\r\n9:27 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,\r\nand trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their\r\ngod, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.\r\n\r\n9:28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is\r\nShechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and\r\nZebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for\r\nwhy should we serve him?  9:29 And would to God this people were under\r\nmy hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech,\r\nIncrease thine army, and come out.\r\n\r\n9:30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the\r\nson of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\r\n\r\n9:31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,\r\nGaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold,\r\nthey fortify the city against thee.\r\n\r\n9:32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,\r\nand lie in wait in the field: 9:33 And it shall be, that in the\r\nmorning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon\r\nthe city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come\r\nout against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n9:34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by\r\nnight, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.\r\n\r\n9:35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of\r\nthe gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were\r\nwith him, from lying in wait.\r\n\r\n9:36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there\r\ncome people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto\r\nhim, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.\r\n\r\n9:37 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the\r\nmiddle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of\r\nMeonenim.\r\n\r\n9:38 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou\r\nsaidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the\r\npeople that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n9:39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with\r\nAbimelech.\r\n\r\n9:40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were\r\noverthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.\r\n\r\n9:41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his\r\nbrethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.\r\n\r\n9:42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into\r\nthe field; and they told Abimelech.\r\n\r\n9:43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,\r\nand laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were\r\ncome forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n9:44 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,\r\nand stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other\r\ncompanies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took\r\nthe city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the\r\ncity, and sowed it with salt.\r\n\r\n9:46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they\r\nentered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.\r\n\r\n9:47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of\r\nShechem were gathered together.\r\n\r\n9:48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people\r\nthat were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut\r\ndown a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder,\r\nand said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do,\r\nmake haste, and do as I have done.\r\n\r\n9:49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and\r\nfollowed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire\r\nupon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also,\r\nabout a thousand men and women.\r\n\r\n9:50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and\r\ntook it.\r\n\r\n9:51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled\r\nall the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them,\r\nand gat them up to the top of the tower.\r\n\r\n9:52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and\r\nwent hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\r\n\r\n9:53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead, and all to brake his skull.\r\n\r\n9:54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and\r\nsaid unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A\r\nwomen slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.\r\n\r\n9:55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they\r\ndeparted every man unto his place.\r\n\r\n9:56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto\r\nhis father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 9:57 And all the evil of\r\nthe men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came\r\nthe curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.\r\n\r\n10:1 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of\r\nPuah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in\r\nmount Ephraim.\r\n\r\n10:2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was\r\nburied in Shamir.\r\n\r\n10:3 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty\r\nand two years.\r\n\r\n10:4 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they\r\nhad thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which\r\nare in the land of Gilead.\r\n\r\n10:5 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.\r\n\r\n10:6 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\r\nLORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the\r\ngods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of\r\nAmmon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and\r\nserved not him.\r\n\r\n10:7 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold\r\nthem into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the\r\nchildren of Ammon.\r\n\r\n10:8 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:\r\neighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side\r\nJordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.\r\n\r\n10:9 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also\r\nagainst Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim;\r\nso that Israel was sore distressed.\r\n\r\n10:10 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have\r\nsinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also\r\nserved Baalim.\r\n\r\n10:11 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver\r\nyou from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of\r\nAmmon, and from the Philistines?  10:12 The Zidonians also, and the\r\nAmalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and\r\nI delivered you out of their hand.\r\n\r\n10:13 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will\r\ndeliver you no more.\r\n\r\n10:14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver\r\nyou in the time of your tribulation.\r\n\r\n10:15 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:\r\ndo thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we\r\npray thee, this day.\r\n\r\n10:16 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served\r\nthe LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\r\n\r\n10:17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped\r\nin Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together,\r\nand encamped in Mizpeh.\r\n\r\n10:18 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What\r\nman is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he\r\nshall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\r\n\r\n11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was\r\nthe son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.\r\n\r\n11:2 And Gilead\xe2\x80\x99s wife bare him sons; and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s sons grew up, and\r\nthey thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in\r\nour father\xe2\x80\x99s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.\r\n\r\n11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of\r\nTob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n11:4 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of\r\nAmmon made war against Israel.\r\n\r\n11:5 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against\r\nIsrael, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of\r\nTob: 11:6 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that\r\nwe may fight with the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n11:7 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,\r\nand expel me out of my father\xe2\x80\x99s house? and why are ye come unto me now\r\nwhen ye are in distress?  11:8 And the elders of Gilead said unto\r\nJephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go\r\nwith us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over\r\nall the inhabitants of Gilead.\r\n\r\n11:9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home\r\nagain to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver\r\nthem before me, shall I be your head?  11:10 And the elders of Gilead\r\nsaid unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so\r\naccording to thy words.\r\n\r\n11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people\r\nmade him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his\r\nwords before the LORD in Mizpeh.\r\n\r\n11:12 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of\r\nAmmon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come\r\nagainst me to fight in my land?  11:13 And the king of the children of\r\nAmmon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took\r\naway my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto\r\nJabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again\r\npeaceably.\r\n\r\n11:14 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children\r\nof Ammon: 11:15 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took\r\nnot away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:\r\n11:16 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the\r\nwilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 11:17 Then Israel\r\nsent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee,\r\npass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.\r\nAnd in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not\r\nconsent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.\r\n\r\n11:18 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the\r\nland of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the\r\nland of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not\r\nwithin the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.\r\n\r\n11:19 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the\r\nking of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,\r\nthrough thy land into my place.\r\n\r\n11:20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but\r\nSihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and\r\nfought against Israel.\r\n\r\n11:21 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people\r\ninto the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all\r\nthe land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\r\n\r\n11:22 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon\r\neven unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.\r\n\r\n11:23 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites\r\nfrom before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?  11:24\r\nWilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to\r\npossess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before\r\nus, them will we possess.\r\n\r\n11:25 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor,\r\nking of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight\r\nagainst them, 11:26 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and\r\nin Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the\r\ncoasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover\r\nthem within that time?  11:27 Wherefore I have not sinned against\r\nthee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be\r\njudge this day between the children of Israel and the children of\r\nAmmon.\r\n\r\n11:28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the\r\nwords of Jephthah which he sent him.\r\n\r\n11:29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed\r\nover Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from\r\nMizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n11:30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt\r\nwithout fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 11:31 Then\r\nit shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to\r\nmeet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall\r\nsurely be the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.\r\n\r\n11:32 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight\r\nagainst them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.\r\n\r\n11:33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,\r\neven twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very\r\ngreat slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n11:34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his\r\ndaughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she\r\nwas his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.\r\n\r\n11:35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,\r\nand said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou\r\nart one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the\r\nLORD, and I cannot go back.\r\n\r\n11:36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth\r\nunto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of\r\nthy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of\r\nthine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n11:37 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let\r\nme alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and\r\nbewail my virginity, I and my fellows.\r\n\r\n11:38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she\r\nwent with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n11:39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned\r\nunto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had\r\nvowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 11:40 That\r\nthe daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah\r\nthe Gileadite four days in a year.\r\n\r\n12:1 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went\r\nnorthward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to\r\nfight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with\r\nthee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.\r\n\r\n12:2 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife\r\nwith the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not\r\nout of their hands.\r\n\r\n12:3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my\r\nhands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD\r\ndelivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me\r\nthis day, to fight against me?  12:4 Then Jephthah gathered together\r\nall the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead\r\nsmote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of\r\nEphraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.\r\n\r\n12:5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the\r\nEphraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were\r\nescaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him,\r\nArt thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 12:6 Then said they unto him,\r\nSay now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to\r\npronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages\r\nof Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and\r\ntwo thousand.\r\n\r\n12:7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the\r\nGileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\r\n\r\n12:8 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.\r\n\r\n12:9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent\r\nabroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he\r\njudged Israel seven years.\r\n\r\n12:10 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n12:11 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged\r\nIsrael ten years.\r\n\r\n12:12 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the\r\ncountry of Zebulun.\r\n\r\n12:13 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n12:14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on\r\nthreescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.\r\n\r\n12:15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried\r\nin Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.\r\n\r\n13:1 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\r\nLORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\n13:2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the\r\nDanites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.\r\n\r\n13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto\r\nher, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt\r\nconceive, and bear a son.\r\n\r\n13:4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong\r\ndrink, and eat not any unclean thing: 13:5 For, lo, thou shalt\r\nconceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the\r\nchild shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin\r\nto deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God\r\ncame unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel\r\nof God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told\r\nhe me his name: 13:7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive,\r\nand bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat\r\nany unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the\r\nwomb to the day of his death.\r\n\r\n13:8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man\r\nof God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we\r\nshall do unto the child that shall be born.\r\n\r\n13:9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God\r\ncame again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her\r\nhusband was not with her.\r\n\r\n13:10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and\r\nsaid unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto\r\nme the other day.\r\n\r\n13:11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,\r\nand said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And\r\nhe said, I am.\r\n\r\n13:12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we\r\norder the child, and how shall we do unto him?  13:13 And the angel of\r\nthe LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her\r\nbeware.\r\n\r\n13:14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither\r\nlet her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all\r\nthat I commanded her let her observe.\r\n\r\n13:15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us\r\ndetain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.\r\n\r\n13:16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain\r\nme, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt\r\noffering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that\r\nhe was an angel of the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,\r\nthat when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?  13:18 And\r\nthe angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my\r\nname, seeing it is secret?  13:19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat\r\noffering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did\r\nwonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.\r\n\r\n13:20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from\r\noff the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the\r\naltar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\n13:21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to\r\nhis wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we\r\nhave seen God.\r\n\r\n13:23 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,\r\nhe would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our\r\nhands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as\r\nat this time have told us such things as these.\r\n\r\n13:24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the\r\nchild grew, and the LORD blessed him.\r\n\r\n13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the\r\ncamp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.\r\n\r\n14:1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of\r\nthe daughters of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n14:2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I\r\nhave seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now\r\ntherefore get her for me to wife.\r\n\r\n14:3 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a\r\nwoman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people,\r\nthat thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And\r\nSamson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.\r\n\r\n14:4 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD,\r\nthat he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time\r\nthe Philistines had dominion over Israel.\r\n\r\n14:5 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,\r\nand came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n14:6 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent\r\nhim as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but\r\nhe told not his father or his mother what he had done.\r\n\r\n14:7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased\r\nSamson well.\r\n\r\n14:8 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to\r\nsee the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees\r\nand honey in the carcase of the lion.\r\n\r\n14:9 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to\r\nhis father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told\r\nnot them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.\r\n\r\n14:10 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a\r\nfeast; for so used the young men to do.\r\n\r\n14:11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty\r\ncompanions to be with him.\r\n\r\n14:12 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto\r\nyou: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the\r\nfeast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty\r\nchange of garments: 14:13 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall\r\nye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said\r\nunto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.\r\n\r\n14:14 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out\r\nof the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days\r\nexpound the riddle.\r\n\r\n14:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto\r\nSamson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the\r\nriddle, lest we burn thee and thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house with fire: have ye\r\ncalled us to take that we have? is it not so?  14:16 And Samson\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nwept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not:\r\nthou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast\r\nnot told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my\r\nfather nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?  14:17 And she wept\r\nbefore him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to\r\npass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon\r\nhim: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\r\n\r\n14:18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before\r\nthe sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger\r\nthan a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my\r\nheifer, ye had not found out my riddle.\r\n\r\n14:19 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to\r\nAshkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave\r\nchange of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger\r\nwas kindled, and he went up to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n14:20 But Samson\xe2\x80\x99s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used\r\nas his friend.\r\n\r\n15:1 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat\r\nharvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will\r\ngo in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him\r\nto go in.\r\n\r\n15:2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly\r\nhated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger\r\nsister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.\r\n\r\n15:3 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless\r\nthan the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.\r\n\r\n15:4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took\r\nfirebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst\r\nbetween two tails.\r\n\r\n15:5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the\r\nstanding corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and\r\nalso the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.\r\n\r\n15:6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,\r\nSamson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,\r\nand given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt\r\nher and her father with fire.\r\n\r\n15:7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I\r\nbe avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\r\n\r\n15:8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he\r\nwent down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.\r\n\r\n15:9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread\r\nthemselves in Lehi.\r\n\r\n15:10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And\r\nthey answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath\r\ndone to us.\r\n\r\n15:11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock\r\nEtam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are\r\nrulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said\r\nunto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.\r\n\r\n15:12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we\r\nmay deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said\r\nunto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.\r\n\r\n15:13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,\r\nand deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.\r\nAnd they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n15:14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him:\r\nand the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that\r\nwere upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his\r\nbands loosed from off his hands.\r\n\r\n15:15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,\r\nand took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.\r\n\r\n15:16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,\r\nwith the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.\r\n\r\n15:17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that\r\nhe cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place\r\nRamathlehi.\r\n\r\n15:18 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou\r\nhast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and\r\nnow shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the\r\nuncircumcised?  15:19 But God clave an hollow place that was in the\r\njaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit\r\ncame again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof\r\nEnhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.\r\n\r\n15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n16:1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in\r\nunto her.\r\n\r\n16:2 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And\r\nthey compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of\r\nthe city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when\r\nit is day, we shall kill him.\r\n\r\n16:3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the\r\ndoors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with\r\nthem, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them\r\nup to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.\r\n\r\n16:4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the\r\nvalley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\r\n\r\n16:5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto\r\nher, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what\r\nmeans we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him;\r\nand we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.\r\n\r\n16:6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy\r\ngreat strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n16:7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs\r\nthat were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\r\n\r\n16:8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green\r\nwiths which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.\r\n\r\n16:9 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nAnd she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he\r\nbrake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the\r\nfire. So his strength was not known.\r\n\r\n16:10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and\r\ntold me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be\r\nbound.\r\n\r\n16:11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that\r\nnever were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.\r\n\r\n16:12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and\r\nsaid unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were\r\nliers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his\r\narms like a thread.\r\n\r\n16:13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and\r\ntold me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said\r\nunto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.\r\n\r\n16:14 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The\r\nPhilistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and\r\nwent away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.\r\n\r\n16:15 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when\r\nthine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and\r\nhast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.\r\n\r\n16:16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,\r\nand urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; 16:17 That he\r\ntold her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor\r\nupon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwomb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall\r\nbecome weak, and be like any other man.\r\n\r\n16:18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she\r\nsent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this\r\nonce, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the\r\nPhilistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.\r\n\r\n16:19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man,\r\nand she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she\r\nbegan to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\r\n\r\n16:20 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke\r\nout of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before,\r\nand shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.\r\n\r\n16:21 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought\r\nhim down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did\r\ngrind in the prison house.\r\n\r\n16:22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was\r\nshaven.\r\n\r\n16:23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to\r\noffer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they\r\nsaid, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.\r\n\r\n16:24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they\r\nsaid, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the\r\ndestroyer of our country, which slew many of us.\r\n\r\n16:25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they\r\nsaid, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for\r\nSamson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set\r\nhim between the pillars.\r\n\r\n16:26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer\r\nme that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I\r\nmay lean upon them.\r\n\r\n16:27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of\r\nthe Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three\r\nthousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.\r\n\r\n16:28 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember\r\nme, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O\r\nGod, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.\r\n\r\n16:29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the\r\nhouse stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right\r\nhand, and of the other with his left.\r\n\r\n16:30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed\r\nhimself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and\r\nupon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at\r\nhis death were more than they which he slew in his life.\r\n\r\n16:31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and\r\ntook him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol\r\nin the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n17:1 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\r\n\r\n17:2 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver\r\nthat were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of\r\nalso in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his\r\nmother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.\r\n\r\n17:3 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to\r\nhis mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto\r\nthe LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten\r\nimage: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.\r\n\r\n17:4 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took\r\ntwo hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made\r\nthereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house\r\nof Micah.\r\n\r\n17:5 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and\r\nteraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\r\n\r\n17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that\r\nwhich was right in his own eyes.\r\n\r\n17:7 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of\r\nJudah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.\r\n\r\n17:8 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to\r\nsojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to\r\nthe house of Micah, as he journeyed.\r\n\r\n17:9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto\r\nhim, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may\r\nfind a place.\r\n\r\n17:10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father\r\nand a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year,\r\nand a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.\r\n\r\n17:11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young\r\nman was unto him as one of his sons.\r\n\r\n17:12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his\r\npriest, and was in the house of Micah.\r\n\r\n17:13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,\r\nseeing I have a Levite to my priest.\r\n\r\n18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the\r\ntribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto\r\nthat day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the\r\ntribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n18:2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their\r\ncoasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the\r\nland, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land:\r\nwho when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they\r\nlodged there.\r\n\r\n18:3 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the\r\nyoung man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him,\r\nWho brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what\r\nhast thou here?  18:4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth\r\nMicah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.\r\n\r\n18:5 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that\r\nwe may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.\r\n\r\n18:6 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is\r\nyour way wherein ye go.\r\n\r\n18:7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people\r\nthat were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the\r\nZidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,\r\nthat might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the\r\nZidonians, and had no business with any man.\r\n\r\n18:8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their\r\nbrethren said unto them, What say ye?  18:9 And they said, Arise, that\r\nwe may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it\r\nis very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to\r\npossess the land.\r\n\r\n18:10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large\r\nland: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no\r\nwant of any thing that is in the earth.\r\n\r\n18:11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of\r\nZorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n18:12 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:\r\nwherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it\r\nis behind Kirjathjearim.\r\n\r\n18:13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the\r\nhouse of Micah.\r\n\r\n18:14 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of\r\nLaish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these\r\nhouses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?\r\nnow therefore consider what ye have to do.\r\n\r\n18:15 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young\r\nman the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.\r\n\r\n18:16 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,\r\nwhich were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.\r\n\r\n18:17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came\r\nin thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the\r\nteraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering\r\nof the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n18:18 And these went into Micah\xe2\x80\x99s house, and fetched the carved image,\r\nthe ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the\r\npriest unto them, What do ye?  18:19 And they said unto him, Hold thy\r\npeace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a\r\nfather and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the\r\nhouse of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family\r\nin Israel?  18:20 And the priest\xe2\x80\x99s heart was glad, and he took the\r\nephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n18:21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the\r\ncattle and the carriage before them.\r\n\r\n18:22 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men\r\nthat were in the houses near to Micah\xe2\x80\x99s house were gathered together,\r\nand overtook the children of Dan.\r\n\r\n18:23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their\r\nfaces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with\r\nsuch a company?  18:24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I\r\nmade, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and\r\nwhat is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?  18:25 And the\r\nchildren of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us,\r\nlest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the\r\nlives of thy household.\r\n\r\n18:26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that\r\nthey were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.\r\n\r\n18:27 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest\r\nwhich he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet\r\nand secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt\r\nthe city with fire.\r\n\r\n18:28 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and\r\nthey had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth\r\nby Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.\r\n\r\n18:29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan\r\ntheir father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city\r\nwas Laish at the first.\r\n\r\n18:30 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,\r\nthe son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests\r\nto the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.\r\n\r\n18:31 And they set them up Micah\xe2\x80\x99s graven image, which he made, all\r\nthe time that the house of God was in Shiloh.\r\n\r\n19:1 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in\r\nIsrael, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of\r\nmount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.\r\n\r\n19:2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away\r\nfrom him unto her father\xe2\x80\x99s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four\r\nwhole months.\r\n\r\n19:3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto\r\nher, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple\r\nof asses: and she brought him into her father\xe2\x80\x99s house: and when the\r\nfather of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\r\n\r\n19:4 And his father in law, the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s father, retained him; and he\r\nabode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n19:5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in\r\nthe morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s father said\r\nunto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and\r\nafterward go your way.\r\n\r\n19:6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:\r\nfor the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray\r\nthee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.\r\n\r\n19:7 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:\r\ntherefore he lodged there again.\r\n\r\n19:8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and\r\nthe damsel\xe2\x80\x99s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they\r\ntarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.\r\n\r\n19:9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and\r\nhis servant, his father in law, the damsel\xe2\x80\x99s father, said unto him,\r\nBehold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all\r\nnight: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart\r\nmay be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou\r\nmayest go home.\r\n\r\n19:10 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and\r\ndeparted, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there\r\nwere with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.\r\n\r\n19:11 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the\r\nservant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in\r\ninto this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.\r\n\r\n19:12 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into\r\nthe city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will\r\npass over to Gibeah.\r\n\r\n19:13 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one\r\nof these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.\r\n\r\n19:14 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down\r\nupon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.\r\n\r\n19:15 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:\r\nand when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for\r\nthere was no man that took them into his house to lodging.\r\n\r\n19:16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the\r\nfield at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in\r\nGibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.\r\n\r\n19:17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in\r\nthe street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and\r\nwhence comest thou?  19:18 And he said unto him, We are passing from\r\nBethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and\r\nI went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD;\r\nand there is no man that receiveth me to house.\r\n\r\n19:19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there\r\nis bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young\r\nman which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.\r\n\r\n19:20 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy\r\nwants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.\r\n\r\n19:21 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the\r\nasses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.\r\n\r\n19:22 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of\r\nthe city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and\r\nbeat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man,\r\nsaying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may\r\nknow him.\r\n\r\n19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and\r\nsaid unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;\r\nseeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.\r\n\r\n19:24 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I\r\nwill bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth\r\ngood unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.\r\n\r\n19:25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his\r\nconcubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and\r\nabused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to\r\nspring, they let her go.\r\n\r\n19:26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at\r\nthe door of the man\xe2\x80\x99s house where her lord was, till it was light.\r\n\r\n19:27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the\r\nhouse, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his\r\nconcubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were\r\nupon the threshold.\r\n\r\n19:28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThen the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him\r\nunto his place.\r\n\r\n19:29 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid\r\nhold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into\r\ntwelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.\r\n\r\n19:30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed\r\ndone nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of\r\nthe land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and\r\nspeak your minds.\r\n\r\n20:1 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation\r\nwas gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the\r\nland of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.\r\n\r\n20:2 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of\r\nIsrael, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,\r\nfour hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.\r\n\r\n20:3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel\r\nwere gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us,\r\nhow was this wickedness?  20:4 And the Levite, the husband of the\r\nwoman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that\r\nbelongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.\r\n\r\n20:5 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round\r\nabout upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine\r\nhave they forced, that she is dead.\r\n\r\n20:6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her\r\nthroughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have\r\ncommitted lewdness and folly in Israel.\r\n\r\n20:7 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n20:8 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of\r\nus go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.\r\n\r\n20:9 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we\r\nwill go up by lot against it; 20:10 And we will take ten men of an\r\nhundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a\r\nthousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the\r\npeople, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,\r\naccording to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.\r\n\r\n20:11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit\r\ntogether as one man.\r\n\r\n20:12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of\r\nBenjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?\r\n20:13 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which\r\nare in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from\r\nIsrael. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of\r\ntheir brethren the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n20:14 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of\r\nthe cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n20:15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of\r\nthe cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the\r\ninhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\r\n\r\n20:16 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men\r\nlefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not\r\nmiss.\r\n\r\n20:17 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four\r\nhundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.\r\n\r\n20:18 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of\r\nGod, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first\r\nto the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said,\r\nJudah shall go up first.\r\n\r\n20:19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped\r\nagainst Gibeah.\r\n\r\n20:20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and\r\nthe men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at\r\nGibeah.\r\n\r\n20:21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and\r\ndestroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\n20:22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set\r\ntheir battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in\r\narray the first day.\r\n\r\n20:23 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD\r\nuntil even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again\r\nto battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD\r\nsaid, Go up against him.)  20:24 And the children of Israel came near\r\nagainst the children of Benjamin the second day.\r\n\r\n20:25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second\r\nday, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again\r\neighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.\r\n\r\n20:26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,\r\nand came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the\r\nLORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and\r\npeace offerings before the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:27 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of\r\nthe covenant of God was there in those days, 20:28 And Phinehas, the\r\nson of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,)\r\nsaying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of\r\nBenjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for\r\nto morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.\r\n\r\n20:29 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.\r\n\r\n20:30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of\r\nBenjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah,\r\nas at other times.\r\n\r\n20:31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and\r\nwere drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people,\r\nand kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to\r\nthe house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty\r\nmen of Israel.\r\n\r\n20:32 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before\r\nus, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and\r\ndraw them from the city unto the highways.\r\n\r\n20:33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put\r\nthemselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came\r\nforth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.\r\n\r\n20:34 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all\r\nIsrael, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n20:35 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of\r\nIsrael destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand\r\nand an hundred men: all these drew the sword.\r\n\r\n20:36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the\r\nmen of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto\r\nthe liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.\r\n\r\n20:37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the\r\nliers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the\r\nedge of the sword.\r\n\r\n20:38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and\r\nthe liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise\r\nup out of the city.\r\n\r\n20:39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began\r\nto smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they\r\nsaid, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.\r\n\r\n20:40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a\r\npillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the\r\nflame of the city ascended up to heaven.\r\n\r\n20:41 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin\r\nwere amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.\r\n\r\n20:42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto\r\nthe way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them\r\nwhich came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.\r\n\r\n20:43 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,\r\nand trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the\r\nsunrising.\r\n\r\n20:44 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were\r\nmen of valour.\r\n\r\n20:45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of\r\nRimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men;\r\nand pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n20:46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five\r\nthousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.\r\n\r\n20:47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the\r\nrock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.\r\n\r\n20:48 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of\r\nBenjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men\r\nof every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set\r\non fire all the cities that they came to.\r\n\r\n21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall\r\nnot any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.\r\n\r\n21:2 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till\r\neven before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 21:3 And\r\nsaid, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that\r\nthere should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?  21:4 And it came\r\nto pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an\r\naltar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.\r\n\r\n21:5 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the\r\ntribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?\r\nFor they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the\r\nLORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.\r\n\r\n21:6 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their\r\nbrother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.\r\n\r\n21:7 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have\r\nsworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to\r\nwives?  21:8 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel\r\nthat came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none\r\nto the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.\r\n\r\n21:9 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the\r\ninhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.\r\n\r\n21:10 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the\r\nvaliantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants\r\nof Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n21:11 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy\r\nevery male, and every woman that hath lain by man.\r\n\r\n21:12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four\r\nhundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male:\r\nand they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of\r\nCanaan.\r\n\r\n21:13 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of\r\nBenjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n21:14 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives\r\nwhich they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so\r\nthey sufficed them not.\r\n\r\n21:15 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD\r\nhad made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n21:16 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for\r\nwives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of\r\nBenjamin?  21:17 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them\r\nthat be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n21:18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the\r\nchildren of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife\r\nto Benjamin.\r\n\r\n21:19 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh\r\nyearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east\r\nside of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the\r\nsouth of Lebonah.\r\n\r\n21:20 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go\r\nand lie in wait in the vineyards; 21:21 And see, and, behold, if the\r\ndaughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of\r\nthe vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of\r\nShiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\r\n\r\n21:22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto\r\nus to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them\r\nfor our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the\r\nwar: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\n21:23 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,\r\naccording to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and\r\nthey went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the\r\ncities, and dwelt in them.\r\n\r\n21:24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every\r\nman to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence\r\nevery man to his inheritance.\r\n\r\n21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that\r\nwhich was right in his own eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Ruth\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there\r\nwas a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to\r\nsojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.\r\n\r\n1:2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife\r\nNaomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of\r\nBethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n1:3 And Elimelech Naomi\xe2\x80\x99s husband died; and she was left, and her two\r\nsons.\r\n\r\n1:4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one\r\nwas Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there\r\nabout ten years.\r\n\r\n1:5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was\r\nleft of her two sons and her husband.\r\n\r\n1:6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return\r\nfrom the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how\r\nthat the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.\r\n\r\n1:7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her\r\ntwo daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto\r\nthe land of Judah.\r\n\r\n1:8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt\r\nwith the dead, and with me.\r\n\r\n1:9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house\r\nof her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice,\r\nand wept.\r\n\r\n1:10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n1:11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?\r\nare there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your\r\nhusbands?  1:12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too\r\nold to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have\r\nan husband also to night, and should also bear sons; 1:13 Would ye\r\ntarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from\r\nhaving husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your\r\nsakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.\r\n\r\n1:14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed\r\nher mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.\r\n\r\n1:15 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her\r\npeople, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.\r\n\r\n1:16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from\r\nfollowing after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where\r\nthou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God\r\nmy God: 1:17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:\r\nthe LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and\r\nme.\r\n\r\n1:18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then\r\nshe left speaking unto her.\r\n\r\n1:19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to\r\npass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved\r\nabout them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  1:20 And she said unto\r\nthem, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt\r\nvery bitterly with me.\r\n\r\n1:21 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:\r\nwhy then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me,\r\nand the Almighty hath afflicted me?  1:22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth\r\nthe Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of\r\nthe country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of\r\nbarley harvest.\r\n\r\n2:1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, a mighty man of wealth,\r\nof the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.\r\n\r\n2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the\r\nfield, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nAnd she said unto her, Go, my daughter.\r\n\r\n2:3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the\r\nreapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging\r\nunto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.\r\n\r\n2:4 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,\r\nThe LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.\r\n\r\n2:5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,\r\nWhose damsel is this?  2:6 And the servant that was set over the\r\nreapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back\r\nwith Naomi out of the country of Moab: 2:7 And she said, I pray you,\r\nlet me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she\r\ncame, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she\r\ntarried a little in the house.\r\n\r\n2:8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to\r\nglean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by\r\nmy maidens: 2:9 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and\r\ngo thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall\r\nnot touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and\r\ndrink of that which the young men have drawn.\r\n\r\n2:10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and\r\nsaid unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou\r\nshouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?  2:11 And Boaz\r\nanswered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that\r\nthou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine\r\nhusband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the\r\nland of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest\r\nnot heretofore.\r\n\r\n2:12 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of\r\nthe LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.\r\n\r\n2:13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that\r\nthou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto\r\nthine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.\r\n\r\n2:14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of\r\nthe bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the\r\nreapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was\r\nsufficed, and left.\r\n\r\n2:15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,\r\nsaying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:\r\n2:16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and\r\nleave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.\r\n\r\n2:17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had\r\ngleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.\r\n\r\n2:18 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law\r\nsaw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that\r\nshe had reserved after she was sufficed.\r\n\r\n2:19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to\r\nday?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge\r\nof thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought,\r\nand said, The man\xe2\x80\x99s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.\r\n\r\n2:20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the\r\nLORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the\r\ndead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of\r\nour next kinsmen.\r\n\r\n2:21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt\r\nkeep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.\r\n\r\n2:22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my\r\ndaughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not\r\nin any other field.\r\n\r\n2:23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of\r\nbarley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.\r\n\r\n3:1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I\r\nnot seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?  3:2 And now is\r\nnot Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he\r\nwinnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.\r\n\r\n3:3 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon\r\nthee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto\r\nthe man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n3:4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the\r\nplace where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet,\r\nand lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.\r\n\r\n3:5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.\r\n\r\n3:6 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that\r\nher mother in law bade her.\r\n\r\n3:7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he\r\nwent to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly,\r\nand uncovered his feet, and laid her down.\r\n\r\n3:8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and\r\nturned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.\r\n\r\n3:9 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine\r\nhandmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art\r\na near kinsman.\r\n\r\n3:10 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou\r\nhast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning,\r\ninasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.\r\n\r\n3:11 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou\r\nrequirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a\r\nvirtuous woman.\r\n\r\n3:12 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a\r\nkinsman nearer than I.\r\n\r\n3:13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will\r\nperform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the\r\nkinsman\xe2\x80\x99s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee,\r\nthen will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie\r\ndown until the morning.\r\n\r\n3:14 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before\r\none could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman\r\ncame into the floor.\r\n\r\n3:15 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it\r\non her: and she went into the city.\r\n\r\n3:16 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,\r\nmy daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.\r\n\r\n3:17 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he\r\nsaid to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.\r\n\r\n3:18 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the\r\nmatter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have\r\nfinished the thing this day.\r\n\r\n4:1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,\r\nbehold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho,\r\nsuch a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye\r\ndown here. And they sat down.\r\n\r\n4:3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the\r\ncountry of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother\r\nElimelech\xe2\x80\x99s: 4:4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it\r\nbefore the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou\r\nwilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell\r\nme, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I\r\nam after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.\r\n\r\n4:5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of\r\nNaomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the\r\ndead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.\r\n\r\n4:6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar\r\nmine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot\r\nredeem it.\r\n\r\n4:7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning\r\nredeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man\r\nplucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a\r\ntestimony in Israel.\r\n\r\n4:8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew\r\noff his shoe.\r\n\r\n4:9 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are\r\nwitnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nall that was Chilion\xe2\x80\x99s and Mahlon\xe2\x80\x99s, of the hand of Naomi.\r\n\r\n4:10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased\r\nto be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,\r\nthat the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and\r\nfrom the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.\r\n\r\n4:11 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,\r\nWe are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine\r\nhouse like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of\r\nIsrael: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:\r\n4:12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare\r\nunto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto\r\nher, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.\r\n\r\n4:14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath\r\nnot left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous\r\nin Israel.\r\n\r\n4:15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher\r\nof thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is\r\nbetter to thee than seven sons, hath born him.\r\n\r\n4:16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became\r\nnurse unto it.\r\n\r\n4:17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a\r\nson born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of\r\nJesse, the father of David.\r\n\r\n4:18 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,\r\n4:19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 4:20 And Amminadab\r\nbegat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 4:21 And Salmon begat Boaz,\r\nand Boaz begat Obed, 4:22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Book of Samuel\r\n\r\nOtherwise Called:\r\n\r\nThe First Book of the Kings\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,\r\nand his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the\r\nson of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 1:2 And he had two wives;\r\nthe name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah:\r\nand Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.\r\n\r\n1:3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to\r\nsacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,\r\nHophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.\r\n\r\n1:4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah\r\nhis wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 1:5 But\r\nunto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the\r\nLORD had shut up her womb.\r\n\r\n1:6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,\r\nbecause the LORD had shut up her womb.\r\n\r\n1:7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of\r\nthe LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.\r\n\r\n1:8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?\r\nand why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better\r\nto thee than ten sons?  1:9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in\r\nShiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat\r\nby a post of the temple of the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and\r\nwept sore.\r\n\r\n1:11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt\r\nindeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and\r\nnot forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man\r\nchild, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life,\r\nand there shall no razor come upon his head.\r\n\r\n1:12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,\r\nthat Eli marked her mouth.\r\n\r\n1:13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her\r\nvoice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.\r\n\r\n1:14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away\r\nthy wine from thee.\r\n\r\n1:15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a\r\nsorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have\r\npoured out my soul before the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the\r\nabundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.\r\n\r\n1:17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel\r\ngrant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.\r\n\r\n1:18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the\r\nwoman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.\r\n\r\n1:19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the\r\nLORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew\r\nHannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.\r\n\r\n1:20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after\r\nHannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,\r\nsaying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the\r\nLORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.\r\n\r\n1:22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not\r\ngo up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he\r\nmay appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.\r\n\r\n1:23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;\r\ntarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So\r\nthe woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.\r\n\r\n1:24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three\r\nbullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought\r\nhim unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.\r\n\r\n1:25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.\r\n\r\n1:26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the\r\nwoman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition\r\nwhich I asked of him: 1:28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD;\r\nas long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped\r\nthe LORD there.\r\n\r\n2:1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine\r\nhorn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;\r\nbecause I rejoice in thy salvation.\r\n\r\n2:2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:\r\nneither is there any rock like our God.\r\n\r\n2:3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of\r\nyour mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n2:4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are\r\ngirded with strength.\r\n\r\n2:5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they\r\nthat were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she\r\nthat hath many children is waxed feeble.\r\n\r\n2:6 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave,\r\nand bringeth up.\r\n\r\n2:7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and\r\nlifteth up.\r\n\r\n2:8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar\r\nfrom the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit\r\nthe throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nhe hath set the world upon them.\r\n\r\n2:9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be\r\nsilent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.\r\n\r\n2:10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of\r\nheaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of\r\nthe earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the\r\nhorn of his anointed.\r\n\r\n2:11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did\r\nminister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.\r\n\r\n2:12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:13 And the priest\xe2\x80\x99s custom with the people was, that, when any man\r\noffered sacrifice, the priest\xe2\x80\x99s servant came, while the flesh was in\r\nseething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 2:14 And he\r\nstruck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the\r\nfleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in\r\nShiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.\r\n\r\n2:15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest\xe2\x80\x99s servant came, and\r\nsaid to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;\r\nfor he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.\r\n\r\n2:16 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat\r\npresently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would\r\nanswer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will\r\ntake it by force.\r\n\r\n2:17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the\r\nLORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:18 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with\r\na linen ephod.\r\n\r\n2:19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him\r\nfrom year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the\r\nyearly sacrifice.\r\n\r\n2:20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give\r\nthee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And\r\nthey went unto their own home.\r\n\r\n2:21 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare\r\nthree sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n2:22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all\r\nIsrael; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\n2:23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your\r\nevil dealings by all this people.\r\n\r\n2:24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s people to transgress.\r\n\r\n2:25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if\r\na man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding\r\nthey hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD\r\nwould slay them.\r\n\r\n2:26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the\r\nLORD, and also with men.\r\n\r\n2:27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,\r\nwhen they were in Egypt in Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s house?  2:28 And did I choose him\r\nout of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine\r\naltar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give\r\nunto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the\r\nchildren of Israel?  2:29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at\r\nmine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest\r\nthy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the\r\nofferings of Israel my people?  2:30 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel\r\nsaith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father,\r\nshould walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from\r\nme; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me\r\nshall be lightly esteemed.\r\n\r\n2:31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm\r\nof thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n2:32 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth\r\nwhich God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in\r\nthine house for ever.\r\n\r\n2:33 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,\r\nshall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the\r\nincrease of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.\r\n\r\n2:34 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two\r\nsons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.\r\n\r\n2:35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according\r\nto that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a\r\nsure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.\r\n\r\n2:36 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine\r\nhouse shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel\r\nof bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests\xe2\x80\x99\r\noffices, that I may eat a piece of bread.\r\n\r\n3:1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the\r\nword of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.\r\n\r\n3:2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his\r\nplace, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; 3:3 And\r\nere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark\r\nof God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; 3:4 That the LORD\r\ncalled Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.\r\n\r\n3:5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.\r\nAnd he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.\r\n\r\n3:6 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went\r\nto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered,\r\nI called not, my son; lie down again.\r\n\r\n3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the\r\nLORD yet revealed unto him.\r\n\r\n3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and\r\nwent to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli\r\nperceived that the LORD had called the child.\r\n\r\n3:9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if\r\nhe call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant\r\nheareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\r\n\r\n3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,\r\nSamuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.\r\n\r\n3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,\r\nat which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.\r\n\r\n3:12 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have\r\nspoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.\r\n\r\n3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the\r\niniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and\r\nhe restrained them not.\r\n\r\n3:14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the\r\niniquity of Eli\xe2\x80\x99s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor\r\noffering for ever.\r\n\r\n3:15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the\r\nhouse of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.\r\n\r\n3:16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he\r\nanswered, Here am I.\r\n\r\n3:17 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?\r\nI pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if\r\nthou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.\r\n\r\n3:18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he\r\nsaid, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.\r\n\r\n3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of\r\nhis words fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was\r\nestablished to be a prophet of the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed\r\nhimself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out\r\nagainst the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and\r\nthe Philistines pitched in Aphek.\r\n\r\n4:2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and\r\nwhen they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines:\r\nand they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\r\n\r\n4:3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel\r\nsaid, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the\r\nPhilistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of\r\nShiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of\r\nthe hand of our enemies.\r\n\r\n4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence\r\nthe ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between\r\nthe cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were\r\nthere with the ark of the covenant of God.\r\n\r\n4:5 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,\r\nall Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\r\n\r\n4:6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,\r\nWhat meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?\r\nAnd they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.\r\n\r\n4:7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into\r\nthe camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a\r\nthing heretofore.\r\n\r\n4:8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty\r\nGods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues\r\nin the wilderness.\r\n\r\n4:9 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye\r\nbe not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit\r\nyourselves like men, and fight.\r\n\r\n4:10 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled\r\nevery man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for\r\nthere fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.\r\n\r\n4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and\r\nPhinehas, were slain.\r\n\r\n4:12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to\r\nShiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n4:13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside\r\nwatching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man\r\ncame into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.\r\n\r\n4:14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth\r\nthe noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.\r\n\r\n4:15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,\r\nthat he could not see.\r\n\r\n4:16 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and\r\nI fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my\r\nson?  4:17 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before\r\nthe Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the\r\npeople, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the\r\nark of God is taken.\r\n\r\n4:18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that\r\nhe fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his\r\nneck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had\r\njudged Israel forty years.\r\n\r\n4:19 And his daughter in law, Phinehas\xe2\x80\x99 wife, was with child, near to\r\nbe delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was\r\ntaken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed\r\nherself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.\r\n\r\n4:20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said\r\nunto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not,\r\nneither did she regard it.\r\n\r\n4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed\r\nfrom Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her\r\nfather in law and her husband.\r\n\r\n4:22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of\r\nGod is taken.\r\n\r\n5:1 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from\r\nEbenezer unto Ashdod.\r\n\r\n5:2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the\r\nhouse of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.\r\n\r\n5:3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon\r\nwas fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And\r\nthey took Dagon, and set him in his place again.\r\n\r\n5:4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was\r\nfallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the\r\nhead of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the\r\nthreshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.\r\n\r\n5:5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into\r\nDagon\xe2\x80\x99s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n5:6 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he\r\ndestroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the\r\ncoasts thereof.\r\n\r\n5:7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark\r\nof the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore\r\nupon us, and upon Dagon our god.\r\n\r\n5:8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines\r\nunto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of\r\nIsrael? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried\r\nabout unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about\r\nthither.\r\n\r\n5:9 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of\r\nthe LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he\r\nsmote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods\r\nin their secret parts.\r\n\r\n5:10 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,\r\nas the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,\r\nThey have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us\r\nand our people.\r\n\r\n5:11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the\r\nPhilistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let\r\nit go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for\r\nthere was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of\r\nGod was very heavy there.\r\n\r\n5:12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the\r\ncry of the city went up to heaven.\r\n\r\n6:1 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines\r\nseven months.\r\n\r\n6:2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,\r\nsaying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we\r\nshall send it to his place.\r\n\r\n6:3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send\r\nit not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye\r\nshall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not\r\nremoved from you.\r\n\r\n6:4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall\r\nreturn to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden\r\nmice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one\r\nplague was on you all, and on your lords.\r\n\r\n6:5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your\r\nmice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of\r\nIsrael: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from\r\noff your gods, and from off your land.\r\n\r\n6:6 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and\r\nPharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among\r\nthem, did they not let the people go, and they departed?  6:7 Now\r\ntherefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there\r\nhath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their\r\ncalves home from them: 6:8 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it\r\nupon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a\r\ntrespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,\r\nthat it may go.\r\n\r\n6:9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to\r\nBethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we\r\nshall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that\r\nhappened to us.\r\n\r\n6:10 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the\r\ncart, and shut up their calves at home: 6:11 And they laid the ark of\r\nthe LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the\r\nimages of their emerods.\r\n\r\n6:12 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and\r\nwent along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to\r\nthe right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went\r\nafter them unto the border of Bethshemesh.\r\n\r\n6:13 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the\r\nvalley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced\r\nto see it.\r\n\r\n6:14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and\r\nstood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of\r\nthe cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer\r\nthat was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the\r\ngreat stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and\r\nsacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they\r\nreturned to Ekron the same day.\r\n\r\n6:17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned\r\nfor a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,\r\nfor Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 6:18 And the golden\r\nmice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines\r\nbelonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country\r\nvillages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the\r\nark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of\r\nJoshua, the Bethshemite.\r\n\r\n6:19 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into\r\nthe ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and\r\nthreescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had\r\nsmitten many of the people with a great slaughter.\r\n\r\n6:20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this\r\nholy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?  6:21 And they sent\r\nmessengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The\r\nPhilistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and\r\nfetch it up to you.\r\n\r\n7:1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the\r\nLORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and\r\nsanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that\r\nthe time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of\r\nIsrael lamented after the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do\r\nreturn unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange\r\ngods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the\r\nLORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of\r\nthe Philistines.\r\n\r\n7:4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and\r\nserved the LORD only.\r\n\r\n7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for\r\nyou unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured\r\nit out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We\r\nhave sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel\r\nin Mizpeh.\r\n\r\n7:7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were\r\ngathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up\r\nagainst Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were\r\nafraid of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n7:8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto\r\nthe LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n7:9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt\r\noffering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for\r\nIsrael; and the LORD heard him.\r\n\r\n7:10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines\r\ndrew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a\r\ngreat thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them;\r\nand they were smitten before Israel.\r\n\r\n7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the\r\nPhilistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.\r\n\r\n7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and\r\ncalled the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped\r\nus.\r\n\r\n7:13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the\r\ncoast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines\r\nall the days of Samuel.\r\n\r\n7:14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were\r\nrestored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof\r\ndid Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was\r\npeace between Israel and the Amorites.\r\n\r\n7:15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.\r\n\r\n7:16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,\r\nand Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.\r\n\r\n7:17 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there\r\nhe judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons\r\njudges over Israel.\r\n\r\n8:2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his\r\nsecond, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.\r\n\r\n8:3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,\r\nand took bribes, and perverted judgment.\r\n\r\n8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and\r\ncame to Samuel unto Ramah, 8:5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art\r\nold, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us\r\nlike all the nations.\r\n\r\n8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to\r\njudge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the\r\npeople in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected\r\nthee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.\r\n\r\n8:8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that\r\nI brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have\r\nforsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.\r\n\r\n8:9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest\r\nsolemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall\r\nreign over them.\r\n\r\n8:10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that\r\nasked of him a king.\r\n\r\n8:11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign\r\nover you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for\r\nhis chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his\r\nchariots.\r\n\r\n8:12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains\r\nover fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his\r\nharvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his\r\nchariots.\r\n\r\n8:13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be\r\ncooks, and to be bakers.\r\n\r\n8:14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your\r\noliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.\r\n\r\n8:15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,\r\nand give to his officers, and to his servants.\r\n\r\n8:16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and\r\nyour goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.\r\n\r\n8:17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n8:18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye\r\nshall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.\r\n\r\n8:19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and\r\nthey said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 8:20 That we also may\r\nbe like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out\r\nbefore us, and fight our battles.\r\n\r\n8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed\r\nthem in the ears of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make\r\nthem a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man\r\nunto his city.\r\n\r\n9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of\r\nAbiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a\r\nBenjamite, a mighty man of power.\r\n\r\n9:2 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a\r\ngoodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier\r\nperson than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n9:3 And the asses of Kish Saul\xe2\x80\x99s father were lost. And Kish said to\r\nSaul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go\r\nseek the asses.\r\n\r\n9:4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land\r\nof Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the\r\nland of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the\r\nland of the Benjamites, but they found them not.\r\n\r\n9:5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his\r\nservant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father\r\nleave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.\r\n\r\n9:6 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of\r\nGod, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to\r\npass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that\r\nwe should go.\r\n\r\n9:7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall\r\nwe bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is\r\nnot a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?  9:8 And the\r\nservant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the\r\nfourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God,\r\nto tell us our way.\r\n\r\n9:9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he\r\nspake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a\r\nProphet was beforetime called a Seer.)  9:10 Then said Saul to his\r\nservant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where\r\nthe man of God was.\r\n\r\n9:11 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young\r\nmaidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?\r\n9:12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before\r\nyou: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a\r\nsacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 9:13 As soon as ye\r\nbe come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up\r\nto the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come,\r\nbecause he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be\r\nbidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n9:14 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the\r\ncity, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n9:15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,\r\nsaying, 9:16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of\r\nthe land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my\r\npeople Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the\r\nPhilistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is\r\ncome unto me.\r\n\r\n9:17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man\r\nwhom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.\r\n\r\n9:18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I\r\npray thee, where the seer\xe2\x80\x99s house is.\r\n\r\n9:19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before\r\nme unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow\r\nI will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.\r\n\r\n9:20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy\r\nmind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of\r\nIsrael? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house?  9:21 And\r\nSaul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the\r\ntribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the\r\ntribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?  9:22 And\r\nSamuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour,\r\nand made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden,\r\nwhich were about thirty persons.\r\n\r\n9:23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave\r\nthee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.\r\n\r\n9:24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,\r\nand set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!\r\nset it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for\r\nthee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with\r\nSamuel that day.\r\n\r\n9:25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city,\r\nSamuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.\r\n\r\n9:26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the\r\nday, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that\r\nI may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,\r\nhe and Samuel, abroad.\r\n\r\n9:27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said\r\nto Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but\r\nstand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.\r\n\r\n10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and\r\nkissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to\r\nbe captain over his inheritance?  10:2 When thou art departed from me\r\nto day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s sepulchre in the\r\nborder of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses\r\nwhich thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left\r\nthe care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do\r\nfor my son?  10:3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou\r\nshalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men\r\ngoing up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another\r\ncarrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:\r\n10:4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;\r\nwhich thou shalt receive of their hands.\r\n\r\n10:5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the\r\ngarrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art\r\ncome thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets\r\ncoming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a\r\npipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 10:6 And the\r\nSpirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with\r\nthem, and shalt be turned into another man.\r\n\r\n10:7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do\r\nas occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.\r\n\r\n10:8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will\r\ncome down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice\r\nsacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I\r\ncome to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.\r\n\r\n10:9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from\r\nSamuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n10:10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of\r\nprophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he\r\nprophesied among them.\r\n\r\n10:11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,\r\nbehold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to\r\nanother, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also\r\namong the prophets?  10:12 And one of the same place answered and\r\nsaid, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul\r\nalso among the prophets?  10:13 And when he had made an end of\r\nprophesying, he came to the high place.\r\n\r\n10:14 And Saul\xe2\x80\x99s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went\r\nye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no\r\nwhere, we came to Samuel.\r\n\r\n10:15 And Saul\xe2\x80\x99s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said\r\nunto you.\r\n\r\n10:16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses\r\nwere found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he\r\ntold him not.\r\n\r\n10:17 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;\r\n10:18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of\r\nIsrael, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the\r\nhand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of\r\nthem that oppressed you: 10:19 And ye have this day rejected your God,\r\nwho himself saved you out of all your adversities and your\r\ntribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.\r\nNow therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and\r\nby your thousands.\r\n\r\n10:20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come\r\nnear, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.\r\n\r\n10:21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their\r\nfamilies, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was\r\ntaken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.\r\n\r\n10:22 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should\r\nyet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself\r\namong the stuff.\r\n\r\n10:23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the\r\npeople, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and\r\nupward.\r\n\r\n10:24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath\r\nchosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the\r\npeople shouted, and said, God save the king.\r\n\r\n10:25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote\r\nit in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the\r\npeople away, every man to his house.\r\n\r\n10:26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a\r\nband of men, whose hearts God had touched.\r\n\r\n10:27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And\r\nthey despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.\r\n\r\n11:1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against\r\nJabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a\r\ncovenant with us, and we will serve thee.\r\n\r\n11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I\r\nmake a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes,\r\nand lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.\r\n\r\n11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrespite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel:\r\nand then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.\r\n\r\n11:4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings\r\nin the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices,\r\nand wept.\r\n\r\n11:5 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul\r\nsaid, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the\r\ntidings of the men of Jabesh.\r\n\r\n11:6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,\r\nand his anger was kindled greatly.\r\n\r\n11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent\r\nthem throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers,\r\nsaying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so\r\nshall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the\r\npeople, and they came out with one consent.\r\n\r\n11:8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were\r\nthree hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.\r\n\r\n11:9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say\r\nunto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot,\r\nye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men\r\nof Jabesh; and they were glad.\r\n\r\n11:10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out\r\nunto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.\r\n\r\n11:11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three\r\ncompanies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning\r\nwatch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came\r\nto pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them\r\nwere not left together.\r\n\r\n11:12 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul\r\nreign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.\r\n\r\n11:13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:\r\nfor to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.\r\n\r\n11:14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,\r\nand renew the kingdom there.\r\n\r\n11:15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king\r\nbefore the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of\r\npeace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of\r\nIsrael rejoiced greatly.\r\n\r\n12:1 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto\r\nyour voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.\r\n\r\n12:2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and\r\ngrayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked\r\nbefore you from my childhood unto this day.\r\n\r\n12:3 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before\r\nhis anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or\r\nwhom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I\r\nreceived any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n12:4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,\r\nneither hast thou taken ought of any man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n12:5 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his\r\nanointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.\r\nAnd they answered, He is witness.\r\n\r\n12:6 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced\r\nMoses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n12:7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the\r\nLORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to\r\nyour fathers.\r\n\r\n12:8 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the\r\nLORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your\r\nfathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.\r\n\r\n12:9 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the\r\nhand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the\r\nPhilistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n12:10 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because\r\nwe have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but\r\nnow deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.\r\n\r\n12:11 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and\r\nSamuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every\r\nside, and ye dwelled safe.\r\n\r\n12:12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon\r\ncame against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over\r\nus: when the LORD your God was your king.\r\n\r\n12:13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye\r\nhave desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.\r\n\r\n12:14 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and\r\nnot rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and\r\nalso the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your\r\nGod: 12:15 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel\r\nagainst the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD\r\nbe against you, as it was against your fathers.\r\n\r\n12:16 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD\r\nwill do before your eyes.\r\n\r\n12:17 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and\r\nhe shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your\r\nwickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in\r\nasking you a king.\r\n\r\n12:18 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and\r\nrain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.\r\n\r\n12:19 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto\r\nthe LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins\r\nthis evil, to ask us a king.\r\n\r\n12:20 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this\r\nwickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the\r\nLORD with all your heart; 12:21 And turn ye not aside: for then should\r\nye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n12:22 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.\r\n\r\n12:23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the\r\nLORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the\r\nright way: 12:24 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all\r\nyour heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.\r\n\r\n12:25 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye\r\nand your king.\r\n\r\n13:1 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over\r\nIsrael, 13:2 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two\r\nthousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a\r\nthousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the\r\npeople he sent every man to his tent.\r\n\r\n13:3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in\r\nGeba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet\r\nthroughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.\r\n\r\n13:4 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the\r\nPhilistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the\r\nPhilistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.\r\n\r\n13:5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with\r\nIsrael, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and\r\npeople as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they\r\ncame up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.\r\n\r\n13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the\r\npeople were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,\r\nand in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.\r\n\r\n13:7 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and\r\nGilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed\r\nhim trembling.\r\n\r\n13:8 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel\r\nhad appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were\r\nscattered from him.\r\n\r\n13:9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace\r\nofferings. And he offered the burnt offering.\r\n\r\n13:10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of\r\noffering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to\r\nmeet him, that he might salute him.\r\n\r\n13:11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I\r\nsaw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not\r\nwithin the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered\r\nthemselves together at Michmash; 13:12 Therefore said I, The\r\nPhilistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made\r\nsupplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a\r\nburnt offering.\r\n\r\n13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not\r\nkept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for\r\nnow would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.\r\n\r\n13:14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him\r\na man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be\r\ncaptain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the\r\nLORD commanded thee.\r\n\r\n13:15 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of\r\nBenjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him,\r\nabout six hundred men.\r\n\r\n13:16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present\r\nwith them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped\r\nin Michmash.\r\n\r\n13:17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in\r\nthree companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to\r\nOphrah, unto the land of Shual: 13:18 And another company turned the\r\nway to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border\r\nthat looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.\r\n\r\n13:19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:\r\nfor the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:\r\n13:20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen\r\nevery man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.\r\n\r\n13:21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and\r\nfor the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.\r\n\r\n13:22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither\r\nsword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with\r\nSaul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of\r\nMichmash.\r\n\r\n14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul\r\nsaid unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over\r\nto the Philistines\xe2\x80\x99 garrison, that is on the other side. But he told\r\nnot his father.\r\n\r\n14:2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a\r\npomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him\r\nwere about six hundred men; 14:3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,\r\nIchabod\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npriest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that\r\nJonathan was gone.\r\n\r\n14:4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over\r\nunto the Philistines\xe2\x80\x99 garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one\r\nside, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was\r\nBozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\r\n\r\n14:5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against\r\nMichmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.\r\n\r\n14:6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,\r\nand let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be\r\nthat the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD\r\nto save by many or by few.\r\n\r\n14:7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine\r\nheart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.\r\n\r\n14:8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and\r\nwe will discover ourselves unto them.\r\n\r\n14:9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we\r\nwill stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.\r\n\r\n14:10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for\r\nthe LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign\r\nunto us.\r\n\r\n14:11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the\r\nPhilistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth\r\nout of the holes where they had hid themselves.\r\n\r\n14:12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his\r\narmourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.\r\nAnd Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the\r\nLORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and\r\nhis armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his\r\narmourbearer slew after him.\r\n\r\n14:14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer\r\nmade, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,\r\nwhich a yoke of oxen might plow.\r\n\r\n14:15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all\r\nthe people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and\r\nthe earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.\r\n\r\n14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,\r\nbehold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n14:17 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,\r\nand see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold,\r\nJonathan and his armourbearer were not there.\r\n\r\n14:18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the\r\nark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the\r\nnoise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased:\r\nand Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.\r\n\r\n14:20 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled\r\nthemselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.\r\n\r\n14:21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that\r\ntime, which went up with them into the camp from the country round\r\nabout, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with\r\nSaul and Jonathan.\r\n\r\n14:22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount\r\nEphraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also\r\nfollowed hard after them in the battle.\r\n\r\n14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over\r\nunto Bethaven.\r\n\r\n14:24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had\r\nadjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food\r\nuntil evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the\r\npeople tasted any food.\r\n\r\n14:25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n14:26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey\r\ndropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared\r\nthe oath.\r\n\r\n14:27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with\r\nthe oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his\r\nhand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth;\r\nand his eyes were enlightened.\r\n\r\n14:28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly\r\ncharged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth\r\nany food this day. And the people were faint.\r\n\r\n14:29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I\r\npray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a\r\nlittle of this honey.\r\n\r\n14:30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of\r\nthe spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been\r\nnow a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?  14:31 And they\r\nsmote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the\r\npeople were very faint.\r\n\r\n14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,\r\nand calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them\r\nwith the blood.\r\n\r\n14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the\r\nLORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have\r\ntransgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.\r\n\r\n14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say\r\nunto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,\r\nand slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating\r\nwith the blood.\r\n\r\nAnd all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and\r\nslew them there.\r\n\r\n14:35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first\r\naltar that he built unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,\r\nand spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of\r\nthem. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said\r\nthe priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.\r\n\r\n14:37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the\r\nPhilistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he\r\nanswered him not that day.\r\n\r\n14:38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:\r\nand know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.\r\n\r\n14:39 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in\r\nJonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among\r\nall the people that answered him.\r\n\r\n14:40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and\r\nJonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto\r\nSaul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.\r\n\r\n14:41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nAnd Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.\r\n\r\n14:42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And\r\nJonathan was taken.\r\n\r\n14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And\r\nJonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the\r\nend of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.\r\n\r\n14:44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt\r\nsurely die, Jonathan.\r\n\r\n14:45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath\r\nwrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD\r\nliveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for\r\nhe hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan,\r\nthat he died not.\r\n\r\n14:46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the\r\nPhilistines went to their own place.\r\n\r\n14:47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his\r\nenemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of\r\nAmmon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against\r\nthe Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.\r\n\r\n14:48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered\r\nIsrael out of the hands of them that spoiled them.\r\n\r\n14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:\r\nand the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the\r\nfirstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 14:50 And the\r\nname of Saul\xe2\x80\x99s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name\r\nof the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul\xe2\x80\x99s uncle.\r\n\r\n14:51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was\r\nthe son of Abiel.\r\n\r\n14:52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of\r\nSaul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took\r\nhim unto him.\r\n\r\n15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be\r\nking over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the\r\nvoice of the words of the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to\r\nIsrael, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,\r\nand spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,\r\nox and sheep, camel and ass.\r\n\r\n15:4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in\r\nTelaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\r\n\r\n15:5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\r\n\r\n15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from\r\namong the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed\r\nkindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of\r\nEgypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\r\n\r\n15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to\r\nShur, that is over against Egypt.\r\n\r\n15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly\r\ndestroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.\r\n\r\n15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,\r\nand of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was\r\ngood, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was\r\nvile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.\r\n\r\n15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 15:11 It\r\nrepenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back\r\nfrom following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it\r\ngrieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.\r\n\r\n15:12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was\r\ntold Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a\r\nplace, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.\r\n\r\n15:13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou\r\nof the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in\r\nmine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  15:15 And Saul\r\nsaid, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people\r\nspared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the\r\nLORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n15:16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the\r\nLORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.\r\n\r\n15:17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast\r\nthou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed\r\nthee king over Israel?  15:18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and\r\nsaid, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight\r\nagainst them until they be consumed.\r\n\r\n15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but\r\ndidst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?\r\n15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the\r\nLORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought\r\nAgag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.\r\n\r\n15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of\r\nthe things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto\r\nthe LORD thy God in Gilgal.\r\n\r\n15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt\r\nofferings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold,\r\nto obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\r\n\r\n15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is\r\nas iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the\r\nLORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.\r\n\r\n15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have\r\ntransgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I\r\nfeared the people, and obeyed their voice.\r\n\r\n15:25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with\r\nme, that I may worship the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou\r\nhast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee\r\nfrom being king over Israel.\r\n\r\n15:27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the\r\nskirt of his mantle, and it rent.\r\n\r\n15:28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of\r\nIsrael from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,\r\nthat is better than thou.\r\n\r\n15:29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he\r\nis not a man, that he should repent.\r\n\r\n15:30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,\r\nbefore the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with\r\nme, that I may worship the LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n15:31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the\r\nAmalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely\r\nthe bitterness of death is past.\r\n\r\n15:33 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so\r\nshall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in\r\npieces before the LORD in Gilgal.\r\n\r\n15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to\r\nGibeah of Saul.\r\n\r\n15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:\r\nnevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he\r\nhad made Saul king over Israel.\r\n\r\n16:1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,\r\nseeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn\r\nwith oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I\r\nhave provided me a king among his sons.\r\n\r\n16:2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.\r\nAnd the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to\r\nsacrifice to the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou\r\nshalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.\r\n\r\n16:4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.\r\nAnd the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest\r\nthou peaceably?  16:5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice\r\nunto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.\r\nAnd he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n16:6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on\r\nEliab, and said, Surely the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed is before him.\r\n\r\n16:7 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on\r\nthe height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD\r\nseeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but\r\nthe LORD looketh on the heart.\r\n\r\n16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And\r\nhe said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.\r\n\r\n16:9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the\r\nLORD chosen this.\r\n\r\n16:10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And\r\nSamuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.\r\n\r\n16:11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he\r\nsaid, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the\r\nsheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not\r\nsit down till he come hither.\r\n\r\n16:12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of\r\na beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said,\r\nArise, anoint him: for this is he.\r\n\r\n16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst\r\nof his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that\r\nday forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.\r\n\r\n16:14 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil\r\nspirit from the LORD troubled him.\r\n\r\n16:15 And Saul\xe2\x80\x99s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit\r\nfrom God troubleth thee.\r\n\r\n16:16 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to\r\nseek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come\r\nto pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall\r\nplay with his hand, and thou shalt be well.\r\n\r\n16:17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can\r\nplay well, and bring him to me.\r\n\r\n16:18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen\r\na son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a\r\nmighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a\r\ncomely person, and the LORD is with him.\r\n\r\n16:19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me\r\nDavid thy son, which is with the sheep.\r\n\r\n16:20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,\r\nand a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.\r\n\r\n16:21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him\r\ngreatly; and he became his armourbearer.\r\n\r\n16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand\r\nbefore me; for he hath found favour in my sight.\r\n\r\n16:23 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon\r\nSaul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was\r\nrefreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.\r\n\r\n17:1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and\r\nwere gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and\r\npitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.\r\n\r\n17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and\r\npitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n17:3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and\r\nIsrael stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n17:4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,\r\nnamed Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.\r\n\r\n17:5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed\r\nwith a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand\r\nshekels of brass.\r\n\r\n17:6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass\r\nbetween his shoulders.\r\n\r\n17:7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s beam; and his\r\nspear\xe2\x80\x99s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a\r\nshield went before him.\r\n\r\n17:8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto\r\nthem, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a\r\nPhilistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let\r\nhim come down to me.\r\n\r\n17:9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be\r\nyour servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall\r\nye be our servants, and serve us.\r\n\r\n17:10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;\r\ngive me a man, that we may fight together.\r\n\r\n17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,\r\nthey were dismayed, and greatly afraid.\r\n\r\n17:12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,\r\nwhose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among\r\nmen for an old man in the days of Saul.\r\n\r\n17:13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the\r\nbattle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were\r\nEliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third\r\nShammah.\r\n\r\n17:14 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.\r\n\r\n17:15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father\xe2\x80\x99s sheep\r\nat Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n17:16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented\r\nhimself forty days.\r\n\r\n17:17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an\r\nephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp\r\nof thy brethren; 17:18 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of\r\ntheir thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.\r\n\r\n17:19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the\r\nvalley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\r\n\r\n17:20 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with\r\na keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came\r\nto the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted\r\nfor the battle.\r\n\r\n17:21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army\r\nagainst army.\r\n\r\n17:22 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the\r\ncarriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.\r\n\r\n17:23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,\r\nthe Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the\r\nPhilistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n17:24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,\r\nand were sore afraid.\r\n\r\n17:25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come\r\nup?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the\r\nman who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and\r\nwill give him his daughter, and make his father\xe2\x80\x99s house free in\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n17:26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall\r\nbe done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the\r\nreproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that\r\nhe should defy the armies of the living God?  17:27 And the people\r\nanswered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man\r\nthat killeth him.\r\n\r\n17:28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;\r\nand Eliab\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest\r\nthou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the\r\nwilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for\r\nthou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.\r\n\r\n17:29 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?\r\n17:30 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same\r\nmanner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.\r\n\r\n17:31 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed\r\nthem before Saul: and he sent for him.\r\n\r\n17:32 And David said to Saul, Let no man\xe2\x80\x99s heart fail because of him;\r\nthy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\r\n\r\n17:33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this\r\nPhilistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man\r\nof war from his youth.\r\n\r\n17:34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father\xe2\x80\x99s sheep,\r\nand there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:\r\n17:35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of\r\nhis mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard,\r\nand smote him, and slew him.\r\n\r\n17:36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this\r\nuncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath\r\ndefied the armies of the living God.\r\n\r\n17:37 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw\r\nof the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of\r\nthe hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the\r\nLORD be with thee.\r\n\r\n17:38 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of\r\nbrass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.\r\n\r\n17:39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to\r\ngo; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go\r\nwith these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.\r\n\r\n17:40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth\r\nstones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s bag which he\r\nhad, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near\r\nto the Philistine.\r\n\r\n17:41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man\r\nthat bare the shield went before him.\r\n\r\n17:42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he\r\ndisdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n17:43 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest\r\nto me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\r\n\r\n17:44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give\r\nthy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.\r\n\r\n17:45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a\r\nsword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the\r\nname of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou\r\nhast defied.\r\n\r\n17:46 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will\r\nsmite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the\r\ncarcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the\r\nair, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know\r\nthat there is a God in Israel.\r\n\r\n17:47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with\r\nsword and spear: for the battle is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s, and he will give you\r\ninto our hands.\r\n\r\n17:48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and\r\ndrew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army\r\nto meet the Philistine.\r\n\r\n17:49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and\r\nslang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone\r\nsunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.\r\n\r\n17:50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a\r\nstone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword\r\nin the hand of David.\r\n\r\n17:51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his\r\nsword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut\r\noff his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion\r\nwas dead, they fled.\r\n\r\n17:52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and\r\npursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the\r\ngates of Ekron.\r\n\r\nAnd the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,\r\neven unto Gath, and unto Ekron.\r\n\r\n17:53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the\r\nPhilistines, and they spoiled their tents.\r\n\r\n17:54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to\r\nJerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.\r\n\r\n17:55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said\r\nunto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?\r\nAnd Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.\r\n\r\n17:56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.\r\n\r\n17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,\r\nAbner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the\r\nPhilistine in his hand.\r\n\r\n17:58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And\r\nDavid answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\r\n\r\n18:1 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto\r\nSaul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and\r\nJonathan loved him as his own soul.\r\n\r\n18:2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n18:3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as\r\nhis own soul.\r\n\r\n18:4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and\r\ngave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow,\r\nand to his girdle.\r\n\r\n18:5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved\r\nhimself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was\r\naccepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of\r\nSaul\xe2\x80\x99s servants.\r\n\r\n18:6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from\r\nthe slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities\r\nof Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with\r\njoy, and with instruments of musick.\r\n\r\n18:7 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul\r\nhath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\r\n\r\n18:8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he\r\nsaid, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have\r\nascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?\r\n18:9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.\r\n\r\n18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God\r\ncame upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David\r\nplayed with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in\r\nSaul\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n18:11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even\r\nto the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.\r\n\r\n18:12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and\r\nwas departed from Saul.\r\n\r\n18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain\r\nover a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\r\n\r\n18:14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD\r\nwas with him.\r\n\r\n18:15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he\r\nwas afraid of him.\r\n\r\n18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and\r\ncame in before them.\r\n\r\n18:17 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will\r\nI give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbattles.\r\n\r\nFor Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the\r\nPhilistines be upon him.\r\n\r\n18:18 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?\r\n18:19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nshould have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the\r\nMeholathite to wife.\r\n\r\n18:20 And Michal Saul\xe2\x80\x99s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and\r\nthe thing pleased him.\r\n\r\n18:21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to\r\nhim, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\r\nWherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in\r\nthe one of the twain.\r\n\r\n18:22 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David\r\nsecretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his\r\nservants love thee: now therefore be the king\xe2\x80\x99s son in law.\r\n\r\n18:23 And Saul\xe2\x80\x99s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And\r\nDavid said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king\xe2\x80\x99s son in law,\r\nseeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?  18:24 And the\r\nservants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.\r\n\r\n18:25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not\r\nany dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged\r\nof the king\xe2\x80\x99s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand\r\nof the Philistines.\r\n\r\n18:26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David\r\nwell to be the king\xe2\x80\x99s son in law: and the days were not expired.\r\n\r\n18:27 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the\r\nPhilistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and\r\nthey gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.\r\n\r\n18:28 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that\r\nMichal Saul\xe2\x80\x99s daughter loved him.\r\n\r\n18:29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s enemy continually.\r\n\r\n18:30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to\r\npass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely\r\nthan all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.\r\n\r\n19:1 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that\r\nthey should kill David.\r\n\r\n19:2 But Jonathan Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan\r\ntold David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now\r\ntherefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and\r\nabide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 19:3 And I will go out and\r\nstand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune\r\nwith my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.\r\n\r\n19:4 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said\r\nunto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;\r\nbecause he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have\r\nbeen to thee-ward very good: 19:5 For he did put his life in his hand,\r\nand slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for\r\nall Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt\r\nthou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?  19:6\r\nAnd Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the\r\nLORD liveth, he shall not be slain.\r\n\r\n19:7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAnd Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in\r\ntimes past.\r\n\r\n19:8 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the\r\nPhilistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n19:9 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his\r\nhouse with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.\r\n\r\n19:10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the\r\njavelin: but he slipped away out of Saul\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and he smote the\r\njavelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.\r\n\r\n19:11 Saul also sent messengers unto David\xe2\x80\x99s house, to watch him, and\r\nto slay him in the morning: and Michal David\xe2\x80\x99s wife told him, saying,\r\nIf thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.\r\n\r\n19:12 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and\r\nfled, and escaped.\r\n\r\n19:13 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a\r\npillow of goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.\r\n\r\n19:14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n19:15 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring\r\nhim up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.\r\n\r\n19:16 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image\r\nin the bed, with a pillow of goats\xe2\x80\x99 hair for his bolster.\r\n\r\n19:17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and\r\nsent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He\r\nsaid unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?  19:18 So David fled,\r\nand escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul\r\nhad done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.\r\n\r\n19:19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in\r\nRamah.\r\n\r\n19:20 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the\r\ncompany of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed\r\nover them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they\r\nalso prophesied.\r\n\r\n19:21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they\r\nprophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time,\r\nand they prophesied also.\r\n\r\n19:22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in\r\nSechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one\r\nsaid, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.\r\n\r\n19:23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God\r\nwas upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to\r\nNaioth in Ramah.\r\n\r\n19:24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before\r\nSamuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that\r\nnight. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?  20:1 And\r\nDavid fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan,\r\nWhat have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy\r\nfather, that he seeketh my life?  20:2 And he said unto him, God\r\nforbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either\r\ngreat or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father\r\nhide this thing from me? it is not so.\r\n\r\n20:3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth\r\nthat I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan\r\nknow this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as\r\nthy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.\r\n\r\n20:4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I\r\nwill even do it for thee.\r\n\r\n20:5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,\r\nand I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go,\r\nthat I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.\r\n\r\n20:6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked\r\nleave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a\r\nyearly sacrifice there for all the family.\r\n\r\n20:7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if\r\nhe be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.\r\n\r\n20:8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast\r\nbrought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee:\r\nnotwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why\r\nshouldest thou bring me to thy father?  20:9 And Jonathan said, Far be\r\nit from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my\r\nfather to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?  20:10 Then\r\nsaid David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father\r\nanswer thee roughly?  20:11 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and\r\nlet us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n20:12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have\r\nsounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and,\r\nbehold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,\r\nand shew it thee; 20:13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but\r\nif it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and\r\nsend thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with\r\nthee, as he hath been with my father.\r\n\r\n20:14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of\r\nthe LORD, that I die not: 20:15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy\r\nkindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off\r\nthe enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let\r\nthe LORD even require it at the hand of David\xe2\x80\x99s enemies.\r\n\r\n20:17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:\r\nfor he loved him as he loved his own soul.\r\n\r\n20:18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou\r\nshalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.\r\n\r\n20:19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down\r\nquickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the\r\nbusiness was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.\r\n\r\n20:20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I\r\nshot at a mark.\r\n\r\n20:21 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.\r\nIf I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side\r\nof thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no\r\nhurt; as the LORD liveth.\r\n\r\n20:22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are\r\nbeyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.\r\n\r\n20:23 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,\r\nbehold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.\r\n\r\n20:24 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was\r\ncome, the king sat him down to eat meat.\r\n\r\n20:25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a\r\nseat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nand David\xe2\x80\x99s place was empty.\r\n\r\n20:26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,\r\nSomething hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.\r\n\r\n20:27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of\r\nthe month, that David\xe2\x80\x99s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan\r\nhis son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither\r\nyesterday, nor to day?  20:28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David\r\nearnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: 20:29 And he said, Let\r\nme go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and\r\nmy brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found\r\nfavour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my\r\nbrethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n20:30 Then Saul\xe2\x80\x99s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto\r\nhim, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that\r\nthou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the\r\nconfusion of thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness?  20:31 For as long as the son of\r\nJesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy\r\nkingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n20:32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,\r\nWherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  20:33 And Saul cast a\r\njavelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was\r\ndetermined of his father to slay David.\r\n\r\n20:34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no\r\nmeat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,\r\nbecause his father had done him shame.\r\n\r\n20:35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into\r\nthe field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.\r\n\r\n20:36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I\r\nshoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\r\n\r\n20:37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which\r\nJonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the\r\narrow beyond thee?  20:38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make\r\nspeed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s lad gathered up the arrows, and\r\ncame to his master.\r\n\r\n20:39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n20:40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,\r\nGo, carry them to the city.\r\n\r\n20:41 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place\r\ntoward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed\r\nhimself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with\r\nanother, until David exceeded.\r\n\r\n20:42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have\r\nsworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between\r\nme and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose\r\nand departed: and Jonathan went into the city.\r\n\r\n21:1 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was\r\nafraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone,\r\nand no man with thee?  21:2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest,\r\nThe king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no\r\nman know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I\r\nhave commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such\r\na place.\r\n\r\n21:3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of\r\nbread in mine hand, or what there is present.\r\n\r\n21:4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread\r\nunder mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have\r\nkept themselves at least from women.\r\n\r\n21:5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth\r\nwomen have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out,\r\nand the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a\r\nmanner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.\r\n\r\n21:6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread\r\nthere but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put\r\nhot bread in the day when it was taken away.\r\n\r\n21:7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,\r\ndetained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the\r\nchiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.\r\n\r\n21:8 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine\r\nhand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my\r\nweapons with me, because the king\xe2\x80\x99s business required haste.\r\n\r\n21:9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom\r\nthou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a\r\ncloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is\r\nno other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give\r\nit me.\r\n\r\n21:10 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to\r\nAchish the king of Gath.\r\n\r\n21:11 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the\r\nking of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances,\r\nsaying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\r\n21:12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid\r\nof Achish the king of Gath.\r\n\r\n21:13 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself\r\nmad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let\r\nhis spittle fall down upon his beard.\r\n\r\n21:14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:\r\nwherefore then have ye brought him to me?  21:15 Have I need of mad\r\nmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my\r\npresence? shall this fellow come into my house?  22:1 David therefore\r\ndeparted thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his\r\nbrethren and all his father\xe2\x80\x99s house heard it, they went down thither\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n22:2 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in\r\ndebt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto\r\nhim; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about\r\nfour hundred men.\r\n\r\n22:3 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the\r\nking of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,\r\nand be with you, till I know what God will do for me.\r\n\r\n22:4 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with\r\nhim all the while that David was in the hold.\r\n\r\n22:5 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;\r\ndepart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and\r\ncame into the forest of Hareth.\r\n\r\n22:6 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were\r\nwith him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his\r\nspear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) 22:7\r\nThen Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye\r\nBenjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and\r\nvineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of\r\nhundreds; 22:8 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is\r\nnone that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of\r\nJesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto\r\nme that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait,\r\nas at this day?  22:9 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set\r\nover the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to\r\nNob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.\r\n\r\n22:10 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and\r\ngave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\r\n\r\n22:11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of\r\nAhitub, and all his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, the priests that were in Nob: and\r\nthey came all of them to the king.\r\n\r\n22:12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,\r\nHere I am, my lord.\r\n\r\n22:13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou\r\nand the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword,\r\nand hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to\r\nlie in wait, as at this day?  22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king,\r\nand said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David,\r\nwhich is the king\xe2\x80\x99s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is\r\nhonourable in thine house?  22:15 Did I then begin to enquire of God\r\nfor him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his\r\nservant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew\r\nnothing of all this, less or more.\r\n\r\n22:16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and\r\nall thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n22:17 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,\r\nand slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with\r\nDavid, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.\r\nBut the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall\r\nupon the priests of the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.\r\nAnd Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on\r\nthat day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.\r\n\r\n22:19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the\r\nsword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and\r\nasses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.\r\n\r\n22:20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named\r\nAbiathar, escaped, and fled after David.\r\n\r\n22:21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n22:22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the\r\nEdomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned\r\nthe death of all the persons of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n22:23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life\r\nseeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.\r\n\r\n23:1 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight\r\nagainst Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.\r\n\r\n23:2 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and\r\nsmite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite\r\nthe Philistines, and save Keilah.\r\n\r\n23:3 And David\xe2\x80\x99s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in\r\nJudah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of\r\nthe Philistines?  23:4 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And\r\nthe LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will\r\ndeliver the Philistines into thine hand.\r\n\r\n23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the\r\nPhilistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a\r\ngreat slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.\r\n\r\n23:6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to\r\nDavid to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.\r\n\r\n23:7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul\r\nsaid, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by\r\nentering into a town that hath gates and bars.\r\n\r\n23:8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to\r\nKeilah, to besiege David and his men.\r\n\r\n23:9 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;\r\nand he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.\r\n\r\n23:10 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath\r\ncertainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the\r\ncity for my sake.\r\n\r\n23:11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul\r\ncome down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech\r\nthee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.\r\n\r\n23:12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men\r\ninto the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.\r\n\r\n23:13 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and\r\ndeparted out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it\r\nwas told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n23:14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained\r\nin a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every\r\nday, but God delivered him not into his hand.\r\n\r\n23:15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David\r\nwas in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.\r\n\r\n23:16 And Jonathan Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son arose, and went to David into the wood,\r\nand strengthened his hand in God.\r\n\r\n23:17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father\r\nshall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall\r\nbe next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.\r\n\r\n23:18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in\r\nthe wood, and Jonathan went to his house.\r\n\r\n23:19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not\r\nDavid hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of\r\nHachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?  23:20 Now therefore, O\r\nking, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down;\r\nand our part shall be to deliver him into the king\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n23:21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion\r\non me.\r\n\r\n23:22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where\r\nhis haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he\r\ndealeth very subtilly.\r\n\r\n23:23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places\r\nwhere he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty,\r\nand I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the\r\nland, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n23:24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his\r\nmen were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of\r\nJeshimon.\r\n\r\n23:25 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;\r\nwherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of\r\nMaon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the\r\nwilderness of Maon.\r\n\r\n23:26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his\r\nmen on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for\r\nfear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round\r\nabout to take them.\r\n\r\n23:27 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and\r\ncome; for the Philistines have invaded the land.\r\n\r\n23:28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went\r\nagainst the Philistines: therefore they called that place\r\nSelahammahlekoth.\r\n\r\n23:29 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at\r\nEngedi.\r\n\r\n24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the\r\nPhilistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the\r\nwilderness of Engedi.\r\n\r\n24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and\r\nwent to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.\r\n\r\n24:3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and\r\nSaul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the\r\nsides of the cave.\r\n\r\n24:4 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the\r\nLORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine\r\nhand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then\r\nDavid arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul\xe2\x80\x99s robe privily.\r\n\r\n24:5 And it came to pass afterward, that David\xe2\x80\x99s heart smote him,\r\nbecause he had cut off Saul\xe2\x80\x99s skirt.\r\n\r\n24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this\r\nthing unto my master, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand\r\nagainst him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them\r\nnot to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went\r\non his way.\r\n\r\n24:8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried\r\nafter Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,\r\nDavid stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.\r\n\r\n24:9 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men\xe2\x80\x99s words,\r\nsaying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?  24:10 Behold, this day thine\r\neyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine\r\nhand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared\r\nthee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for\r\nhe is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed.\r\n\r\n24:11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my\r\nhand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee\r\nnot, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in\r\nmine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my\r\nsoul to take it.\r\n\r\n24:12 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of\r\nthee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.\r\n\r\n24:13 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from\r\nthe wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.\r\n\r\n24:14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou\r\npursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.\r\n\r\n24:15 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and\r\nsee, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.\r\n\r\n24:16 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking\r\nthese words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son\r\nDavid? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\r\n\r\n24:17 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou\r\nhast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.\r\n\r\n24:18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with\r\nme: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou\r\nkilledst me not.\r\n\r\n24:19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?\r\nwherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n24:20 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and\r\nthat the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.\r\n\r\n24:21 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut\r\noff my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n24:22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his\r\nmen gat them up unto the hold.\r\n\r\n25:1 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,\r\nand lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David\r\narose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.\r\n\r\n25:2 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;\r\nand the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a\r\nthousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.\r\n\r\n25:3 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife\r\nAbigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful\r\ncountenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he\r\nwas of the house of Caleb.\r\n\r\n25:4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.\r\n\r\n25:5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young\r\nmen, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:\r\n25:6 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be\r\nboth to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that\r\nthou hast.\r\n\r\n25:7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds\r\nwhich were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing\r\nunto them, all the while they were in Carmel.\r\n\r\n25:8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the\r\nyoung men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give,\r\nI pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to\r\nthy son David.\r\n\r\n25:9 And when David\xe2\x80\x99s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to\r\nall those words in the name of David, and ceased.\r\n\r\n25:10 And Nabal answered David\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and said, Who is David? and\r\nwho is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break\r\naway every man from his master.\r\n\r\n25:11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I\r\nhave killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not\r\nwhence they be?  25:12 So David\xe2\x80\x99s young men turned their way, and went\r\nagain, and came and told him all those sayings.\r\n\r\n25:13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And\r\nthey girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his\r\nsword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two\r\nhundred abode by the stuff.\r\n\r\n25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal\xe2\x80\x99s wife, saying,\r\nBehold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our\r\nmaster; and he railed on them.\r\n\r\n25:15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,\r\nneither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them,\r\nwhen we were in the fields: 25:16 They were a wall unto us both by\r\nnight and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.\r\n\r\n25:17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is\r\ndetermined against our master, and against all his household: for he\r\nis such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.\r\n\r\n25:18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two\r\nbottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of\r\nparched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred\r\ncakes of figs, and laid them on asses.\r\n\r\n25:19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come\r\nafter you. But she told not her husband Nabal.\r\n\r\n25:20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the\r\ncovert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against\r\nher; and she met them.\r\n\r\n25:21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this\r\nfellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that\r\npertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.\r\n\r\n25:22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of\r\nall that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n25:23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,\r\nand fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,\r\n25:24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let\r\nthis iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine\r\naudience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.\r\n\r\n25:25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even\r\nNabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is\r\nwith him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom\r\nthou didst send.\r\n\r\n25:26 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul\r\nliveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed\r\nblood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine\r\nenemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.\r\n\r\n25:27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my\r\nlord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.\r\n\r\n25:28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the\r\nLORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord\r\nfighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee\r\nall thy days.\r\n\r\n25:29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the\r\nsoul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy\r\nGod; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out\r\nof the middle of a sling.\r\n\r\n25:30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my\r\nlord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee,\r\nand shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; 25:31 That this shall\r\nbe no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that\r\nthou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself:\r\nbut when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember\r\nthine handmaid.\r\n\r\n25:32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,\r\nwhich sent thee this day to meet me: 25:33 And blessed be thy advice,\r\nand blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed\r\nblood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.\r\n\r\n25:34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath\r\nkept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to\r\nmeet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning\r\nlight any that pisseth against the wall.\r\n\r\n25:35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,\r\nand said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have\r\nhearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.\r\n\r\n25:36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his\r\nhouse, like the feast of a king; and Nabal\xe2\x80\x99s heart was merry within\r\nhim, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or\r\nmore, until the morning light.\r\n\r\n25:37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out\r\nof Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died\r\nwithin him, and he became as a stone.\r\n\r\n25:38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote\r\nNabal, that he died.\r\n\r\n25:39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be\r\nthe LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of\r\nNabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned\r\nthe wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed\r\nwith Abigail, to take her to him to wife.\r\n\r\n25:40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,\r\nthey spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to\r\nhim to wife.\r\n\r\n25:41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and\r\nsaid, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the\r\nservants of my lord.\r\n\r\n25:42 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five\r\ndamsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers\r\nof David, and became his wife.\r\n\r\n25:43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of\r\nthem his wives.\r\n\r\n25:44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David\xe2\x80\x99s wife, to Phalti\r\nthe son of Laish, which was of Gallim.\r\n\r\n26:1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David\r\nhide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?  26:2\r\nThen Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three\r\nthousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the\r\nwilderness of Ziph.\r\n\r\n26:3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before\r\nJeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw\r\nthat Saul came after him into the wilderness.\r\n\r\n26:4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come\r\nin very deed.\r\n\r\n26:5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:\r\nand David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,\r\nthe captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people\r\npitched round about him.\r\n\r\n26:6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to\r\nAbishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down\r\nwith me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,\r\nSaul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground\r\nat his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.\r\n\r\n26:8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into\r\nthine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with\r\nthe spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\n26:9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch\r\nforth his hand against the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed, and be guiltless?  26:10\r\nDavid said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him;\r\nor his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and\r\nperish.\r\n\r\n26:11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against\r\nthe LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is\r\nat his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.\r\n\r\n26:12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,\r\nneither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from\r\nthe LORD was fallen upon them.\r\n\r\n26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of\r\nan hill afar off; a great space being between them: 26:14 And David\r\ncried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest\r\nthou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that\r\ncriest to the king?  26:15 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a\r\nvaliant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast\r\nthou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in\r\nto destroy the king thy lord.\r\n\r\n26:16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,\r\nye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanointed.\r\n\r\nAnd now see where the king\xe2\x80\x99s spear is, and the cruse of water that was\r\nat his bolster.\r\n\r\n26:17 And Saul knew David\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son\r\nDavid? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.\r\n\r\n26:18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his\r\nservant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?  26:19\r\nNow therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his\r\nservant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept\r\nan offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before\r\nthe LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the\r\ninheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.\r\n\r\n26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the\r\nface of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea,\r\nas when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.\r\n\r\n26:21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will\r\nno more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this\r\nday: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.\r\n\r\n26:22 And David answered and said, Behold the king\xe2\x80\x99s spear! and let\r\none of the young men come over and fetch it.\r\n\r\n26:23 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his\r\nfaithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I\r\nwould not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed.\r\n\r\n26:24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,\r\nso let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him\r\ndeliver me out of all tribulation.\r\n\r\n26:25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou\r\nshalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David\r\nwent on his way, and Saul returned to his place.\r\n\r\n27:1 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the\r\nhand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should\r\nspeedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall\r\ndespair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I\r\nescape out of his hand.\r\n\r\n27:2 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that\r\nwere with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.\r\n\r\n27:3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man\r\nwith his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the\r\nJezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n27:4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought\r\nno more again for him.\r\n\r\n27:5 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine\r\neyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may\r\ndwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with\r\nthee?  27:6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag\r\npertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.\r\n\r\n27:7 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines\r\nwas a full year and four months.\r\n\r\n27:8 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and\r\nthe Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the\r\ninhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n27:9 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,\r\nand took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels,\r\nand the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.\r\n\r\n27:10 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David\r\nsaid, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the\r\nJerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.\r\n\r\n27:11 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to\r\nGath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and\r\nso will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n27:12 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people\r\nIsrael utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for\r\never.\r\n\r\n28:1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered\r\ntheir armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish\r\nsaid unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me\r\nto battle, thou and thy men.\r\n\r\n28:2 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant\r\ncan do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of\r\nmine head for ever.\r\n\r\n28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried\r\nhim in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that\r\nhad familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.\r\n\r\n28:4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and\r\npitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they\r\npitched in Gilboa.\r\n\r\n28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and\r\nhis heart greatly trembled.\r\n\r\n28:6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,\r\nneither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\r\n\r\n28:7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a\r\nfamiliar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his\r\nservants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar\r\nspirit at Endor.\r\n\r\n28:8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he\r\nwent, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and\r\nhe said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring\r\nme him up, whom I shall name unto thee.\r\n\r\n28:9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath\r\ndone, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the\r\nwizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my\r\nlife, to cause me to die?  28:10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD,\r\nsaying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee\r\nfor this thing.\r\n\r\n28:11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he\r\nsaid, Bring me up Samuel.\r\n\r\n28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and\r\nthe woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou\r\nart Saul.\r\n\r\n28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?\r\nAnd the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.\r\n\r\n28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old\r\nman cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived\r\nthat it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and\r\nbowed himself.\r\n\r\n28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring\r\nme up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines\r\nmake war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no\r\nmore, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called\r\nthee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.\r\n\r\n28:16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the\r\nLORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?  28:17 And the\r\nLORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the\r\nkingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to\r\nDavid: 28:18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor\r\nexecutedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done\r\nthis thing unto thee this day.\r\n\r\n28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the\r\nhand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with\r\nme: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of\r\nthe Philistines.\r\n\r\n28:20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore\r\nafraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in\r\nhim; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.\r\n\r\n28:21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,\r\nand said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I\r\nhave put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which\r\nthou spakest unto me.\r\n\r\n28:22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of\r\nthine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat,\r\nthat thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.\r\n\r\n28:23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,\r\ntogether with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their\r\nvoice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.\r\n\r\n28:24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and\r\nkilled it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened\r\nbread thereof: 28:25 And she brought it before Saul, and before his\r\nservants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n29:1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:\r\nand the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.\r\n\r\n29:2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by\r\nthousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with\r\nAchish.\r\n\r\n29:3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews\r\nhere?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not\r\nthis David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been\r\nwith me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him\r\nsince he fell unto me unto this day?  29:4 And the princes of the\r\nPhilistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines\r\nsaid unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his\r\nplace which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us\r\nto battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith\r\nshould he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the\r\nheads of these men?  29:5 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to\r\nanother in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten\r\nthousands?  29:6 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,\r\nas the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy\r\ncoming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not\r\nfound evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day:\r\nnevertheless the lords favour thee not.\r\n\r\n29:7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not\r\nthe lords of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n29:8 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast\r\nthou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this\r\nday, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\r\n29:9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good\r\nin my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the\r\nPhilistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.\r\n\r\n29:10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the\r\nmorning, and have light, depart.\r\n\r\n29:11 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to\r\nreturn into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up\r\nto Jezreel.\r\n\r\n30:1 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag\r\non the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and\r\nZiklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 30:2 And had\r\ntaken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either\r\ngreat or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.\r\n\r\n30:3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned\r\nwith fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were\r\ntaken captives.\r\n\r\n30:4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their\r\nvoice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.\r\n\r\n30:5 And David\xe2\x80\x99s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the\r\nJezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\r\n\r\n30:6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning\r\nhim, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his\r\nsons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD\r\nhis God.\r\n\r\n30:7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech\xe2\x80\x99s son, I pray\r\nthee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the\r\nephod to David.\r\n\r\n30:8 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this\r\ntroop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou\r\nshalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.\r\n\r\n30:9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and\r\ncame to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.\r\n\r\n30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred\r\nabode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the\r\nbrook Besor.\r\n\r\n30:11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to\r\nDavid, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink\r\nwater; 30:12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two\r\nclusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to\r\nhim: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and\r\nthree nights.\r\n\r\n30:13 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art\r\nthou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;\r\nand my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.\r\n\r\n30:14 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon\r\nthe coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and\r\nwe burned Ziklag with fire.\r\n\r\n30:15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?\r\nAnd he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor\r\ndeliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to\r\nthis company.\r\n\r\n30:16 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread\r\nabroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because\r\nof all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the\r\nPhilistines, and out of the land of Judah.\r\n\r\n30:17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of\r\nthe next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred\r\nyoung men, which rode upon camels, and fled.\r\n\r\n30:18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:\r\nand David rescued his two wives.\r\n\r\n30:19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,\r\nneither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had\r\ntaken to them: David recovered all.\r\n\r\n30:20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave\r\nbefore those other cattle, and said, This is David\xe2\x80\x99s spoil.\r\n\r\n30:21 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that\r\nthey could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the\r\nbrook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people\r\nthat were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n30:22 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those\r\nthat went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will\r\nnot give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every\r\nman his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\n30:23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that\r\nwhich the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the\r\ncompany that came against us into our hand.\r\n\r\n30:24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is\r\nthat goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by\r\nthe stuff: they shall part alike.\r\n\r\n30:25 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute\r\nand an ordinance for Israel unto this day.\r\n\r\n30:26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the\r\nelders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you\r\nof the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 30:27 To them which were in\r\nBethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were\r\nin Jattir, 30:28 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which\r\nwere in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 30:29 And to\r\nthem which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the\r\nJerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,\r\n30:30 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in\r\nChorashan, and to them which were in Athach, 30:31 And to them which\r\nwere in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men\r\nwere wont to haunt.\r\n\r\n31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel\r\nfled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.\r\n\r\n31:2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;\r\nand the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua,\r\nSaul\xe2\x80\x99s sons.\r\n\r\n31:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;\r\nand he was sore wounded of the archers.\r\n\r\n31:4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust\r\nme through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me\r\nthrough, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore\r\nafraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.\r\n\r\n31:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell\r\nlikewise upon his sword, and died with him.\r\n\r\n31:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all\r\nhis men, that same day together.\r\n\r\n31:7 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the\r\nvalley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men\r\nof Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the\r\ncities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.\r\n\r\n31:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to\r\nstrip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in\r\nmount Gilboa.\r\n\r\n31:9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent\r\ninto the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the\r\nhouse of their idols, and among the people.\r\n\r\n31:10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they\r\nfastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.\r\n\r\n31:11 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the\r\nPhilistines had done to Saul; 31:12 All the valiant men arose, and\r\nwent all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons\r\nfrom the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.\r\n\r\n31:13 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at\r\nJabesh, and fasted seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Book of Samuel\r\n\r\nOtherwise Called:\r\n\r\nThe Second Book of the Kings\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was\r\nreturned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two\r\ndays in Ziklag; 1:2 It came even to pass on the third day, that,\r\nbehold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent,\r\nand earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he\r\nfell to the earth, and did obeisance.\r\n\r\n1:3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto\r\nhim, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.\r\n\r\n1:4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of\r\nthe people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are\r\ndead also.\r\n\r\n1:5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou\r\nthat Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  1:6 And the young man that\r\ntold him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul\r\nleaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed\r\nhard after him.\r\n\r\n1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And\r\nI answered, Here am I.\r\n\r\n1:8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an\r\nAmalekite.\r\n\r\n1:9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:\r\nfor anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.\r\n\r\n1:10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he\r\ncould not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was\r\nupon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought\r\nthem hither unto my lord.\r\n\r\n1:11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise\r\nall the men that were with him: 1:12 And they mourned, and wept, and\r\nfasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the\r\npeople of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were\r\nfallen by the sword.\r\n\r\n1:13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?\r\nAnd he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.\r\n\r\n1:14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch\r\nforth thine hand to destroy the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anointed?  1:15 And David\r\ncalled one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And\r\nhe smote him that he died.\r\n\r\n1:16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy\r\nmouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanointed.\r\n\r\n1:17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over\r\nJonathan his son: 1:18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah\r\nthe use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)\r\n1:19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the\r\nmighty fallen!  1:20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the\r\nstreets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,\r\nlest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\r\n\r\n1:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be\r\nrain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the\r\nmighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not\r\nbeen anointed with oil.\r\n\r\n1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow\r\nof Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\r\n\r\n1:23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in\r\ntheir death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they\r\nwere stronger than lions.\r\n\r\n1:24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in\r\nscarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your\r\napparel.\r\n\r\n1:25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,\r\nthou wast slain in thine high places.\r\n\r\n1:26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast\r\nthou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n1:27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  2:1\r\nAnd it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD,\r\nsaying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD\r\nsaid unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he\r\nsaid, Unto Hebron.\r\n\r\n2:2 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the\r\nJezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal\xe2\x80\x99s wife the Carmelite.\r\n\r\n2:3 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with\r\nhis household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.\r\n\r\n2:4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over\r\nthe house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of\r\nJabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.\r\n\r\n2:5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said\r\nunto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this\r\nkindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.\r\n\r\n2:6 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will\r\nrequite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.\r\n\r\n2:7 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:\r\nfor your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have\r\nanointed me king over them.\r\n\r\n2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul\xe2\x80\x99s host, took Ishbosheth\r\nthe son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 2:9 And made him\r\nking over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over\r\nEphraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.\r\n\r\n2:10 Ishbosheth Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son was forty years old when he began to reign\r\nover Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n2:11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of\r\nJudah was seven years and six months.\r\n\r\n2:12 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son\r\nof Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.\r\n\r\n2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,\r\nand met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on\r\nthe one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.\r\n\r\n2:14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play\r\nbefore us. And Joab said, Let them arise.\r\n\r\n2:15 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,\r\nwhich pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the\r\nservants of David.\r\n\r\n2:16 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his\r\nsword in his fellow\xe2\x80\x99s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that\r\nplace was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.\r\n\r\n2:17 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,\r\nand the men of Israel, before the servants of David.\r\n\r\n2:18 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,\r\nand Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.\r\n\r\n2:19 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the\r\nright hand nor to the left from following Abner.\r\n\r\n2:20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he\r\nanswered, I am.\r\n\r\n2:21 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to\r\nthy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nBut Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.\r\n\r\n2:22 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following\r\nme: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I\r\nhold up my face to Joab thy brother?  2:23 Howbeit he refused to turn\r\naside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him\r\nunder the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell\r\ndown there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as\r\nmany as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.\r\n\r\n2:24 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down\r\nwhen they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by\r\nthe way of the wilderness of Gibeon.\r\n\r\n2:25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after\r\nAbner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.\r\n\r\n2:26 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for\r\never?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?\r\nhow long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from\r\nfollowing their brethren?  2:27 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless\r\nthou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up\r\nevery one from following his brother.\r\n\r\n2:28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and\r\npursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.\r\n\r\n2:29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,\r\nand passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to\r\nMahanaim.\r\n\r\n2:30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered\r\nall the people together, there lacked of David\xe2\x80\x99s servants nineteen men\r\nand Asahel.\r\n\r\n2:31 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen, so that three hundred and threescore men died.\r\n\r\n2:32 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his\r\nfather, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night,\r\nand they came to Hebron at break of day.\r\n\r\n3:1 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of\r\nDavid: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul\r\nwaxed weaker and weaker.\r\n\r\n3:2 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was\r\nAmnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3:3 And his second, Chileab, of\r\nAbigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the\r\nson of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 3:4 And the\r\nfourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son\r\nof Abital; 3:5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David\xe2\x80\x99s wife. These\r\nwere born to David in Hebron.\r\n\r\n3:6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul\r\nand the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house\r\nof Saul.\r\n\r\n3:7 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of\r\nAiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s concubine?  3:8 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of\r\nIshbosheth, and said, Am I a dog\xe2\x80\x99s head, which against Judah do shew\r\nkindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,\r\nand to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of\r\nDavid, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this\r\nwoman?  3:9 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD\r\nhath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 3:10 To translate the\r\nkingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over\r\nIsrael and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.\r\n\r\n3:11 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3:12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose\r\nis the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my\r\nhand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.\r\n\r\n3:13 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing\r\nI require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou\r\nfirst bring Michal Saul\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.\r\n\r\n3:14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son, saying,\r\nDeliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred\r\nforeskins of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n3:15 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from\r\nPhaltiel the son of Laish.\r\n\r\n3:16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to\r\nBahurim.\r\n\r\nThen said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.\r\n\r\n3:17 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye\r\nsought for David in times past to be king over you: 3:18 Now then do\r\nit: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my\r\nservant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the\r\nPhilistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.\r\n\r\n3:19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also\r\nto speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to\r\nIsrael, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.\r\n\r\n3:20 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And\r\nDavid made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.\r\n\r\n3:21 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather\r\nall Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with\r\nthee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.\r\nAnd David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\r\n\r\n3:22 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a\r\ntroop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with\r\nDavid in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.\r\n\r\n3:23 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told\r\nJoab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent\r\nhim away, and he is gone in peace.\r\n\r\n3:24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?\r\nbehold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away,\r\nand he is quite gone?  3:25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he\r\ncame to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and\r\nto know all that thou doest.\r\n\r\n3:26 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after\r\nAbner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew\r\nit not.\r\n\r\n3:27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the\r\ngate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth\r\nrib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.\r\n\r\n3:28 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are\r\nguiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of\r\nNer: 3:29 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an\r\nissue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth\r\non the sword, or that lacketh bread.\r\n\r\n3:30 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain\r\ntheir brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\r\n\r\n3:31 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,\r\nRend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before\r\nAbner. And king David himself followed the bier.\r\n\r\n3:32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his\r\nvoice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.\r\n\r\n3:33 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool\r\ndieth?  3:34 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:\r\nas a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the\r\npeople wept again over him.\r\n\r\n3:35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it\r\nwas yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I\r\ntaste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.\r\n\r\n3:36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as\r\nwhatsoever the king did pleased all the people.\r\n\r\n3:37 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was\r\nnot of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.\r\n\r\n3:38 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a\r\nprince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?  3:39 And I am this\r\nday weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be\r\ntoo hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to\r\nhis wickedness.\r\n\r\n4:1 And when Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands\r\nwere feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\r\n\r\n4:2 And Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name\r\nof the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of\r\nRimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also\r\nwas reckoned to Benjamin.\r\n\r\n4:3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there\r\nuntil this day.)  4:4 And Jonathan, Saul\xe2\x80\x99s son, had a son that was\r\nlame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul\r\nand Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and\r\nit came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became\r\nlame. And his name was Mephibosheth.\r\n\r\n4:5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,\r\nand came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay\r\non a bed at noon.\r\n\r\n4:6 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they\r\nwould have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and\r\nRechab and Baanah his brother escaped.\r\n\r\n4:7 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his\r\nbedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and\r\ntook his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.\r\n\r\n4:8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and\r\nsaid to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine\r\nenemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the\r\nking this day of Saul, and of his seed.\r\n\r\n4:9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of\r\nRimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who\r\nhath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 4:10 When one told me,\r\nsaying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I\r\ntook hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would\r\nhave given him a reward for his tidings: 4:11 How much more, when\r\nwicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his\r\nbed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and\r\ntake you away from the earth?  4:12 And David commanded his young men,\r\nand they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged\r\nthem up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth,\r\nand buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.\r\n\r\n5:1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and\r\nspake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.\r\n\r\n5:2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that\r\nleddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou\r\nshalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.\r\n\r\n5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king\r\nDavid made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they\r\nanointed David king over Israel.\r\n\r\n5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\n5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in\r\nJerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.\r\n\r\n5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the\r\ninhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou\r\ntake away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:\r\nthinking, David cannot come in hither.\r\n\r\n5:7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the\r\ncity of David.\r\n\r\n5:8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,\r\nand smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated\r\nof David\xe2\x80\x99s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said,\r\nThe blind and the lame shall not come into the house.\r\n\r\n5:9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And\r\nDavid built round about from Millo and inward.\r\n\r\n5:10 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,\r\nand carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.\r\n\r\n5:12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over\r\nIsrael, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n5:13 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,\r\nafter he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters\r\nborn to David.\r\n\r\n5:14 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in\r\nJerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 5:15 Ibhar\r\nalso, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 5:16 And Elishama, and\r\nEliada, and Eliphalet.\r\n\r\n5:17 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king\r\nover Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David\r\nheard of it, and went down to the hold.\r\n\r\n5:18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of\r\nRephaim.\r\n\r\n5:19 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the\r\nPhilistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said\r\nunto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into\r\nthine hand.\r\n\r\n5:20 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and\r\nsaid, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the\r\nbreach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place\r\nBaalperazim.\r\n\r\n5:21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n5:22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in\r\nthe valley of Rephaim.\r\n\r\n5:23 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go\r\nup; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against\r\nthe mulberry trees.\r\n\r\n5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops\r\nof the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then\r\nshall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n5:25 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the\r\nPhilistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.\r\n\r\n6:1 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,\r\nthirty thousand.\r\n\r\n6:2 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him\r\nfrom Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose\r\nname is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between\r\nthe cherubims.\r\n\r\n6:3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of\r\nthe house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons\r\nof Abinadab, drave the new cart.\r\n\r\n6:4 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at\r\nGibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.\r\n\r\n6:5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on\r\nall manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on\r\npsalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.\r\n\r\n6:6 And when they came to Nachon\xe2\x80\x99s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his\r\nhand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.\r\n\r\n6:7 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote\r\nhim there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.\r\n\r\n6:8 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon\r\nUzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.\r\n\r\n6:9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the\r\nark of the LORD come to me?  6:10 So David would not remove the ark of\r\nthe LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside\r\ninto the house of Obededom the Gittite.\r\n\r\n6:11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the\r\nGittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n6:12 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the\r\nhouse of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the\r\nark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house\r\nof Obededom into the city of David with gladness.\r\n\r\n6:13 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had\r\ngone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.\r\n\r\n6:14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David\r\nwas girded with a linen ephod.\r\n\r\n6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the\r\nLORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.\r\n\r\n6:16 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal\r\nSaul\xe2\x80\x99s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping\r\nand dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.\r\n\r\n6:17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,\r\nin the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and\r\nDavid offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings\r\nand peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n6:19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude\r\nof Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread,\r\nand a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people\r\ndeparted every one to his house.\r\n\r\n6:20 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the\r\ndaughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was\r\nthe king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of\r\nthe handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly\r\nuncovereth himself!  6:21 And David said unto Michal, It was before\r\nthe LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,\r\nto appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:\r\ntherefore will I play before the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:22 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine\r\nown sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them\r\nshall I be had in honour.\r\n\r\n6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day\r\nof her death.\r\n\r\n7:1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD\r\nhad given him rest round about from all his enemies; 7:2 That the king\r\nsaid unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar,\r\nbut the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.\r\n\r\n7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;\r\nfor the LORD is with thee.\r\n\r\n7:4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came\r\nunto Nathan, saying, 7:5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the\r\nLORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?  7:6 Whereas I\r\nhave not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the\r\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in\r\na tent and in a tabernacle.\r\n\r\n7:7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of\r\nIsrael spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I\r\ncommanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an\r\nhouse of cedar?  7:8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant\r\nDavid, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,\r\nfrom following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 7:9\r\nAnd I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all\r\nthine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like\r\nunto the name of the great men that are in the earth.\r\n\r\n7:10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will\r\nplant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no\r\nmore; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,\r\nas beforetime, 7:11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to\r\nbe over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine\r\nenemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\r\n\r\n7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy\r\nfathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of\r\nthy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\r\n\r\n7:13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the\r\nthrone of his kingdom for ever.\r\n\r\n7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit\r\niniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes\r\nof the children of men: 7:15 But my mercy shall not depart away from\r\nhim, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.\r\n\r\n7:16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever\r\nbefore thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.\r\n\r\n7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,\r\nso did Nathan speak unto David.\r\n\r\n7:18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,\r\nWho am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me\r\nhitherto?  7:19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord\r\nGOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant\xe2\x80\x99s house for a great\r\nwhile to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?  7:20 And\r\nwhat can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n7:21 For thy word\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou\r\ndone all these great things, to make thy servant know them.\r\n\r\n7:22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like\r\nthee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we\r\nhave heard with our ears.\r\n\r\n7:23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like\r\nIsrael, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make\r\nhim a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land,\r\nbefore thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the\r\nnations and their gods?  7:24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy\r\npeople Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art\r\nbecome their God.\r\n\r\n7:25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning\r\nthy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do\r\nas thou hast said.\r\n\r\n7:26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts\r\nis the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be\r\nestablished before thee.\r\n\r\n7:27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy\r\nservant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy\r\nservant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.\r\n\r\n7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,\r\nand thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 7:29 Therefore\r\nnow let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may\r\ncontinue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it:\r\nand with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for\r\never.\r\n\r\n8:1 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,\r\nand subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them\r\ndown to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death,\r\nand with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and brought gifts.\r\n\r\n8:3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he\r\nwent to recover his border at the river Euphrates.\r\n\r\n8:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred\r\nhorsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the\r\nchariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.\r\n\r\n8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of\r\nZobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\n8:6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians\r\nbecame servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved\r\nDavid whithersoever he went.\r\n\r\n8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of\r\nHadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David\r\ntook exceeding much brass.\r\n\r\n8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host\r\nof Hadadezer, 8:10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to\r\nsalute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer,\r\nand smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought\r\nwith him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:\r\n8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver\r\nand gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; 8:12\r\nOf Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the\r\nPhilistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of\r\nRehob, king of Zobah.\r\n\r\n8:13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the\r\nSyrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.\r\n\r\n8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he\r\ngarrisons, and all they of Edom became David\xe2\x80\x99s servants. And the LORD\r\npreserved David whithersoever he went.\r\n\r\n8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment\r\nand justice unto all his people.\r\n\r\n8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat\r\nthe son of Ahilud was recorder; 8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and\r\nAhimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the\r\nscribe; 8:18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the\r\nCherethites and the Pelethites; and David\xe2\x80\x99s sons were chief rulers.\r\n\r\n9:1 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of\r\nSaul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s sake?  9:2 And there\r\nwas of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they\r\nhad called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And\r\nhe said, Thy servant is he.\r\n\r\n9:3 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that\r\nI may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king,\r\nJonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.\r\n\r\n9:4 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the\r\nking, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in\r\nLodebar.\r\n\r\n9:5 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,\r\nthe son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.\r\n\r\n9:6 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was\r\ncome unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David\r\nsaid, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!  9:7 And\r\nDavid said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness\r\nfor Jonathan thy father\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and will restore thee all the land of\r\nSaul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.\r\n\r\n9:8 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou\r\nshouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?  9:9 Then the king called\r\nto Ziba, Saul\xe2\x80\x99s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.\r\n\r\n9:10 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the\r\nland for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master\xe2\x80\x99s son shall eat\r\nbread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n9:11 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the\r\nking hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for\r\nMephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s sons.\r\n\r\n9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all\r\nthat dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.\r\n\r\n9:13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s table; and was lame on both his feet.\r\n\r\n10:1 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of\r\nAmmon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n10:2 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of\r\nNahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to\r\ncomfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants came into the land of the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n10:3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their\r\nlord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath\r\nsent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants\r\nunto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?\r\n10:4 Wherefore Hanun took David\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and shaved off the one\r\nhalf of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even\r\nto their buttocks, and sent them away.\r\n\r\n10:5 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the\r\nmen were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until\r\nyour beards be grown, and then return.\r\n\r\n10:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,\r\nthe children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the\r\nSyrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a\r\nthousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.\r\n\r\n10:7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the\r\nmighty men.\r\n\r\n10:8 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array\r\nat the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob,\r\nand Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.\r\n\r\n10:9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before\r\nand behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in\r\narray against the Syrians: 10:10 And the rest of the people he\r\ndelivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them\r\nin array against the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n10:11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou\r\nshalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,\r\nthen I will come and help thee.\r\n\r\n10:12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and\r\nfor the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n10:13 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the\r\nbattle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.\r\n\r\n10:14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,\r\nthen fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab\r\nreturned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n10:15 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,\r\nthey gathered themselves together.\r\n\r\n10:16 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond\r\nthe river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host\r\nof Hadarezer went before them.\r\n\r\n10:17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and\r\npassed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves\r\nin array against David, and fought with him.\r\n\r\n10:18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of\r\nseven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen,\r\nand smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.\r\n\r\n10:19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that\r\nthey were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and\r\nserved them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n11:1 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when\r\nkings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with\r\nhim, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and\r\nbesieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n11:2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off\r\nhis bed, and walked upon the roof of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house: and from the\r\nroof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful\r\nto look upon.\r\n\r\n11:3 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not\r\nthis Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\r\n11:4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto\r\nhim, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness:\r\nand she returned unto her house.\r\n\r\n11:5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am\r\nwith child.\r\n\r\n11:6 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And\r\nJoab sent Uriah to David.\r\n\r\n11:7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab\r\ndid, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.\r\n\r\n11:8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.\r\nAnd Uriah departed out of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and there followed him a\r\nmess of meat from the king.\r\n\r\n11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house with all the\r\nservants of his lord, and went not down to his house.\r\n\r\n11:10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto\r\nhis house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?\r\nwhy then didst thou not go down unto thine house?  11:11 And Uriah\r\nsaid unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and\r\nmy lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open\r\nfields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to\r\nlie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not\r\ndo this thing.\r\n\r\n11:12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I\r\nwill let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n11:13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;\r\nand he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with\r\nthe servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.\r\n\r\n11:14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to\r\nJoab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.\r\n\r\n11:15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the\r\nforefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may\r\nbe smitten, and die.\r\n\r\n11:16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he\r\nassigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.\r\n\r\n11:17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and\r\nthere fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the\r\nHittite died also.\r\n\r\n11:18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;\r\n11:19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of\r\ntelling the matters of the war unto the king, 11:20 And if so be that\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye\r\nso nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would\r\nshoot from the wall?  11:21 Who smote Abimelech the son of\r\nJerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him\r\nfrom the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then\r\nsay thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\r\n\r\n11:22 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab\r\nhad sent him for.\r\n\r\n11:23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed\r\nagainst us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them\r\neven unto the entering of the gate.\r\n\r\n11:24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and\r\nsome of the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite\r\nis dead also.\r\n\r\n11:25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto\r\nJoab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one\r\nas well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and\r\noverthrow it: and encourage thou him.\r\n\r\n11:26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was\r\ndead, she mourned for her husband.\r\n\r\n11:27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to\r\nhis house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing\r\nthat David had done displeased the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and\r\nsaid unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the\r\nother poor.\r\n\r\n12:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3 But the\r\npoor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought\r\nand nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his\r\nchildren; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and\r\nlay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.\r\n\r\n12:4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to\r\ntake of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring\r\nman that was come unto him; but took the poor man\xe2\x80\x99s lamb, and dressed\r\nit for the man that was come to him.\r\n\r\n12:5 And David\xe2\x80\x99s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he\r\nsaid to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing\r\nshall surely die: 12:6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because\r\nhe did this thing, and because he had no pity.\r\n\r\n12:7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD\r\nGod of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee\r\nout of the hand of Saul; 12:8 And I gave thee thy master\xe2\x80\x99s house, and\r\nthy master\xe2\x80\x99s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel\r\nand of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have\r\ngiven unto thee such and such things.\r\n\r\n12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do\r\nevil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,\r\nand hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the\r\nsword of the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;\r\nbecause thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the\r\nHittite to be thy wife.\r\n\r\n12:11 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee\r\nout of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,\r\nand give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in\r\nthe sight of this sun.\r\n\r\n12:12 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all\r\nIsrael, and before the sun.\r\n\r\n12:13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And\r\nNathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou\r\nshalt not die.\r\n\r\n12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to\r\nthe enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto\r\nthee shall surely die.\r\n\r\n12:15 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the\r\nchild that Uriah\xe2\x80\x99s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.\r\n\r\n12:16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,\r\nand went in, and lay all night upon the earth.\r\n\r\n12:17 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him\r\nup from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And\r\nthe servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for\r\nthey said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,\r\nand he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself,\r\nif we tell him that the child is dead?  12:19 But when David saw that\r\nhis servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead:\r\ntherefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they\r\nsaid, He is dead.\r\n\r\n12:20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed\r\nhimself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD,\r\nand worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required,\r\nthey set bread before him, and he did eat.\r\n\r\n12:21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou\r\nhast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;\r\nbut when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.\r\n\r\n12:22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:\r\nfor I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the\r\nchild may live?  12:23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?\r\ncan I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n12:24 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,\r\nand lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon:\r\nand the LORD loved him.\r\n\r\n12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his\r\nname Jedidiah, because of the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:26 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and\r\ntook the royal city.\r\n\r\n12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought\r\nagainst Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.\r\n\r\n12:28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp\r\nagainst the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called\r\nafter my name.\r\n\r\n12:29 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,\r\nand fought against it, and took it.\r\n\r\n12:30 And he took their king\xe2\x80\x99s crown from off his head, the weight\r\nwhereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set\r\non David\xe2\x80\x99s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n12:31 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them\r\nunder saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and\r\nmade them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the\r\ncities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned\r\nunto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n13:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had\r\na fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved\r\nher.\r\n\r\n13:2 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;\r\nfor she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n13:3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of\r\nShimeah David\xe2\x80\x99s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.\r\n\r\n13:4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king\xe2\x80\x99s son, lean\r\nfrom day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I\r\nlove Tamar, my brother Absalom\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\r\n\r\n13:5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make\r\nthyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I\r\npray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the\r\nmeat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.\r\n\r\n13:6 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was\r\ncome to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my\r\nsister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat\r\nat her hand.\r\n\r\n13:7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother\r\nAmnon\xe2\x80\x99s house, and dress him meat.\r\n\r\n13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\xe2\x80\x99s house; and he was laid down.\r\nAnd she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and\r\ndid bake the cakes.\r\n\r\n13:9 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he\r\nrefused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they\r\nwent out every man from him.\r\n\r\n13:10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that\r\nI may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made,\r\nand brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.\r\n\r\n13:11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of\r\nher, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.\r\n\r\n13:12 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no\r\nsuch thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.\r\n\r\n13:13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,\r\nthou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray\r\nthee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.\r\n\r\n13:14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger\r\nthan she, forced her, and lay with her.\r\n\r\n13:15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith\r\nhe hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And\r\nAmnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.\r\n\r\n13:16 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending\r\nme away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he\r\nwould not hearken unto her.\r\n\r\n13:17 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,\r\nPut now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.\r\n\r\n13:18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such\r\nrobes were the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his\r\nservant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.\r\n\r\n13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers\r\ncolours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n13:20 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother\r\nbeen with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother;\r\nregard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother\r\nAbsalom\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n13:21 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very\r\nwroth.\r\n\r\n13:22 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:\r\nfor Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.\r\n\r\n13:23 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had\r\nsheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom\r\ninvited all the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons.\r\n\r\n13:24 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant\r\nhath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go\r\nwith thy servant.\r\n\r\n13:25 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now\r\ngo, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he\r\nwould not go, but blessed him.\r\n\r\n13:26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go\r\nwith us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?\r\n13:27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsons go with him.\r\n\r\n13:28 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when\r\nAmnon\xe2\x80\x99s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite\r\nAmnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be\r\ncourageous, and be valiant.\r\n\r\n13:29 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\nThen all the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his\r\nmule, and fled.\r\n\r\n13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings\r\ncame to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and\r\nthere is not one of them left.\r\n\r\n13:31 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the\r\nearth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.\r\n\r\n13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David\xe2\x80\x99s brother, answered and\r\nsaid, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of\r\nAbsalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his\r\nsister Tamar.\r\n\r\n13:33 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his\r\nheart, to think that all the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons are dead: for Amnon only is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n13:34 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted\r\nup his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the\r\nway of the hill side behind him.\r\n\r\n13:35 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons come: as\r\nthy servant said, so it is.\r\n\r\n13:36 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,\r\nthat, behold, the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons came, and lifted up their voice and\r\nwept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.\r\n\r\n13:37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king\r\nof Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.\r\n\r\n13:38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.\r\n\r\n13:39 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for\r\nhe was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\r\n\r\n14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king\xe2\x80\x99s heart was\r\ntoward Absalom.\r\n\r\n14:2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and\r\nsaid unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on\r\nnow mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a\r\nwoman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 14:3 And come to the\r\nking, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n14:4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her\r\nface to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.\r\n\r\n14:5 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I\r\nam indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.\r\n\r\n14:6 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in\r\nthe field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the\r\nother, and slew him.\r\n\r\n14:7 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,\r\nand they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill\r\nhim, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the\r\nheir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall\r\nnot leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.\r\n\r\n14:8 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will\r\ngive charge concerning thee.\r\n\r\n14:9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the\r\niniquity be on me, and on my father\xe2\x80\x99s house: and the king and his\r\nthrone be guiltless.\r\n\r\n14:10 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to\r\nme, and he shall not touch thee any more.\r\n\r\n14:11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy\r\nGod, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy\r\nany more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth,\r\nthere shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.\r\n\r\n14:12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one\r\nword unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.\r\n\r\n14:13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a\r\nthing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as\r\none which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his\r\nbanished.\r\n\r\n14:14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,\r\nwhich cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any\r\nperson: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n14:15 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord\r\nthe king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy\r\nhandmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king\r\nwill perform the request of his handmaid.\r\n\r\n14:16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand\r\nof the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the\r\ninheritance of God.\r\n\r\n14:17 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now\r\nbe comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to\r\ndiscern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.\r\n\r\n14:18 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from\r\nme, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said,\r\nLet my lord the king now speak.\r\n\r\n14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all\r\nthis?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord\r\nthe king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought\r\nthat my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me,\r\nand he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 14:20 To\r\nfetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing:\r\nand my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to\r\nknow all things that are in the earth.\r\n\r\n14:21 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:\r\ngo therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.\r\n\r\n14:22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and\r\nthanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I\r\nhave found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath\r\nfulfilled the request of his servant.\r\n\r\n14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n14:24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him\r\nnot see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n14:25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as\r\nAbsalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of\r\nhis head there was no blemish in him.\r\n\r\n14:26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year\xe2\x80\x99s end\r\nthat he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he\r\npolled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels\r\nafter the king\xe2\x80\x99s weight.\r\n\r\n14:27 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,\r\nwhose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.\r\n\r\n14:28 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n14:29 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;\r\nbut he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time,\r\nhe would not come.\r\n\r\n14:30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab\xe2\x80\x99s field is near\r\nmine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants set the field on fire.\r\n\r\n14:31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said\r\nunto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  14:32 And\r\nAbsalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,\r\nthat I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from\r\nGeshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now\r\ntherefore let me see the king\xe2\x80\x99s face; and if there be any iniquity in\r\nme, let him kill me.\r\n\r\n14:33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called\r\nfor Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the\r\nground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.\r\n\r\n15:1 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him\r\nchariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\r\n\r\n15:2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:\r\nand it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the\r\nking for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what\r\ncity art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n15:3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;\r\nbut there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.\r\n\r\n15:4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,\r\nthat every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I\r\nwould do him justice!  15:5 And it was so, that when any man came nigh\r\nto him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and\r\nkissed him.\r\n\r\n15:6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the\r\nking for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\r\n\r\n15:7 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the\r\nking, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto\r\nthe LORD, in Hebron.\r\n\r\n15:8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,\r\nsaying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I\r\nwill serve the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:9 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to\r\nHebron.\r\n\r\n15:10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,\r\nsaying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall\r\nsay, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.\r\n\r\n15:11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that\r\nwere called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered\r\nsacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased\r\ncontinually with Absalom.\r\n\r\n15:13 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the\r\nmen of Israel are after Absalom.\r\n\r\n15:14 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at\r\nJerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from\r\nAbsalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring\r\nevil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.\r\n\r\n15:15 And the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants\r\nare ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.\r\n\r\n15:16 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And\r\nthe king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.\r\n\r\n15:17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and\r\ntarried in a place that was far off.\r\n\r\n15:18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the\r\nCherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred\r\nmen which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\r\n\r\n15:19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou\r\nalso with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou\r\nart a stranger, and also an exile.\r\n\r\n15:20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee\r\ngo up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and\r\ntake back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.\r\n\r\n15:21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and\r\nas my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king\r\nshall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n15:22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite\r\npassed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n15:23 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people\r\npassed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and\r\nall the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n15:24 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing\r\nthe ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and\r\nAbiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n15:25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the\r\ncity: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me\r\nagain, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 15:26 But if he thus\r\nsay, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as\r\nseemeth good unto him.\r\n\r\n15:27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?\r\nreturn into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy\r\nson, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\r\n\r\n15:28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there\r\ncome word from you to certify me.\r\n\r\n15:29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to\r\nJerusalem: and they tarried there.\r\n\r\n15:30 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he\r\nwent up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the\r\npeople that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up,\r\nweeping as they went up.\r\n\r\n15:31 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators\r\nwith Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of\r\nAhithophel into foolishness.\r\n\r\n15:32 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the\r\nmount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to\r\nmeet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 15:33 Unto whom\r\nDavid said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden\r\nunto me: 15:34 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I\r\nwill be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father\xe2\x80\x99s servant\r\nhitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me\r\ndefeat the counsel of Ahithophel.\r\n\r\n15:35 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the\r\npriests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt\r\nhear out of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar\r\nthe priests.\r\n\r\n15:36 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz\r\nZadok\xe2\x80\x99s son, and Jonathan Abiathar\xe2\x80\x99s son; and by them ye shall send\r\nunto me every thing that ye can hear.\r\n\r\n15:37 So Hushai David\xe2\x80\x99s friend came into the city, and Absalom came\r\ninto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n16:1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,\r\nZiba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses\r\nsaddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred\r\nbunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n16:2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba\r\nsaid, The asses be for the king\xe2\x80\x99s household to ride on; and the bread\r\nand summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as\r\nbe faint in the wilderness may drink.\r\n\r\n16:3 And the king said, And where is thy master\xe2\x80\x99s son? And Ziba said\r\nunto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day\r\nshall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.\r\n\r\n16:4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained\r\nunto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may\r\nfind grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.\r\n\r\n16:5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a\r\nman of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son\r\nof Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.\r\n\r\n16:6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king\r\nDavid: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right\r\nhand and on his left.\r\n\r\n16:7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou\r\nbloody man, and thou man of Belial: 16:8 The LORD hath returned upon\r\nthee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast\r\nreigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of\r\nAbsalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because\r\nthou art a bloody man.\r\n\r\n16:9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should\r\nthis dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and\r\ntake off his head.\r\n\r\n16:10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of\r\nZeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse\r\nDavid. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  16:11 And\r\nDavid said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which\r\ncame forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this\r\nBenjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath\r\nbidden him.\r\n\r\n16:12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that\r\nthe LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.\r\n\r\n16:13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on\r\nthe hill\xe2\x80\x99s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw\r\nstones at him, and cast dust.\r\n\r\n16:14 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,\r\nand refreshed themselves there.\r\n\r\n16:15 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to\r\nJerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.\r\n\r\n16:16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\r\nwas come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the\r\nking, God save the king.\r\n\r\n16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?\r\nwhy wentest thou not with thy friend?  16:18 And Hushai said unto\r\nAbsalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of\r\nIsrael, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.\r\n\r\n16:19 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the\r\npresence of his son? as I have served in thy father\xe2\x80\x99s presence, so\r\nwill I be in thy presence.\r\n\r\n16:20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we\r\nshall do.\r\n\r\n16:21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconcubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall\r\nhear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all\r\nthat are with thee be strong.\r\n\r\n16:22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and\r\nAbsalom went in unto his father\xe2\x80\x99s concubines in the sight of all\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n16:23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those\r\ndays, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all\r\nthe counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.\r\n\r\n17:1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out\r\ntwelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this\r\nnight: 17:2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak\r\nhanded, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him\r\nshall flee; and I will smite the king only: 17:3 And I will bring back\r\nall the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all\r\nreturned: so all the people shall be in peace.\r\n\r\n17:4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us\r\nhear likewise what he saith.\r\n\r\n17:6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,\r\nsaying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after\r\nhis saying? if not; speak thou.\r\n\r\n17:7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath\r\ngiven is not good at this time.\r\n\r\n17:8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they\r\nbe mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of\r\nher whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not\r\nlodge with the people.\r\n\r\n17:9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it\r\nwill come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that\r\nwhosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people\r\nthat follow Absalom.\r\n\r\n17:10 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a\r\nlion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a\r\nmighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.\r\n\r\n17:11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto\r\nthee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for\r\nmultitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.\r\n\r\n17:12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,\r\nand we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of\r\nhim and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so\r\nmuch as one.\r\n\r\n17:13 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel\r\nbring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until\r\nthere be not one small stone found there.\r\n\r\n17:14 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of\r\nHushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the\r\nLORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the\r\nintent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.\r\n\r\n17:15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus\r\nand thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and\r\nthus and thus have I counselled.\r\n\r\n17:16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not\r\nthis night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over;\r\nlest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.\r\n\r\n17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not\r\nbe seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and\r\nthey went and told king David.\r\n\r\n17:18 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went\r\nboth of them away quickly, and came to a man\xe2\x80\x99s house in Bahurim, which\r\nhad a well in his court; whither they went down.\r\n\r\n17:19 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\r\nand spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.\r\n\r\n17:20 And when Absalom\xe2\x80\x99s servants came to the woman to the house, they\r\nsaid, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them,\r\nThey be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and\r\ncould not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n17:21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up\r\nout of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,\r\nArise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel\r\ncounselled against you.\r\n\r\n17:22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and\r\nthey passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of\r\nthem that was not gone over Jordan.\r\n\r\n17:23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he\r\nsaddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his\r\ncity, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died,\r\nand was buried in the sepulchre of his father.\r\n\r\n17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he\r\nand all the men of Israel with him.\r\n\r\n17:25 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:\r\nwhich Amasa was a man\xe2\x80\x99s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that\r\nwent in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n17:26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.\r\n\r\n17:27 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi\r\nthe son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the\r\nson of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,\r\n17:28 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and\r\nbarley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and\r\nparched pulse, 17:29 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of\r\nkine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for\r\nthey said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n18:1 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set\r\ncaptains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.\r\n\r\n18:2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of\r\nJoab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,\r\nJoab\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.\r\nAnd the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you\r\nmyself also.\r\n\r\n18:3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee\r\naway, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they\r\ncare for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now\r\nit is better that thou succour us out of the city.\r\n\r\n18:4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And\r\nthe king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by\r\nhundreds and by thousands.\r\n\r\n18:5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal\r\ngently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the\r\npeople heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning\r\nAbsalom.\r\n\r\n18:6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the\r\nbattle was in the wood of Ephraim; 18:7 Where the people of Israel\r\nwere slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great\r\nslaughter that day of twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\n18:8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the\r\ncountry: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword\r\ndevoured.\r\n\r\n18:9 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a\r\nmule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his\r\nhead caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven\r\nand the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.\r\n\r\n18:10 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw\r\nAbsalom hanged in an oak.\r\n\r\n18:11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou\r\nsawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and\r\nI would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.\r\n\r\n18:12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand\r\nshekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand\r\nagainst the king\xe2\x80\x99s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and\r\nAbishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man\r\nAbsalom.\r\n\r\n18:13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:\r\nfor there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest\r\nhave set thyself against me.\r\n\r\n18:14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took\r\nthree darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,\r\nwhile he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.\r\n\r\n18:15 And ten young men that bare Joab\xe2\x80\x99s armour compassed about and\r\nsmote Absalom, and slew him.\r\n\r\n18:16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing\r\nafter Israel: for Joab held back the people.\r\n\r\n18:17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the\r\nwood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel\r\nfled every one to his tent.\r\n\r\n18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself\r\na pillar, which is in the king\xe2\x80\x99s dale: for he said, I have no son to\r\nkeep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own\r\nname: and it is called unto this day, Absalom\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\n18:19 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the\r\nking tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.\r\n\r\n18:20 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,\r\nbut thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear\r\nno tidings, because the king\xe2\x80\x99s son is dead.\r\n\r\n18:21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.\r\nAnd Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.\r\n\r\n18:22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But\r\nhowsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said,\r\nWherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings\r\nready?  18:23 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto\r\nhim, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.\r\n\r\n18:24 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to\r\nthe roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and\r\nlooked, and behold a man running alone.\r\n\r\n18:25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If\r\nhe be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and\r\ndrew near.\r\n\r\n18:26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman\r\ncalled unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.\r\nAnd the king said, He also bringeth tidings.\r\n\r\n18:27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost\r\nis like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He\r\nis a good man, and cometh with good tidings.\r\n\r\n18:28 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he\r\nfell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said,\r\nBlessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that\r\nlifted up their hand against my lord the king.\r\n\r\n18:29 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz\r\nanswered, When Joab sent the king\xe2\x80\x99s servant, and me thy servant, I saw\r\na great tumult, but I knew not what it was.\r\n\r\n18:30 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he\r\nturned aside, and stood still.\r\n\r\n18:31 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the\r\nking: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up\r\nagainst thee.\r\n\r\n18:32 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And\r\nCushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise\r\nagainst thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\r\n\r\n18:33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the\r\ngate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my\r\nson, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,\r\nmy son!  19:1 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and\r\nmourneth for Absalom.\r\n\r\n19:2 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the\r\npeople: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n19:3 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as\r\npeople being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\r\n\r\n19:4 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud\r\nvoice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!  19:5 And Joab\r\ncame into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day\r\nthe faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and\r\nthe lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy\r\nwives, and the lives of thy concubines; 19:6 In that thou lovest thine\r\nenemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that\r\nthou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive,\r\nthat if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had\r\npleased thee well.\r\n\r\n19:7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy\r\nservants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will\r\nnot tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee\r\nthan all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.\r\n\r\n19:8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all\r\nthe people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the\r\npeople came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his\r\ntent.\r\n\r\n19:9 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of\r\nIsrael, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and\r\nhe delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled\r\nout of the land for Absalom.\r\n\r\n19:10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now\r\ntherefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?  19:11\r\nAnd king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,\r\nSpeak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring\r\nthe king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to\r\nthe king, even to his house.\r\n\r\n19:12 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then\r\nare ye the last to bring back the king?  19:13 And say ye to Amasa,\r\nArt thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more\r\nalso, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the\r\nroom of Joab.\r\n\r\n19:14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the\r\nheart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return\r\nthou, and all thy servants.\r\n\r\n19:15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to\r\nGilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.\r\n\r\n19:16 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,\r\nhasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.\r\n\r\n19:17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the\r\nservant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty\r\nservants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.\r\n\r\n19:18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera\r\nfell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 19:19 And said\r\nunto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do\r\nthou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my\r\nlord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n19:20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,\r\nI am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to\r\nmeet my lord the king.\r\n\r\n19:21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not\r\nShimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanointed?  19:22 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons\r\nof Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall\r\nthere any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know\r\nthat I am this day king over Israel?  19:23 Therefore the king said\r\nunto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.\r\n\r\n19:24 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and\r\nhad neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his\r\nclothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n19:25 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the\r\nking, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,\r\nMephibosheth?  19:26 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant\r\ndeceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may\r\nride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.\r\n\r\n19:27 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my\r\nlord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in\r\nthine eyes.\r\n\r\n19:28 For all of my father\xe2\x80\x99s house were but dead men before my lord\r\nthe king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at\r\nthine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto\r\nthe king?  19:29 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any\r\nmore of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.\r\n\r\n19:30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,\r\nforasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n19:31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went\r\nover Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.\r\n\r\n19:32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and\r\nhe had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for\r\nhe was a very great man.\r\n\r\n19:33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I\r\nwill feed thee with me in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n19:34 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that\r\nI should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?  19:35 I am this day\r\nfourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy\r\nservant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the\r\nvoice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy\r\nservant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?  19:36 Thy servant will\r\ngo a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king\r\nrecompense it me with such a reward?  19:37 Let thy servant, I pray\r\nthee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried\r\nby the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant\r\nChimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what\r\nshall seem good unto thee.\r\n\r\n19:38 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will\r\ndo to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou\r\nshalt require of me, that will I do for thee.\r\n\r\n19:39 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come\r\nover, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto\r\nhis own place.\r\n\r\n19:40 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:\r\nand all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the\r\npeople of Israel.\r\n\r\n19:41 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said\r\nunto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee\r\naway, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen with him, over Jordan?  19:42 And all the men of Judah answered\r\nthe men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore\r\nthen be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncost? or hath he given us any gift?  19:43 And the men of Israel\r\nanswered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king,\r\nand we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise\r\nus, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?\r\nAnd the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the\r\nmen of Israel.\r\n\r\n20:1 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was\r\nSheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and\r\nsaid, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son\r\nof Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.\r\n\r\n20:2 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed\r\nSheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king,\r\nfrom Jordan even to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n20:3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the\r\nten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put\r\nthem in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were\r\nshut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.\r\n\r\n20:4 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within\r\nthree days, and be thou here present.\r\n\r\n20:5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer\r\nthan the set time which he had appointed him.\r\n\r\n20:6 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do\r\nus more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and\r\npursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.\r\n\r\n20:7 And there went out after him Joab\xe2\x80\x99s men, and the Cherethites, and\r\nthe Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of\r\nJerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\r\n\r\n20:8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went\r\nbefore them. And Joab\xe2\x80\x99s garment that he had put on was girded unto\r\nhim, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the\r\nsheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.\r\n\r\n20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab\r\ntook Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.\r\n\r\n20:10 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab\xe2\x80\x99s hand: so\r\nhe smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to\r\nthe ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai\r\nhis brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.\r\n\r\n20:11 And one of Joab\xe2\x80\x99s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth\r\nJoab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.\r\n\r\n20:12 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And\r\nwhen the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out\r\nof the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw\r\nthat every one that came by him stood still.\r\n\r\n20:13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on\r\nafter Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.\r\n\r\n20:14 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to\r\nBethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and\r\nwent also after him.\r\n\r\n20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they\r\ncast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all\r\nthe people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.\r\n\r\n20:16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray\r\nyou, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.\r\n\r\n20:17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou\r\nJoab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the\r\nwords of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.\r\n\r\n20:18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,\r\nsaying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n20:19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou\r\nseekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou\r\nswallow up the inheritance of the LORD?  20:20 And Joab answered and\r\nsaid, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\n20:21 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son\r\nof Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even\r\nagainst David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And\r\nthe woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee\r\nover the wall.\r\n\r\n20:22 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they\r\ncut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.\r\nAnd he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to\r\nhis tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.\r\n\r\n20:23 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of\r\nJehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 20:24 And\r\nAdoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was\r\nrecorder: 20:25 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the\r\npriests: 20:26 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.\r\n\r\n21:1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year\r\nafter year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It\r\nis for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.\r\n\r\n21:2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the\r\nGibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of\r\nthe Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul\r\nsought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)\r\n21:3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for\r\nyou?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the\r\ninheritance of the LORD?  21:4 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We\r\nwill have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us\r\nshalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,\r\nthat will I do for you.\r\n\r\n21:5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that\r\ndevised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any\r\nof the coasts of Israel, 21:6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered\r\nunto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,\r\nwhom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.\r\n\r\n21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of\r\nSaul, because of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s oath that was between them, between David\r\nand Jonathan the son of Saul.\r\n\r\n21:8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,\r\nwhom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of\r\nMichal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of\r\nBarzillai the Meholathite: 21:9 And he delivered them into the hands\r\nof the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD:\r\nand they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of\r\nharvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.\r\n\r\n21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it\r\nfor her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water\r\ndropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the\r\nair to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.\r\n\r\n21:11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the\r\nconcubine of Saul, had done.\r\n\r\n21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of\r\nJonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them\r\nfrom the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them,\r\nwhen the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 21:13 And he brought up\r\nfrom thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and\r\nthey gathered the bones of them that were hanged.\r\n\r\n21:14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the\r\ncountry of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and\r\nthey performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was\r\nintreated for the land.\r\n\r\n21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and\r\nDavid went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the\r\nPhilistines: and David waxed faint.\r\n\r\n21:16 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight\r\nof whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he\r\nbeing girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.\r\n\r\n21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the\r\nPhilistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,\r\nsaying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench\r\nnot the light of Israel.\r\n\r\n21:18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle\r\nwith the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,\r\nwhich was of the sons of the giant.\r\n\r\n21:19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where\r\nElhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of\r\nGoliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\n21:20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great\r\nstature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six\r\ntoes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.\r\n\r\n21:21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the\r\nbrother of David slew him.\r\n\r\n21:22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand\r\nof David, and by the hand of his servants.\r\n\r\n22:1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day\r\nthat the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,\r\nand out of the hand of Saul: 22:2 And he said, The LORD is my rock,\r\nand my fortress, and my deliverer; 22:3 The God of my rock; in him\r\nwill I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high\r\ntower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.\r\n\r\n22:4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I\r\nbe saved from mine enemies.\r\n\r\n22:5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men\r\nmade me afraid; 22:6 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the\r\nsnares of death prevented me; 22:7 In my distress I called upon the\r\nLORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple,\r\nand my cry did enter into his ears.\r\n\r\n22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven\r\nmoved and shook, because he was wroth.\r\n\r\n22:9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his\r\nmouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.\r\n\r\n22:10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n22:11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the\r\nwings of the wind.\r\n\r\n22:12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and\r\nthick clouds of the skies.\r\n\r\n22:13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.\r\n\r\n22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n22:15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and\r\ndiscomfited them.\r\n\r\n22:16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the\r\nworld were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of\r\nthe breath of his nostrils.\r\n\r\n22:17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;\r\n22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated\r\nme: for they were too strong for me.\r\n\r\n22:19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my\r\nstay.\r\n\r\n22:20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,\r\nbecause he delighted in me.\r\n\r\n22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to\r\nthe cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.\r\n\r\n22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly\r\ndeparted from my God.\r\n\r\n22:23 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I\r\ndid not depart from them.\r\n\r\n22:24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n22:25 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my\r\nrighteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.\r\n\r\n22:26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the\r\nupright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.\r\n\r\n22:27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward\r\nthou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.\r\n\r\n22:28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon\r\nthe haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.\r\n\r\n22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n22:30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped\r\nover a wall.\r\n\r\n22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:\r\nhe is a buckler to all them that trust in him.\r\n\r\n22:32 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?\r\n22:33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.\r\n\r\n22:34 He maketh my feet like hinds\xe2\x80\x99 feet: and setteth me upon my high\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n22:35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by\r\nmine arms.\r\n\r\n22:36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy\r\ngentleness hath made me great.\r\n\r\n22:37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not\r\nslip.\r\n\r\n22:38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not\r\nagain until I had consumed them.\r\n\r\n22:39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not\r\narise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.\r\n\r\n22:40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose\r\nup against me hast thou subdued under me.\r\n\r\n22:41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might\r\ndestroy them that hate me.\r\n\r\n22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but\r\nhe answered them not.\r\n\r\n22:43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did\r\nstamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.\r\n\r\n22:44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,\r\nthou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not\r\nshall serve me.\r\n\r\n22:45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,\r\nthey shall be obedient unto me.\r\n\r\n22:46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their\r\nclose places.\r\n\r\n22:47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God\r\nof the rock of my salvation.\r\n\r\n22:48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people\r\nunder me.\r\n\r\n22:49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast\r\nlifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast\r\ndelivered me from the violent man.\r\n\r\n22:50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the\r\nheathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.\r\n\r\n22:51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to\r\nhis anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.\r\n\r\n23:1 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse\r\nsaid, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God\r\nof Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 23:2 The Spirit of\r\nthe LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.\r\n\r\n23:3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that\r\nruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.\r\n\r\n23:4 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,\r\neven a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of\r\nthe earth by clear shining after rain.\r\n\r\n23:5 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an\r\neverlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all\r\nmy salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.\r\n\r\n23:6 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust\r\naway, because they cannot be taken with hands: 23:7 But the man that\r\nshall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;\r\nand they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.\r\n\r\n23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The\r\nTachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same\r\nwas Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom\r\nhe slew at one time.\r\n\r\n23:9 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the\r\nthree mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that\r\nwere there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were\r\ngone away: 23:10 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand\r\nwas weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a\r\ngreat victory that day; and the people returned after him only to\r\nspoil.\r\n\r\n23:11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the\r\nPhilistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of\r\nground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.\r\n\r\n23:12 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and\r\nslew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.\r\n\r\n23:13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in\r\nthe harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the\r\nPhilistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.\r\n\r\n23:14 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the\r\nPhilistines was then in Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n23:15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of\r\nthe water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!  23:16 And\r\nthe three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and\r\ndrew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and\r\ntook it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink\r\nthereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:17 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:\r\nis not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?\r\ntherefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n23:18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief\r\namong three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and\r\nslew them, and had the name among three.\r\n\r\n23:19 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their\r\ncaptain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.\r\n\r\n23:20 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of\r\nKabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he\r\nwent down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:\r\n23:21 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a\r\nspear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked\r\nthe spear out of the Egyptian\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and slew him with his own spear.\r\n\r\n23:22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name\r\namong three mighty men.\r\n\r\n23:23 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to\r\nthe first three. And David set him over his guard.\r\n\r\n23:24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the\r\nson of Dodo of Bethlehem, 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the\r\nHarodite, 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\r\n23:27 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 23:28 Zalmon\r\nthe Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 23:29 Heleb the son of Baanah,\r\na Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children\r\nof Benjamin, 23:30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of\r\nGaash, 23:31 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 23:32\r\nEliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 23:33\r\nShammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 23:34\r\nEliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the\r\nson of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 23:35 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the\r\nArbite, 23:36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 23:37\r\nZelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the\r\nson of Zeruiah, 23:38 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, 23:39 Uriah\r\nthe Hittite: thirty and seven in all.\r\n\r\n24:1 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and\r\nhe moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.\r\n\r\n24:2 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with\r\nhim, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to\r\nBeersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n24:3 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the\r\npeople, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of\r\nmy lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in\r\nthis thing?  24:4 Notwithstanding the king\xe2\x80\x99s word prevailed against\r\nJoab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains\r\nof the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the\r\npeople of Israel.\r\n\r\n24:5 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right\r\nside of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and\r\ntoward Jazer: 24:6 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of\r\nTahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon, 24:7 And\r\ncame to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites,\r\nand of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even\r\nto Beersheba.\r\n\r\n24:8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to\r\nJerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.\r\n\r\n24:9 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the\r\nking: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that\r\ndrew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\n24:10 And David\xe2\x80\x99s heart smote him after that he had numbered the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAnd David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have\r\ndone: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy\r\nservant; for I have done very foolishly.\r\n\r\n24:11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came\r\nunto the prophet Gad, David\xe2\x80\x99s seer, saying, 24:12 Go and say unto\r\nDavid, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one\r\nof them, that I may do it unto thee.\r\n\r\n24:13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall\r\nseven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee\r\nthree months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that\r\nthere be three days\xe2\x80\x99 pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what\r\nanswer I shall return to him that sent me.\r\n\r\n24:14 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now\r\ninto the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not\r\nfall into the hand of man.\r\n\r\n24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even\r\nto the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to\r\nBeersheba seventy thousand men.\r\n\r\n24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to\r\ndestroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel\r\nthat destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the\r\nangel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.\r\n\r\n24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote\r\nthe people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but\r\nthese sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be\r\nagainst me, and against my father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n24:18 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear\r\nan altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.\r\n\r\n24:19 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n24:20 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on\r\ntoward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on\r\nhis face upon the ground.\r\n\r\n24:21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his\r\nservant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build\r\nan altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.\r\n\r\n24:22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer\r\nup what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt\r\nsacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen\r\nfor wood.\r\n\r\n24:23 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And\r\nAraunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.\r\n\r\n24:24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of\r\nthee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my\r\nGod of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the\r\nthreshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.\r\n\r\n24:25 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt\r\nofferings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land,\r\nand the plague was stayed from Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Book of the Kings\r\n\r\nCommonly Called:\r\n\r\nThe Third Book of the Kings\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered\r\nhim with clothes, but he gat no heat.\r\n\r\n1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my\r\nlord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and\r\nlet her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the\r\nking may get heat.\r\n\r\n1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of\r\nIsrael, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.\r\n\r\n1:4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and\r\nministered to him: but the king knew her not.\r\n\r\n1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will\r\nbe king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to\r\nrun before him.\r\n\r\n1:6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why\r\nhast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother\r\nbare him after Absalom.\r\n\r\n1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar\r\nthe priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.\r\n\r\n1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan\r\nthe prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to\r\nDavid, were not with Adonijah.\r\n\r\n1:9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of\r\nZoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsons, and all the men of Judah the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants: 1:10 But Nathan\r\nthe prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother,\r\nhe called not.\r\n\r\n1:11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,\r\nsaying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth\r\nreign, and David our lord knoweth it not?  1:12 Now therefore come,\r\nlet me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine\r\nown life, and the life of thy son Solomon.\r\n\r\n1:13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not\r\nthou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly\r\nSolomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?\r\nwhy then doth Adonijah reign?  1:14 Behold, while thou yet talkest\r\nthere with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n1:15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the\r\nking was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n1:16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the\r\nking said, What wouldest thou?  1:17 And she said unto him, My lord,\r\nthou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying,\r\nAssuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon\r\nmy throne.\r\n\r\n1:18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,\r\nthou knowest it not: 1:19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and\r\nsheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and\r\nAbiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy\r\nservant hath he not called.\r\n\r\n1:20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,\r\nthat thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord\r\nthe king after him.\r\n\r\n1:21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall\r\nsleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet\r\nalso came in.\r\n\r\n1:23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And\r\nwhen he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king\r\nwith his face to the ground.\r\n\r\n1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall\r\nreign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  1:25 For he is gone\r\ndown this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in\r\nabundance, and hath called all the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and the captains of\r\nthe host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink\r\nbefore him, and say, God save king Adonijah.\r\n\r\n1:26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah\r\nthe son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.\r\n\r\n1:27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed\r\nit unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king\r\nafter him?  1:28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba.\r\nAnd she came into the king\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and stood before the king.\r\n\r\n1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath\r\nredeemed my soul out of all distress, 1:30 Even as I sware unto thee\r\nby the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall\r\nreign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so\r\nwill I certainly do this day.\r\n\r\n1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did\r\nreverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.\r\n\r\n1:32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the\r\nprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n1:33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your\r\nlord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring\r\nhim down to Gihon: 1:34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the\r\nprophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the\r\ntrumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.\r\n\r\n1:35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my\r\nthrone; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to\r\nbe ruler over Israel and over Judah.\r\n\r\n1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,\r\nAmen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.\r\n\r\n1:37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with\r\nSolomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n1:38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son\r\nof Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and\r\ncaused Solomon to ride upon king David\xe2\x80\x99s mule, and brought him to\r\nGihon.\r\n\r\n1:39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,\r\nand anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people\r\nsaid, God save king Solomon.\r\n\r\n1:40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with\r\npipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the\r\nsound of them.\r\n\r\n1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as\r\nthey had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the\r\ntrumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an\r\nuproar?  1:42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of\r\nAbiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for\r\nthou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.\r\n\r\n1:43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king\r\nDavid hath made Solomon king.\r\n\r\n1:44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the\r\nprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the\r\nPelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king\xe2\x80\x99s mule:\r\n1:45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him\r\nking in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the\r\ncity rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.\r\n\r\n1:46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n1:47 And moreover the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants came to bless our lord king\r\nDavid, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and\r\nmake his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself\r\nupon the bed.\r\n\r\n1:48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,\r\nwhich hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even\r\nseeing it.\r\n\r\n1:49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose\r\nup, and went every man his way.\r\n\r\n1:50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and\r\ncaught hold on the horns of the altar.\r\n\r\n1:51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king\r\nSolomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,\r\nsaying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his\r\nservant with the sword.\r\n\r\n1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there\r\nshall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be\r\nfound in him, he shall die.\r\n\r\n1:53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.\r\nAnd he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto\r\nhim, Go to thine house.\r\n\r\n2:1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged\r\nSolomon his son, saying, 2:2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou\r\nstrong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 2:3 And keep the charge of\r\nthe LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his\r\ncommandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written\r\nin the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest,\r\nand whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 2:4 That the LORD may continue\r\nhis word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take\r\nheed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and\r\nwith all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the\r\nthrone of Israel.\r\n\r\n2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,\r\nand what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner\r\nthe son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and\r\nshed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his\r\ngirdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n2:6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go\r\ndown to the grave in peace.\r\n\r\n2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and\r\nlet them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me\r\nwhen I fled because of Absalom thy brother.\r\n\r\n2:8 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a\r\nBenjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day\r\nwhen I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I\r\nsware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\n2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and\r\nknowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring\r\nthou down to the grave with blood.\r\n\r\n2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:\r\nseven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned\r\nhe in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his\r\nkingdom was established greatly.\r\n\r\n2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of\r\nSolomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.\r\n\r\n2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,\r\nSay on.\r\n\r\n2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all\r\nIsrael set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom\r\nis turned about, and is become my brother\xe2\x80\x99s: for it was his from the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said\r\nunto him, Say on.\r\n\r\n2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he\r\nwill not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.\r\n\r\n2:19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for\r\nAdonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto\r\nher, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s mother; and she sat on his right hand.\r\n\r\n2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,\r\nsay me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I\r\nwill not say thee nay.\r\n\r\n2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy\r\nbrother to wife.\r\n\r\n2:22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost\r\nthou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom\r\nalso; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the\r\npriest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.\r\n\r\n2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and\r\nmore also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.\r\n\r\n2:24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and\r\nset me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an\r\nhouse, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.\r\n\r\n2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;\r\nand he fell upon him that he died.\r\n\r\n2:26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,\r\nunto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at\r\nthis time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD\r\nGod before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in\r\nall wherein my father was afflicted.\r\n\r\n2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;\r\nthat he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning\r\nthe house of Eli in Shiloh.\r\n\r\n2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,\r\nthough he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle\r\nof the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.\r\n\r\n2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the\r\ntabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon\r\nsent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.\r\n\r\n2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto\r\nhim, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die\r\nhere. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,\r\nand thus he answered me.\r\n\r\n2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon\r\nhim, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood,\r\nwhich Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.\r\n\r\n2:32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell\r\nupon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the\r\nsword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of\r\nNer, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,\r\ncaptain of the host of Judah.\r\n\r\n2:33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and\r\nupon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed,\r\nand upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever\r\nfrom the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and\r\nslew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the\r\nhost: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.\r\n\r\n2:36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build\r\nthee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence\r\nany whither.\r\n\r\n2:37 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over\r\nthe brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely\r\ndie: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.\r\n\r\n2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the\r\nking hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\n2:39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the\r\nservants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.\r\nAnd they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.\r\n\r\n2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish\r\nto seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from\r\nGath.\r\n\r\n2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to\r\nGath, and was come again.\r\n\r\n2:42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I\r\nnot make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,\r\nKnow for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any\r\nwhither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word\r\nthat I have heard is good.\r\n\r\n2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the\r\ncommandment that I have charged thee with?  2:44 The king said\r\nmoreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart\r\nis privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD\r\nshall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 2:45 And king Solomon\r\nshall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before\r\nthe LORD for ever.\r\n\r\n2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went\r\nout, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established\r\nin the hand of Solomon.\r\n\r\n3:1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took\r\nPharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he\r\nhad made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD,\r\nand the wall of Jerusalem round about.\r\n\r\n3:2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no\r\nhouse built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.\r\n\r\n3:3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his\r\nfather: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.\r\n\r\n3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the\r\ngreat high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon\r\nthat altar.\r\n\r\n3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and\r\nGod said, Ask what I shall give thee.\r\n\r\n3:6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my\r\nfather great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and\r\nin righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast\r\nkept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to\r\nsit on his throne, as it is this day.\r\n\r\n3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of\r\nDavid my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out\r\nor come in.\r\n\r\n3:8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast\r\nchosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n3:9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy\r\npeople, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to\r\njudge this thy so great a people?  3:10 And the speech pleased the\r\nLORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.\r\n\r\n3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and\r\nhast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for\r\nthyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for\r\nthyself understanding to discern judgment; 3:12 Behold, I have done\r\naccording to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an\r\nunderstanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,\r\nneither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.\r\n\r\n3:13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both\r\nriches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings\r\nlike unto thee all thy days.\r\n\r\n3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my\r\ncommandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n3:15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to\r\nJerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and\r\noffered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a\r\nfeast to all his servants.\r\n\r\n3:16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and\r\nstood before him.\r\n\r\n3:17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one\r\nhouse; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.\r\n\r\n3:18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,\r\nthat this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no\r\nstranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.\r\n\r\n3:19 And this woman\xe2\x80\x99s child died in the night; because she overlaid\r\nit.\r\n\r\n3:20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while\r\nthine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead\r\nchild in my bosom.\r\n\r\n3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it\r\nwas dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was\r\nnot my son, which I did bear.\r\n\r\n3:22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the\r\ndead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the\r\nliving is my son. Thus they spake before the king.\r\n\r\n3:23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,\r\nand thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the\r\ndead, and my son is the living.\r\n\r\n3:24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword\r\nbefore the king.\r\n\r\n3:25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half\r\nto the one, and half to the other.\r\n\r\n3:26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,\r\nfor her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her\r\nthe living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it\r\nbe neither mine nor thine, but divide it.\r\n\r\n3:27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and\r\nin no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.\r\n\r\n3:28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;\r\nand they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in\r\nhim, to do judgment.\r\n\r\n4:1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.\r\n\r\n4:2 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok\r\nthe priest, 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;\r\nJehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.\r\n\r\n4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and\r\nAbiathar were the priests: 4:5 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over\r\nthe officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s friend: 4:6 And Ahishar was over the household: and\r\nAdoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.\r\n\r\n4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided\r\nvictuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year\r\nmade provision.\r\n\r\n4:8 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9\r\nThe son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and\r\nElonbethhanan: 4:10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained\r\nSochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 4:11 The son of Abinadab, in all\r\nthe region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:\r\n4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,\r\nand all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from\r\nBethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:\r\n4:13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of\r\nJair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained\r\nthe region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with\r\nwalls and brasen bars: 4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:\r\n4:15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of\r\nSolomon to wife: 4:16 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in\r\nAloth: 4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 4:18 Shimei\r\nthe son of Elah, in Benjamin: 4:19 Geber the son of Uri was in the\r\ncountry of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and\r\nof Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n4:20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in\r\nmultitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.\r\n\r\n4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the\r\nland of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought\r\npresents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.\r\n\r\n4:22 And Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine\r\nflour, and threescore measures of meal, 4:23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty\r\noxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and\r\nroebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.\r\n\r\n4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,\r\nfrom Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:\r\nand he had peace on all sides round about him.\r\n\r\n4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and\r\nunder his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,\r\nand twelve thousand horsemen.\r\n\r\n4:27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all\r\nthat came unto king Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s table, every man in his month: they\r\nlacked nothing.\r\n\r\n4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they\r\nunto the place where the officers were, every man according to his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and\r\nlargeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.\r\n\r\n4:30 And Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of\r\nthe east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.\r\n\r\n4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and\r\nHeman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in\r\nall nations round about.\r\n\r\n4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a\r\nthousand and five.\r\n\r\n4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon\r\neven unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of\r\nbeasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.\r\n\r\n4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from\r\nall kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.\r\n\r\n5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had\r\nheard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for\r\nHiram was ever a lover of David.\r\n\r\n5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3 Thou knowest how that David\r\nmy father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God\r\nfor the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put\r\nthem under the soles of his feet.\r\n\r\n5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that\r\nthere is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.\r\n\r\n5:5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD\r\nmy God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom\r\nI will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n5:6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of\r\nLebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee\r\nwill I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt\r\nappoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can\r\nskill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.\r\n\r\n5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that\r\nhe rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which\r\nhath given unto David a wise son over this great people.\r\n\r\n5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things\r\nwhich thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning\r\ntimber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.\r\n\r\n5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I\r\nwill convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt\r\nappoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt\r\nreceive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for\r\nmy household.\r\n\r\n5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all\r\nhis desire.\r\n\r\n5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food\r\nto his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon\r\nto Hiram year by year.\r\n\r\n5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there\r\nwas peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy\r\nwas thirty thousand men.\r\n\r\n5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a\r\nmonth they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was\r\nover the levy.\r\n\r\n5:15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,\r\nand fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 5:16 Beside the chief\r\nof Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s officers which were over the work, three thousand and\r\nthree hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.\r\n\r\n5:17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly\r\nstones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.\r\n\r\n5:18 And Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s builders and Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s builders did hew them, and the\r\nstonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.\r\n\r\n6:1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after\r\nthe children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the\r\nfourth year of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is\r\nthe second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length\r\nthereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,\r\nand the height thereof thirty cubits.\r\n\r\n6:3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was\r\nthe length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten\r\ncubits was the breadth thereof before the house.\r\n\r\n6:4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.\r\n\r\n6:5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,\r\nagainst the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of\r\nthe oracle: and he made chambers round about: 6:6 The nethermost\r\nchamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad,\r\nand the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the\r\nhouse he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be\r\nfastened in the walls of the house.\r\n\r\n6:7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made\r\nready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer\r\nnor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the\r\nhouse: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,\r\nand out of the middle into the third.\r\n\r\n6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with\r\nbeams and boards of cedar.\r\n\r\n6:10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits\r\nhigh: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.\r\n\r\n6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 6:12 Concerning\r\nthis house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my\r\nstatutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to\r\nwalk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake\r\nunto David thy father: 6:13 And I will dwell among the children of\r\nIsrael, and will not forsake my people Israel.\r\n\r\n6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.\r\n\r\n6:15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,\r\nboth the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he\r\ncovered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the\r\nhouse with planks of fir.\r\n\r\n6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the\r\nfloor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it\r\nwithin, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.\r\n\r\n6:17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n6:18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open\r\nflowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.\r\n\r\n6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the\r\nark of the covenant of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and\r\ntwenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and\r\nhe overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of\r\ncedar.\r\n\r\n6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made\r\na partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid\r\nit with gold.\r\n\r\n6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished\r\nall the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\n6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each\r\nten cubits high.\r\n\r\n6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits\r\nthe other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing\r\nunto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.\r\n\r\n6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of\r\none measure and one size.\r\n\r\n6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the\r\nother cherub.\r\n\r\n6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they\r\nstretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the\r\none touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the\r\nother wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.\r\n\r\n6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved\r\nfigures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n6:30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:\r\nthe lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.\r\n\r\n6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them\r\ncarvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid\r\nthem with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a\r\nfourth part of the wall.\r\n\r\n6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one\r\ndoor were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.\r\n\r\n6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:\r\nand covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.\r\n\r\n6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and\r\na row of cedar beams.\r\n\r\n6:37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD\r\nlaid, in the month Zif: 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month\r\nBul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all\r\nthe parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he\r\nseven years in building it.\r\n\r\n7:1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he\r\nfinished all his house.\r\n\r\n7:2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length\r\nthereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,\r\nand the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,\r\nwith cedar beams upon the pillars.\r\n\r\n7:3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on\r\nforty five pillars, fifteen in a row.\r\n\r\n7:4 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light\r\nin three ranks.\r\n\r\n7:5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and\r\nlight was against light in three ranks.\r\n\r\n7:6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty\r\ncubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was\r\nbefore them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n7:7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the\r\nporch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the\r\nfloor to the other.\r\n\r\n7:8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,\r\nwhich was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.\r\n\r\n7:9 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of\r\nhewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the\r\nfoundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n7:10 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,\r\nstones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.\r\n\r\n7:11 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,\r\nand cedars.\r\n\r\n7:12 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed\r\nstones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the\r\nhouse of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.\r\n\r\n7:13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.\r\n\r\n7:14 He was a widow\xe2\x80\x99s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was\r\na man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and\r\nunderstanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to\r\nking Solomon, and wrought all his work.\r\n\r\n7:15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:\r\nand a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.\r\n\r\n7:16 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops\r\nof the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and\r\nthe height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 7:17 And nets of\r\nchecker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were\r\nupon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for\r\nthe other chapiter.\r\n\r\n7:18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one\r\nnetwork, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with\r\npomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.\r\n\r\n7:19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of\r\nlily work in the porch, four cubits.\r\n\r\n7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also\r\nabove, over against the belly which was by the network: and the\r\npomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other\r\nchapiter.\r\n\r\n7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set\r\nup the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up\r\nthe left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.\r\n\r\n7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of\r\nthe pillars finished.\r\n\r\n7:23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the\r\nother: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a\r\nline of thirty cubits did compass it round about.\r\n\r\n7:24 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing\r\nit, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were\r\ncast in two rows, when it was cast.\r\n\r\n7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and\r\nthree looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and\r\nthree looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,\r\nand all their hinder parts were inward.\r\n\r\n7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was\r\nwrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained\r\ntwo thousand baths.\r\n\r\n7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one\r\nbase, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,\r\nand the borders were between the ledges: 7:29 And on the borders that\r\nwere between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the\r\nledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were\r\ncertain additions made of thin work.\r\n\r\n7:30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and\r\nthe four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were\r\nundersetters molten, at the side of every addition.\r\n\r\n7:31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:\r\nbut the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit\r\nand an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their\r\nborders, foursquare, not round.\r\n\r\n7:32 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the\r\nwheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit\r\nand half a cubit.\r\n\r\n7:33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:\r\ntheir axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,\r\nwere all molten.\r\n\r\n7:34 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:\r\nand the undersetters were of the very base itself.\r\n\r\n7:35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a\r\ncubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the\r\nborders thereof were of the same.\r\n\r\n7:36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders\r\nthereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the\r\nproportion of every one, and additions round about.\r\n\r\n7:37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one\r\ncasting, one measure, and one size.\r\n\r\n7:38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty\r\nbaths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten\r\nbases one laver.\r\n\r\n7:39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on\r\nthe left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of\r\nthe house eastward over against the south.\r\n\r\n7:40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So\r\nHiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for\r\nthe house of the LORD: 7:41 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the\r\nchapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two\r\nnetworks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the\r\ntop of the pillars; 7:42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two\r\nnetworks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the\r\ntwo bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 7:43 And the\r\nten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 7:44 And one sea, and twelve\r\noxen under the sea; 7:45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the\r\nbasons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for\r\nthe house of the LORD, were of bright brass.\r\n\r\n7:46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground\r\nbetween Succoth and Zarthan.\r\n\r\n7:47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were\r\nexceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.\r\n\r\n7:48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of\r\nthe LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the\r\nshewbread was, 7:49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the\r\nright side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers,\r\nand the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 7:50 And the bowls, and the\r\nsnuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure\r\ngold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house,\r\nthe most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n7:51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of\r\nthe LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had\r\ndedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put\r\namong the treasures of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of\r\nthe tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto\r\nking Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the\r\ncovenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.\r\n\r\n8:2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon\r\nat the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.\r\n\r\n8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the\r\nark.\r\n\r\n8:4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,\r\neven those did the priests and the Levites bring up.\r\n\r\n8:5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were\r\nassembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep\r\nand oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.\r\n\r\n8:6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD\r\nunto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,\r\neven under the wings of the cherubims.\r\n\r\n8:7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of\r\nthe ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n8:8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were\r\nseen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen\r\nwithout: and there they are unto this day.\r\n\r\n8:9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which\r\nMoses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the\r\nchildren of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy\r\nplace, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 8:11 So that the\r\npriests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the\r\nglory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the\r\nthick darkness.\r\n\r\n8:13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place\r\nfor thee to abide in for ever.\r\n\r\n8:14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the\r\ncongregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)\r\n8:15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with\r\nhis mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,\r\nsaying, 8:16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out\r\nof Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an\r\nhouse, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my\r\npeople Israel.\r\n\r\n8:17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for\r\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n8:18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine\r\nheart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in\r\nthine heart.\r\n\r\n8:19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that\r\nshall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my\r\nname.\r\n\r\n8:20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am\r\nrisen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of\r\nIsrael, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of\r\nthe LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant\r\nof the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out\r\nof the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of\r\nall the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward\r\nheaven: 8:23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like\r\nthee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and\r\nmercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:\r\n8:24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou\r\npromisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled\r\nit with thine hand, as it is this day.\r\n\r\n8:25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my\r\nfather that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a\r\nman in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children\r\ntake heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n8:26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,\r\nwhich thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.\r\n\r\n8:27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and\r\nheaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I\r\nhave builded?  8:28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy\r\nservant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the\r\ncry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:\r\n8:29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even\r\ntoward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that\r\nthou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make\r\ntoward this place.\r\n\r\n8:30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy\r\npeople Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou\r\nin heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.\r\n\r\n8:31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid\r\nupon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar\r\nin this house: 8:32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy\r\nservants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and\r\njustifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.\r\n\r\n8:33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because\r\nthey have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and\r\nconfess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this\r\nhouse: 8:34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy\r\npeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest\r\nunto their fathers.\r\n\r\n8:35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have\r\nsinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy\r\nname, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 8:36 Then\r\nhear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy\r\npeople Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should\r\nwalk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people\r\nfor an inheritance.\r\n\r\n8:37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,\r\nmildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege\r\nthem in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever\r\nsickness there be; 8:38 What prayer and supplication soever be made by\r\nany man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the\r\nplague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:\r\n8:39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,\r\nand give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest;\r\n(for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of\r\nmen;) 8:40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the\r\nland which thou gavest unto our fathers.\r\n\r\n8:41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,\r\nbut cometh out of a far country for thy name\xe2\x80\x99s sake; 8:42 (For they\r\nshall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy\r\nstretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;\r\n8:43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all\r\nthat the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth\r\nmay know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that\r\nthey may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy\r\nname.\r\n\r\n8:44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever\r\nthou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city\r\nwhich thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy\r\nname: 8:45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their\r\nsupplication, and maintain their cause.\r\n\r\n8:46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)\r\nand thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that\r\nthey carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;\r\n8:47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they\r\nwere carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in\r\nthe land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned,\r\nand have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 8:48 And so\r\nreturn unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the\r\nland of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee\r\ntoward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city\r\nwhich thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:\r\n8:49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy\r\ndwelling place, and maintain their cause, 8:50 And forgive thy people\r\nthat have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein\r\nthey have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before\r\nthem who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:\r\n8:51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou\r\nbroughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:\r\n8:52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,\r\nand unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them\r\nin all that they call for unto thee.\r\n\r\n8:53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the\r\nearth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses\r\nthy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n8:54 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all\r\nthis prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the\r\naltar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up\r\nto heaven.\r\n\r\n8:55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a\r\nloud voice, saying, 8:56 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest\r\nunto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath\r\nnot failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the\r\nhand of Moses his servant.\r\n\r\n8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him\r\nnot leave us, nor forsake us: 8:58 That he may incline our hearts unto\r\nhim, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his\r\nstatutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.\r\n\r\n8:59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before\r\nthe LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he\r\nmaintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel\r\nat all times, as the matter shall require: 8:60 That all the people of\r\nthe earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.\r\n\r\n8:61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to\r\nwalk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.\r\n\r\n8:62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he\r\noffered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred\r\nand twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel\r\ndedicated the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was\r\nbefore the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings,\r\nand meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the\r\nbrasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the\r\nburnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\n8:65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a\r\ngreat congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of\r\nEgypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even\r\nfourteen days.\r\n\r\n8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the\r\nking, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the\r\ngoodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\n9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the\r\nhouse of the LORD, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and all Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s desire\r\nwhich he was pleased to do, 9:2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the\r\nsecond time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.\r\n\r\n9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\r\nsupplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\r\nhouse, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\r\neyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.\r\n\r\n9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in\r\nintegrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I\r\nhave commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 9:5\r\nThen I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,\r\nas I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a\r\nman upon the throne of Israel.\r\n\r\n9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your\r\nchildren, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I\r\nhave set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:\r\n9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given\r\nthem; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast\r\nout of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all\r\npeople: 9:8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth\r\nby it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why\r\nhath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?  9:9 And\r\nthey shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who\r\nbrought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken\r\nhold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:\r\ntherefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.\r\n\r\n9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had\r\nbuilt the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\n9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar\r\ntrees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that\r\nthen king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.\r\n\r\n9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had\r\ngiven him; and they pleased him not.\r\n\r\n9:13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my\r\nbrother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.\r\n\r\n9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.\r\n\r\n9:15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for\r\nto build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the\r\nwall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.\r\n\r\n9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt\r\nit with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and\r\ngiven it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18 And\r\nBaalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 9:19 And all the\r\ncities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and\r\ncities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in\r\nJerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\r\n\r\n9:20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,\r\nPerizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of\r\nIsrael, 9:21 Their children that were left after them in the land,\r\nwhom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy,\r\nupon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.\r\n\r\n9:22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but\r\nthey were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his\r\ncaptains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.\r\n\r\n9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that\r\nwrought in the work.\r\n\r\n9:24 But Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her\r\nhouse which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.\r\n\r\n9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and\r\npeace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he\r\nburnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is\r\nbeside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.\r\n\r\n9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had\r\nknowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.\r\n\r\n9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four\r\nhundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.\r\n\r\n10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon\r\nconcerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels\r\nthat bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when\r\nshe was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n10:3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing\r\nhid from the king, which he told her not.\r\n\r\n10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom, and\r\nthe house that he had built, 10:5 And the meat of his table, and the\r\nsitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and\r\ntheir apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up\r\nunto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.\r\n\r\n10:6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in\r\nmine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.\r\n\r\n10:7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had\r\nseen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and\r\nprosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.\r\n\r\n10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand\r\ncontinually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.\r\n\r\n10:9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee\r\non the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever,\r\ntherefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.\r\n\r\n10:10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and\r\nof spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more\r\nsuch abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to\r\nking Solomon.\r\n\r\n10:11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,\r\nbrought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n10:12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of\r\nthe LORD, and for the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, harps also and psalteries for\r\nsingers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.\r\n\r\n10:13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,\r\nwhatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal\r\nbounty.\r\n\r\nSo she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.\r\n\r\n10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six\r\nhundred threescore and six talents of gold, 10:15 Beside that he had\r\nof the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of\r\nall the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.\r\n\r\n10:16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six\r\nhundred shekels of gold went to one target.\r\n\r\n10:17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of\r\ngold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the\r\nforest of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n10:18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it\r\nwith the best gold.\r\n\r\n10:19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round\r\nbehind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,\r\nand two lions stood beside the stays.\r\n\r\n10:20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other\r\nupon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.\r\n\r\n10:21 And all king Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s drinking vessels were of gold, and all\r\nthe vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;\r\nnone were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of\r\nHiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold,\r\nand silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\r\n\r\n10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches\r\nand for wisdom.\r\n\r\n10:24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which\r\nGod had put in his heart.\r\n\r\n10:25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and\r\nvessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and\r\nmules, a rate year by year.\r\n\r\n10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had\r\na thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,\r\nwhom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and\r\ncedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\r\n\r\n10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred\r\nshekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for\r\nall the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they\r\nbring them out by their means.\r\n\r\n11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the\r\ndaughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,\r\nZidonians, and Hittites: 11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORD\r\nsaid unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither\r\nshall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart\r\nafter their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.\r\n\r\n11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred\r\nconcubines: and his wives turned away his heart.\r\n\r\n11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned\r\naway his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with\r\nthe LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.\r\n\r\n11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,\r\nand after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\r\n\r\n11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully\r\nafter the LORD, as did David his father.\r\n\r\n11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination\r\nof Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the\r\nabomination of the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt\r\nincense and sacrificed unto their gods.\r\n\r\n11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned\r\nfrom the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 11:10\r\nAnd had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go\r\nafter other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.\r\n\r\n11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done\r\nof thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I\r\nhave commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and\r\nwill give it to thy servant.\r\n\r\n11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.\r\n\r\n11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one\r\ntribe to thy son for David my servant\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and for Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\nwhich I have chosen.\r\n\r\n11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the\r\nEdomite: he was of the king\xe2\x80\x99s seed in Edom.\r\n\r\n11:15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the\r\ncaptain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had\r\nsmitten every male in Edom; 11:16 (For six months did Joab remain\r\nthere with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 11:17\r\nThat Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father\xe2\x80\x99s servants with\r\nhim, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.\r\n\r\n11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took\r\nmen with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king\r\nof Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and\r\ngave him land.\r\n\r\n11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he\r\ngave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\n11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom\r\nTahpenes weaned in Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold among the sons of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n11:21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,\r\nand that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,\r\nLet me depart, that I may go to mine own country.\r\n\r\n11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,\r\nthat, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he\r\nanswered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.\r\n\r\n11:23 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of\r\nEliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 11:24 And\r\nhe gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David\r\nslew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and\r\nreigned in Damascus.\r\n\r\n11:25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,\r\nbeside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and\r\nreigned over Syria.\r\n\r\n11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,\r\nSolomon\xe2\x80\x99s servant, whose mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even\r\nhe lifted up his hand against the king.\r\n\r\n11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the\r\nking: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of\r\nDavid his father.\r\n\r\n11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon\r\nseeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over\r\nall the charge of the house of Joseph.\r\n\r\n11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of\r\nJerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;\r\nand he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in\r\nthe field: 11:30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him,\r\nand rent it in twelve pieces: 11:31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee\r\nten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will\r\nrend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes\r\nto thee: 11:32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, and for Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x99s sake, the city which I have chosen out of\r\nall the tribes of Israel:) 11:33 Because that they have forsaken me,\r\nand have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh\r\nthe god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,\r\nand have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine\r\neyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I\r\nwill make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:\r\n11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and will give\r\nit unto thee, even ten tribes.\r\n\r\n11:36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant\r\nmay have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have\r\nchosen me to put my name there.\r\n\r\n11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that\r\nthy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.\r\n\r\n11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command\r\nthee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to\r\nkeep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I\r\nwill be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,\r\nand will give Israel unto thee.\r\n\r\n11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.\r\n\r\n11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,\r\nand fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt\r\nuntil the death of Solomon.\r\n\r\n11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and\r\nhis wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?\r\n11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel\r\nwas forty years.\r\n\r\n11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city\r\nof David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n12:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem\r\nto make him king.\r\n\r\n12:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet\r\nin Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king\r\nSolomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 12:3 That they sent and called\r\nhim. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake\r\nunto Rehoboam, saying, 12:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now\r\ntherefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy\r\nyoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.\r\n\r\n12:5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again\r\nto me. And the people departed.\r\n\r\n12:6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before\r\nSolomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that\r\nI may answer this people?  12:7 And they spake unto him, saying, If\r\nthou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them,\r\nand answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy\r\nservants for ever.\r\n\r\n12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given\r\nhim, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and\r\nwhich stood before him: 12:9 And he said unto them, What counsel give\r\nye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make\r\nthe yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?  12:10 And the\r\nyoung men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus\r\nshalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy\r\nfather made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus\r\nshalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s loins.\r\n\r\n12:11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will\r\nadd to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will\r\nchastise you with scorpions.\r\n\r\n12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,\r\nas the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.\r\n\r\n12:13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s counsel that they gave him; 12:14 And spake to them after the\r\ncounsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and\r\nI will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but\r\nI will chastise you with scorpions.\r\n\r\n12:15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause\r\nwas from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD\r\nspake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\r\n\r\n12:16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,\r\nthe people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?\r\nneither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O\r\nIsrael: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto\r\ntheir tents.\r\n\r\n12:17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of\r\nJudah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\r\n\r\n12:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and\r\nall Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king\r\nRehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.\r\n\r\n12:20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was\r\ncome again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and\r\nmade him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house\r\nof David, but the tribe of Judah only.\r\n\r\n12:21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the\r\nhouse of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore\r\nthousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house\r\nof Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.\r\n\r\n12:22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\r\n12:23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto\r\nall the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,\r\nsaying, 12:24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight\r\nagainst your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his\r\nhouse; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word\r\nof the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;\r\nand went out from thence, and built Penuel.\r\n\r\n12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to\r\nthe house of David: 12:27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the\r\nhouse of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people\r\nturn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they\r\nshall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.\r\n\r\n12:28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,\r\nand said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:\r\nbehold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.\r\n\r\n12:30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship\r\nbefore the one, even unto Dan.\r\n\r\n12:31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the\r\nlowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.\r\n\r\n12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the\r\nfifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and\r\nhe offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the\r\ncalves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the\r\nhigh places which he had made.\r\n\r\n12:33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the\r\nfifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had\r\ndevised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of\r\nIsrael: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.\r\n\r\n13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of\r\nthe LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.\r\n\r\n13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,\r\nO altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born\r\nunto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer\r\nthe priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbones shall be burnt upon thee.\r\n\r\n13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which\r\nthe LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes\r\nthat are upon it shall be poured out.\r\n\r\n13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the\r\nman of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put\r\nforth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,\r\nwhich he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it\r\nin again to him.\r\n\r\n13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,\r\naccording to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now\r\nthe face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be\r\nrestored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.\r\n\r\n13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and\r\nrefresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.\r\n\r\n13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half\r\nthine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor\r\ndrink water in this place: 13:9 For so was it charged me by the word\r\nof the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by\r\nthe same way that thou camest.\r\n\r\n13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came\r\nto Bethel.\r\n\r\n13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and\r\ntold him all the works that the man of God had done that day in\r\nBethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told\r\nalso to their father.\r\n\r\n13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons\r\nhad seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.\r\n\r\n13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled\r\nhim the ass: and he rode thereon, 13:14 And went after the man of God,\r\nand found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the\r\nman of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.\r\n\r\n13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.\r\n\r\n13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:\r\nneither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:\r\n13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no\r\nbread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou\r\ncamest.\r\n\r\n13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel\r\nspake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with\r\nthee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he\r\nlied unto him.\r\n\r\n13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and\r\ndrank water.\r\n\r\n13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of\r\nthe LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 13:21 And he\r\ncried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the\r\nLORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast\r\nnot kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 13:22\r\nBut camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of\r\nthe which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;\r\nthy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.\r\n\r\n13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had\r\ndrunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom\r\nhe had brought back.\r\n\r\n13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:\r\nand his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion\r\nalso stood by the carcase.\r\n\r\n13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,\r\nand the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the\r\ncity where the old prophet dwelt.\r\n\r\n13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard\r\nthereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the\r\nword of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,\r\nwhich hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,\r\nwhich he spake unto him.\r\n\r\n13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they\r\nsaddled him.\r\n\r\n13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass\r\nand the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the\r\ncarcase, nor torn the ass.\r\n\r\n13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid\r\nit upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the\r\ncity, to mourn and to bury him.\r\n\r\n13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over\r\nhim, saying, Alas, my brother!  13:31 And it came to pass, after he\r\nhad buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead,\r\nthen bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my\r\nbones beside his bones: 13:32 For the saying which he cried by the\r\nword of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the\r\nhouses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall\r\nsurely come to pass.\r\n\r\n13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but\r\nmade again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:\r\nwhosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests\r\nof the high places.\r\n\r\n13:34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to\r\ncut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.\r\n\r\n14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise\r\nthyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get\r\nthee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me\r\nthat I should be king over this people.\r\n\r\n14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of\r\nhoney, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n14:4 And Jeroboam\xe2\x80\x99s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and\r\ncame to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes\r\nwere set by reason of his age.\r\n\r\n14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam\r\ncometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and\r\nthus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in,\r\nthat she shall feign herself to be another woman.\r\n\r\n14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she\r\ncame in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why\r\nfeignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\n14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch\r\nas I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my\r\npeople Israel, 14:8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David,\r\nand gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who\r\nkept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do\r\nthat only which was right in mine eyes; 14:9 But hast done evil above\r\nall that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other\r\ngods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me\r\nbehind thy back: 14:10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the\r\nhouse of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth\r\nagainst the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will\r\ntake away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away\r\ndung, till it be all gone.\r\n\r\n14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and\r\nhim that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the\r\nLORD hath spoken it.\r\n\r\n14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy\r\nfeet enter into the city, the child shall die.\r\n\r\n14:13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of\r\nJeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some\r\ngood thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n14:14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who\r\nshall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.\r\n\r\n14:15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the\r\nwater, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he\r\ngave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river,\r\nbecause they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.\r\n\r\n14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who\r\ndid sin, and who made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n14:17 And Jeroboam\xe2\x80\x99s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and\r\nwhen she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 14:18 And\r\nthey buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word\r\nof the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\n14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he\r\nreigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the\r\nkings of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:\r\nand he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was\r\nforty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\nseventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out\r\nof all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was Naamah an Ammonitess.\r\n\r\n14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked\r\nhim to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all\r\nthat their fathers had done.\r\n\r\n14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on\r\nevery high hill, and under every green tree.\r\n\r\n14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did\r\naccording to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast\r\nout before the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that\r\nShishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 14:26 And he took\r\naway the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields\r\nof gold which Solomon had made.\r\n\r\n14:27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and\r\ncommitted them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept\r\nthe door of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,\r\nthat the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\r\n14:30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.\r\n\r\n14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\r\nfathers in the city of David. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Naamah an\r\nAmmonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat\r\nreigned Abijam over Judah.\r\n\r\n15:2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nMaachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\r\n\r\n15:3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done\r\nbefore him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as\r\nthe heart of David his father.\r\n\r\n15:4 Nevertheless for David\xe2\x80\x99s sake did the LORD his God give him a\r\nlamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish\r\nJerusalem: 15:5 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of\r\nthe LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him\r\nall the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the\r\nHittite.\r\n\r\n15:6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n15:7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they\r\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And\r\nthere was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n15:8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the\r\ncity of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa\r\nover Judah.\r\n\r\n15:10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\r\n\r\n15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did\r\nDavid his father.\r\n\r\n15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all\r\nthe idols that his fathers had made.\r\n\r\n15:13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being\r\nqueen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her\r\nidol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.\r\n\r\n15:14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwas perfect with the LORD all his days.\r\n\r\n15:15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and\r\nthe things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD,\r\nsilver, and gold, and vessels.\r\n\r\n15:16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all\r\ntheir days.\r\n\r\n15:17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built\r\nRamah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king\r\nof Judah.\r\n\r\n15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the\r\ntreasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa\r\nsent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of\r\nSyria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 15:19 There is a league between\r\nme and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent\r\nunto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with\r\nBaasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\r\n\r\n15:20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of\r\nthe hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon,\r\nand Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of\r\nNaphtali.\r\n\r\n15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off\r\nbuilding of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.\r\n\r\n15:22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was\r\nexempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber\r\nthereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them\r\nGeba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.\r\n\r\n15:23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that\r\nhe did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the\r\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time\r\nof his old age he was diseased in his feet.\r\n\r\n15:24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers\r\nin the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\n15:25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the\r\nsecond year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.\r\n\r\n15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way\r\nof his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n15:27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,\r\nconspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which\r\nbelonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to\r\nGibbethon.\r\n\r\n15:28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,\r\nand reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the\r\nhouse of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he\r\nhad destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he\r\nspake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 15:30 Because of the sins\r\nof Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his\r\nprovocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.\r\n\r\n15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they\r\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\r\n15:32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all\r\ntheir days.\r\n\r\n15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of\r\nAhijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.\r\n\r\n15:34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way\r\nof Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against\r\nBaasha, saying, 16:2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and\r\nmade thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the\r\nway of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me\r\nto anger with their sins; 16:3 Behold, I will take away the posterity\r\nof Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house\r\nlike the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\r\n\r\n16:4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him\r\nthat dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.\r\n\r\n16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his\r\nmight, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings\r\nof Israel?  16:6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in\r\nTirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n16:7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came\r\nthe word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for\r\nall the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to\r\nanger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam;\r\nand because he killed him.\r\n\r\n16:8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the\r\nson of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.\r\n\r\n16:9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired\r\nagainst him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house\r\nof Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.\r\n\r\n16:10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty\r\nand seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n16:11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat\r\non his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not\r\none that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n16:12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the\r\nword of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.\r\n\r\n16:13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by\r\nwhich they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking\r\nthe LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.\r\n\r\n16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they\r\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\r\n16:15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri\r\nreign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against\r\nGibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.\r\n\r\n16:16 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath\r\nconspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made\r\nOmri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.\r\n\r\n16:17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and\r\nthey besieged Tirzah.\r\n\r\n16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,\r\nthat he went into the palace of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and burnt the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse over him with fire, and died.\r\n\r\n16:19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the\r\nLORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did,\r\nto make Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he\r\nwrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\r\nkings of Israel?  16:21 Then were the people of Israel divided into\r\ntwo parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to\r\nmake him king; and half followed Omri.\r\n\r\n16:22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people\r\nthat followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri\r\nreigned.\r\n\r\n16:23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to\r\nreign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.\r\n\r\n16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of\r\nsilver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which\r\nhe built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.\r\n\r\n16:25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse\r\nthan all that were before him.\r\n\r\n16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and\r\nin his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of\r\nIsrael to anger with their vanities.\r\n\r\n16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might\r\nthat he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of\r\nthe kings of Israel?  16:28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was\r\nburied in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n16:29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began\r\nAhab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri\r\nreigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.\r\n\r\n16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above\r\nall that were before him.\r\n\r\n16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to\r\nwalk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife\r\nJezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and\r\nserved Baal, and worshipped him.\r\n\r\n16:32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which\r\nhe had built in Samaria.\r\n\r\n16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God\r\nof Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.\r\n\r\n16:34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the\r\nfoundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates\r\nthereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD,\r\nwhich he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.\r\n\r\n17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,\r\nsaid unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,\r\nthere shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.\r\n\r\n17:2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:3 Get thee\r\nhence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,\r\nthat is before Jordan.\r\n\r\n17:4 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have\r\ncommanded the ravens to feed thee there.\r\n\r\n17:5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he\r\nwent and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.\r\n\r\n17:6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and\r\nbread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.\r\n\r\n17:7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,\r\nbecause there had been no rain in the land.\r\n\r\n17:8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:9 Arise, get\r\nthee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold,\r\nI have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.\r\n\r\n17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate\r\nof the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks:\r\nand he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water\r\nin a vessel, that I may drink.\r\n\r\n17:11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,\r\nBring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.\r\n\r\n17:12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but\r\nan handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and,\r\nbehold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for\r\nme and my son, that we may eat it, and die.\r\n\r\n17:13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:\r\nbut make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and\r\nafter make for thee and for thy son.\r\n\r\n17:14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall\r\nnot waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the\r\nLORD sendeth rain upon the earth.\r\n\r\n17:15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,\r\nand he, and her house, did eat many days.\r\n\r\n17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil\r\nfail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.\r\n\r\n17:17 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the\r\nwoman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so\r\nsore, that there was no breath left in him.\r\n\r\n17:18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou\r\nman of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and\r\nto slay my son?  17:19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he\r\ntook him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he\r\nabode, and laid him upon his own bed.\r\n\r\n17:20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou\r\nalso brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her\r\nson?  17:21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and\r\ncried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s soul come into him again.\r\n\r\n17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the\r\nchild came into him again, and he revived.\r\n\r\n17:23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the\r\nchamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah\r\nsaid, See, thy son liveth.\r\n\r\n17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a\r\nman of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.\r\n\r\n18:1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD\r\ncame to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab;\r\nand I will send rain upon the earth.\r\n\r\n18:2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore\r\nfamine in Samaria.\r\n\r\n18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.\r\n(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 18:4 For it was so, when Jezebel\r\ncut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred\r\nprophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and\r\nwater.)  18:5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all\r\nfountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find\r\ngrass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\n18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab\r\nwent one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.\r\n\r\n18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he\r\nknew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord\r\nElijah?  18:8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold,\r\nElijah is here.\r\n\r\n18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy\r\nservant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  18:10 As the LORD thy God\r\nliveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent\r\nto seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of\r\nthe kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.\r\n\r\n18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\r\n\r\n18:12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that\r\nthe Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so\r\nwhen I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me:\r\nbut I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.\r\n\r\n18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the\r\nprophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s prophets\r\nby fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  18:14 And now\r\nthou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall\r\nslay me.\r\n\r\n18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I\r\nstand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.\r\n\r\n18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to\r\nmeet Elijah.\r\n\r\n18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto\r\nhim, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  18:18 And he answered, I have\r\nnot troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house, in that ye have\r\nforsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.\r\n\r\n18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount\r\nCarmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the\r\nprophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the\r\nprophets together unto mount Carmel.\r\n\r\n18:21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye\r\nbetween two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal,\r\nthen follow him. And the people answered him not a word.\r\n\r\n18:22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a\r\nprophet of the LORD; but Baal\xe2\x80\x99s prophets are four hundred and fifty\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n18:23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one\r\nbullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and\r\nput no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on\r\nwood, and put no fire under: 18:24 And call ye on the name of your\r\ngods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that\r\nanswereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and\r\nsaid, It is well spoken.\r\n\r\n18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one\r\nbullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call\r\non the name of your gods, but put no fire under.\r\n\r\n18:26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed\r\nit, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,\r\nsaying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that\r\nanswered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.\r\n\r\n18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,\r\nCry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,\r\nor he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be\r\nawaked.\r\n\r\n18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with\r\nknives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.\r\n\r\n18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied\r\nuntil the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there\r\nwas neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.\r\n\r\n18:30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all\r\nthe people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD\r\nthat was broken down.\r\n\r\n18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the\r\ntribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,\r\nsaying, Israel shall be thy name: 18:32 And with the stones he built\r\nan altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the\r\naltar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.\r\n\r\n18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and\r\nlaid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour\r\nit on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.\r\n\r\n18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnd he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.\r\n\r\n18:35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the\r\ntrench also with water.\r\n\r\n18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening\r\nsacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of\r\nAbraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art\r\nGod in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all\r\nthese things at thy word.\r\n\r\n18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou\r\nart the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.\r\n\r\n18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt\r\nsacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up\r\nthe water that was in the trench.\r\n\r\n18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and\r\nthey said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.\r\n\r\n18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not\r\none of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down\r\nto the brook Kishon, and slew them there.\r\n\r\n18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there\r\nis a sound of abundance of rain.\r\n\r\n18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the\r\ntop of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his\r\nface between his knees, 18:43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look\r\ntoward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is\r\nnothing. And he said, Go again seven times.\r\n\r\n18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,\r\nthere ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand. And he\r\nsaid, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down\r\nthat the rain stop thee not.\r\n\r\n18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black\r\nwith clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and\r\nwent to Jezreel.\r\n\r\n18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his\r\nloins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\r\n\r\n19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he\r\nhad slain all the prophets with the sword.\r\n\r\n19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the\r\ngods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of\r\none of them by to morrow about this time.\r\n\r\n19:3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came\r\nto Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.\r\n\r\n19:4 But he himself went a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey into the wilderness, and came\r\nand sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that\r\nhe might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life;\r\nfor I am not better than my fathers.\r\n\r\n19:5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an\r\nangel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.\r\n\r\n19:6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,\r\nand a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid\r\nhim down again.\r\n\r\n19:7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched\r\nhim, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n19:8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of\r\nthat meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.\r\n\r\n19:9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,\r\nthe word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest\r\nthou here, Elijah?  19:10 And he said, I have been very jealous for\r\nthe LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy\r\ncovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the\r\nsword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it\r\naway.\r\n\r\n19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.\r\n\r\nAnd, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the\r\nmountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD\r\nwas not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD\r\nwas not in the earthquake: 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; but\r\nthe LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\r\n\r\n19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in\r\nhis mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.\r\nAnd, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou\r\nhere, Elijah?  19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the\r\nLORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy\r\ncovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the\r\nsword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it\r\naway.\r\n\r\n19:15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the\r\nwilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king\r\nover Syria: 19:16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be\r\nking over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt\r\nthou anoint to be prophet in thy room.\r\n\r\n19:17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of\r\nHazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu\r\nshall Elisha slay.\r\n\r\n19:18 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which\r\nhave not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.\r\n\r\n19:19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who\r\nwas plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the\r\ntwelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.\r\n\r\n19:20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I\r\npray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.\r\nAnd he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?\r\n19:21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew\r\nthem, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and\r\ngave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after\r\nElijah, and ministered unto him.\r\n\r\n20:1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:\r\nand there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and\r\nchariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.\r\n\r\n20:2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and\r\nsaid unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 20:3 Thy silver and thy gold is\r\nmine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.\r\n\r\n20:4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,\r\naccording to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.\r\n\r\n20:5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,\r\nsaying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me\r\nthy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 20:6 Yet I\r\nwill send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they\r\nshall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall\r\nbe, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in\r\ntheir hand, and take it away.\r\n\r\n20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and\r\nsaid, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he\r\nsent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and\r\nfor my gold; and I denied him not.\r\n\r\n20:8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not\r\nunto him, nor consent.\r\n\r\n20:9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord\r\nthe king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I\r\nwill do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and\r\nbrought him word again.\r\n\r\n20:10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,\r\nand more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for\r\nall the people that follow me.\r\n\r\n20:11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him\r\nthat girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.\r\n\r\n20:12 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he\r\nwas drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his\r\nservants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array\r\nagainst the city.\r\n\r\n20:13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,\r\nsaying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?\r\nbehold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt\r\nknow that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even\r\nby the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who\r\nshall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.\r\n\r\n20:15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,\r\nand they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered\r\nall the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.\r\n\r\n20:16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself\r\ndrunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings\r\nthat helped him.\r\n\r\n20:17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out\r\nfirst; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men\r\ncome out of Samaria.\r\n\r\n20:18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them\r\nalive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.\r\n\r\n20:19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of\r\nthe city, and the army which followed them.\r\n\r\n20:20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and\r\nIsrael pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an\r\nhorse with the horsemen.\r\n\r\n20:21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and\r\nchariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.\r\n\r\n20:22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,\r\nGo, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the\r\nreturn of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.\r\n\r\n20:23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods\r\nare gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let\r\nus fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger\r\nthan they.\r\n\r\n20:24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his\r\nplace, and put captains in their rooms: 20:25 And number thee an army,\r\nlike the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for\r\nchariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we\r\nshall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n20:26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad\r\nnumbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.\r\n\r\n20:27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,\r\nand went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them\r\nlike two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.\r\n\r\n20:28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,\r\nand said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD\r\nis God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will\r\nI deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know\r\nthat I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so\r\nit was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the\r\nchildren of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in\r\none day.\r\n\r\n20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell\r\nupon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad\r\nfled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.\r\n\r\n20:31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that\r\nthe kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray\r\nthee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out\r\nto the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.\r\n\r\n20:32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their\r\nheads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad\r\nsaith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is\r\nmy brother.\r\n\r\n20:33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come\r\nfrom him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother\r\nBenhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to\r\nhim; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.\r\n\r\n20:34 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took\r\nfrom thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee\r\nin Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send\r\nthee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent\r\nhim away.\r\n\r\n20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his\r\nneighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man\r\nrefused to smite him.\r\n\r\n20:36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of\r\nthe LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall\r\nslay thee.\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n20:37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And\r\nthe man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.\r\n\r\n20:38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and\r\ndisguised himself with ashes upon his face.\r\n\r\n20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,\r\nThy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man\r\nturned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if\r\nby any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or\r\nelse thou shalt pay a talent of silver.\r\n\r\n20:40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the\r\nking of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast\r\ndecided it.\r\n\r\n20:41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the\r\nking of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.\r\n\r\n20:42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let\r\ngo out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,\r\ntherefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n20:43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,\r\nand came to Samaria.\r\n\r\n21:1 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the\r\nJezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of\r\nAhab king of Samaria.\r\n\r\n21:2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I\r\nmay have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:\r\nand I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem\r\ngood to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.\r\n\r\n21:3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should\r\ngive the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.\r\n\r\n21:4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the\r\nword which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I\r\nwill not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down\r\nupon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.\r\n\r\n21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy\r\nspirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?  21:6 And he said unto her,\r\nBecause I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me\r\nthy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee\r\nanother vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my\r\nvineyard.\r\n\r\n21:7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the\r\nkingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry:\r\nI will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\r\n\r\n21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab\xe2\x80\x99s name, and sealed them with his\r\nseal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were\r\nin his city, dwelling with Naboth.\r\n\r\n21:9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set\r\nNaboth on high among the people: 21:10 And set two men, sons of\r\nBelial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst\r\nblaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him,\r\nthat he may die.\r\n\r\n21:11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were\r\nthe inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as\r\nit was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.\r\n\r\n21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.\r\n\r\n21:13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before\r\nhim: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth,\r\nin the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and\r\nthe king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him\r\nwith stones, that he died.\r\n\r\n21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,\r\nand was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the\r\nvineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for\r\nmoney: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.\r\n\r\n21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that\r\nAhab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to\r\ntake possession of it.\r\n\r\n21:17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\r\n21:18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:\r\nbehold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to\r\npossess it.\r\n\r\n21:19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast\r\nthou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,\r\nsaying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood\r\nof Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.\r\n\r\n21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And\r\nhe answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work\r\nevil in the sight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy\r\nposterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the\r\nwall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 21:22 And will make\r\nthine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the\r\nhouse of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou\r\nhast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n21:23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat\r\nJezebel by the wall of Jezreel.\r\n\r\n21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him\r\nthat dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.\r\n\r\n21:25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to\r\nwork wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife\r\nstirred up.\r\n\r\n21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all\r\nthings as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent\r\nhis clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in\r\nsackcloth, and went softly.\r\n\r\n21:28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,\r\n21:29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he\r\nhumbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but\r\nin his son\xe2\x80\x99s days will I bring the evil upon his house.\r\n\r\n22:1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king\r\nof Judah came down to the king of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that\r\nRamoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the\r\nhand of the king of Syria?  22:4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt\r\nthou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the\r\nking of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses\r\nas thy horses.\r\n\r\n22:5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray\r\nthee, at the word of the LORD to day.\r\n\r\n22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about\r\nfour hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead\r\nto battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD\r\nshall deliver it into the hand of the king.\r\n\r\n22:7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD\r\nbesides, that we might enquire of him?  22:8 And the king of Israel\r\nsaid unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah,\r\nby whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not\r\nprophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not\r\nthe king say so.\r\n\r\n22:9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten\r\nhither Micaiah the son of Imlah.\r\n\r\n22:10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat\r\neach on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the\r\nentrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n22:11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he\r\nsaid, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians,\r\nuntil thou have consumed them.\r\n\r\n22:12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to\r\nRamothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,\r\nsaying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the\r\nking with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of\r\none of them, and speak that which is good.\r\n\r\n22:14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto\r\nme, that will I speak.\r\n\r\n22:15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,\r\nshall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And\r\nhe answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into\r\nthe hand of the king.\r\n\r\n22:16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee\r\nthat thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the\r\nLORD?  22:17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills,\r\nas sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no\r\nmaster: let them return every man to his house in peace.\r\n\r\n22:18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell\r\nthee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?  22:19\r\nAnd he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD\r\nsitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on\r\nhis right hand and on his left.\r\n\r\n22:20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up\r\nand fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another\r\nsaid on that manner.\r\n\r\n22:21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and\r\nsaid, I will persuade him.\r\n\r\n22:22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go\r\nforth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.\r\nAnd he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n22:23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the\r\nmouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil\r\nconcerning thee.\r\n\r\n22:24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah\r\non the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me\r\nto speak unto thee?  22:25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in\r\nthat day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.\r\n\r\n22:26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back\r\nunto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king\xe2\x80\x99s son; 22:27\r\nAnd say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed\r\nhim with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I\r\ncome in peace.\r\n\r\n22:28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath\r\nnot spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.\r\n\r\n22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up\r\nto Ramothgilead.\r\n\r\n22:30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise\r\nmyself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the\r\nking of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.\r\n\r\n22:31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that\r\nhad rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor\r\ngreat, save only with the king of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw\r\nJehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they\r\nturned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.\r\n\r\n22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived\r\nthat it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from\r\npursuing him.\r\n\r\n22:34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of\r\nIsrael between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the\r\ndriver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host;\r\nfor I am wounded.\r\n\r\n22:35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in\r\nhis chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran\r\nout of the wound into the midst of the chariot.\r\n\r\n22:36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the\r\ngoing down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to\r\nhis own country.\r\n\r\n22:37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried\r\nthe king in Samaria.\r\n\r\n22:38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs\r\nlicked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the\r\nword of the LORD which he spake.\r\n\r\n22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the\r\nivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they\r\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\r\n22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\n22:41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the\r\nfourth year of Ahab king of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to\r\nreign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\r\n\r\n22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not\r\naside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:\r\nnevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people\r\noffered and burnt incense yet in the high places.\r\n\r\n22:44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he\r\nshewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the\r\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?  22:46 And the remnant of the\r\nsodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\n22:47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.\r\n\r\n22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but\r\nthey went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.\r\n\r\n22:49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my\r\nservants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.\r\n\r\n22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\r\nfathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria\r\nthe seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two\r\nyears over Israel.\r\n\r\n22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way\r\nof his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of\r\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 22:53 For he served\r\nBaal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of\r\nIsrael, according to all that his father had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Book of the Kings\r\n\r\nCommonly Called:\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Book of the Kings\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.\r\n\r\n1:2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that\r\nwas in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto\r\nthem, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall\r\nrecover of this disease.\r\n\r\n1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go\r\nup to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,\r\nIs it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire\r\nof Baalzebub the god of Ekron?  1:4 Now therefore thus saith the LORD,\r\nThou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but\r\nshalt surely die. And Elijah departed.\r\n\r\n1:5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,\r\nWhy are ye now turned back?  1:6 And they said unto him, There came a\r\nman up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that\r\nsent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because\r\nthere is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of\r\nBaalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from\r\nthat bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.\r\n\r\n1:7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to\r\nmeet you, and told you these words?  1:8 And they answered him, He was\r\nan hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And\r\nhe said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.\r\n\r\n1:9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And\r\nhe went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he\r\nspake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.\r\n\r\n1:10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a\r\nman of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and\r\nthy fifty.\r\n\r\nAnd there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\r\n\r\n1:11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nAnd he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king\r\nsaid, Come down quickly.\r\n\r\n1:12 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let\r\nfire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the\r\nfire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.\r\n\r\n1:13 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.\r\nAnd the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees\r\nbefore Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I\r\npray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be\r\nprecious in thy sight.\r\n\r\n1:14 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two\r\ncaptains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my\r\nlife now be precious in thy sight.\r\n\r\n1:15 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be\r\nnot afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.\r\n\r\n1:16 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast\r\nsent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not\r\nbecause there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore\r\nthou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but\r\nshalt surely die.\r\n\r\n1:17 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nAnd Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son\r\nof Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.\r\n\r\n1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not\r\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  2:1 And\r\nit came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a\r\nwhirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.\r\n\r\n2:2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD\r\nhath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth,\r\nand as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to\r\nBethel.\r\n\r\n2:3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to\r\nElisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away\r\nthy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye\r\nyour peace.\r\n\r\n2:4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the\r\nLORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as\r\nthy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.\r\n\r\n2:5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,\r\nand said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy\r\nmaster from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye\r\nyour peace.\r\n\r\n2:6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD\r\nhath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy\r\nsoul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.\r\n\r\n2:7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view\r\nafar off: and they two stood by Jordan.\r\n\r\n2:8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the\r\nwaters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two\r\nwent over on dry ground.\r\n\r\n2:9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said\r\nunto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from\r\nthee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit\r\nbe upon me.\r\n\r\n2:10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou\r\nsee me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if\r\nnot, it shall not be so.\r\n\r\n2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,\r\nbehold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and\r\nparted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n2:12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the\r\nchariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more:\r\nand he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.\r\n\r\n2:13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went\r\nback, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 2:14 And he took the mantle of\r\nElijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is\r\nthe LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they\r\nparted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.\r\n\r\n2:15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho\r\nsaw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they\r\ncame to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.\r\n\r\n2:16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants\r\nfifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest\r\nperadventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him\r\nupon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not\r\nsend.\r\n\r\n2:17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They\r\nsent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n2:18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he\r\nsaid unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?  2:19 And the men of\r\nthe city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this\r\ncity is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the\r\nground barren.\r\n\r\n2:20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they\r\nbrought it to him.\r\n\r\n2:21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the\r\nsalt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these\r\nwaters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.\r\n\r\n2:22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying\r\nof Elisha which he spake.\r\n\r\n2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by\r\nthe way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked\r\nhim, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.\r\n\r\n2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the\r\nname of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood,\r\nand tare forty and two children of them.\r\n\r\n2:25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he\r\nreturned to Samaria.\r\n\r\n3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria\r\nthe eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n3:2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his\r\nfather, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that\r\nhis father had made.\r\n\r\n3:3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of\r\nNebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.\r\n\r\n3:4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the\r\nking of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand\r\nrams, with the wool.\r\n\r\n3:5 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab\r\nrebelled against the king of Israel.\r\n\r\n3:6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered\r\nall Israel.\r\n\r\n3:7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The\r\nking of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against\r\nMoab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people\r\nas thy people, and my horses as thy horses.\r\n\r\n3:8 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way\r\nthrough the wilderness of Edom.\r\n\r\n3:9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of\r\nEdom: and they fetched a compass of seven days\xe2\x80\x99 journey: and there was\r\nno water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.\r\n\r\n3:10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called\r\nthese three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!\r\n3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,\r\nthat we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of\r\nIsrael\xe2\x80\x99s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of\r\nShaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.\r\n\r\n3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the\r\nking of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.\r\n\r\n3:13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with\r\nthee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of\r\nthy mother.\r\n\r\nAnd the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called\r\nthese three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.\r\n\r\n3:14 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I\r\nstand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat\r\nthe king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.\r\n\r\n3:15 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the\r\nminstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.\r\n\r\n3:16 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of\r\nditches.\r\n\r\n3:17 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye\r\nsee rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may\r\ndrink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.\r\n\r\n3:18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will\r\ndeliver the Moabites also into your hand.\r\n\r\n3:19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and\r\nshall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every\r\ngood piece of land with stones.\r\n\r\n3:20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was\r\noffered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the\r\ncountry was filled with water.\r\n\r\n3:21 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to\r\nfight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour,\r\nand upward, and stood in the border.\r\n\r\n3:22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the\r\nwater, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as\r\nblood: 3:23 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain,\r\nand they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.\r\n\r\n3:24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up\r\nand smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went\r\nforward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.\r\n\r\n3:25 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land\r\ncast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the\r\nwells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth\r\nleft they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and\r\nsmote it.\r\n\r\n3:26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for\r\nhim, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break\r\nthrough even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.\r\n\r\n3:27 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his\r\nstead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there\r\nwas great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and\r\nreturned to their own land.\r\n\r\n4:1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the\r\nprophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou\r\nknowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come\r\nto take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.\r\n\r\n4:2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what\r\nhast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any\r\nthing in the house, save a pot of oil.\r\n\r\n4:3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy\r\nneighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.\r\n\r\n4:4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and\r\nupon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou\r\nshalt set aside that which is full.\r\n\r\n4:5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her\r\nsons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.\r\n\r\n4:6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said\r\nunto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is\r\nnot a vessel more. And the oil stayed.\r\n\r\n4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the\r\noil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.\r\n\r\n4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a\r\ngreat woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that\r\nas oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.\r\n\r\n4:9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is\r\nan holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.\r\n\r\n4:10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let\r\nus set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a\r\ncandlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn\r\nin thither.\r\n\r\n4:11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into\r\nthe chamber, and lay there.\r\n\r\n4:12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when\r\nhe had called her, she stood before him.\r\n\r\n4:13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been\r\ncareful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?\r\nwouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the\r\nhost? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.\r\n\r\n4:14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi\r\nanswered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.\r\n\r\n4:15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n4:16 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,\r\nthou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God,\r\ndo not lie unto thine handmaid.\r\n\r\n4:17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that\r\nElisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.\r\n\r\n4:18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out\r\nto his father to the reapers.\r\n\r\n4:19 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a\r\nlad, Carry him to his mother.\r\n\r\n4:20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat\r\non her knees till noon, and then died.\r\n\r\n4:21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and\r\nshut the door upon him, and went out.\r\n\r\n4:22 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,\r\none of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man\r\nof God, and come again.\r\n\r\n4:23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither\r\nnew moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.\r\n\r\n4:24 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go\r\nforward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.\r\n\r\n4:25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it\r\ncame to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to\r\nGehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: 4:26 Run now, I\r\npray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it\r\nwell with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It\r\nis well: 4:27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she\r\ncaught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And\r\nthe man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her:\r\nand the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.\r\n\r\n4:28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do\r\nnot deceive me?  4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and\r\ntake my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man,\r\nsalute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay\r\nmy staff upon the face of the child.\r\n\r\n4:30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy\r\nsoul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.\r\n\r\n4:31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the\r\nface of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore\r\nhe went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not\r\nawaked.\r\n\r\n4:32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was\r\ndead, and laid upon his bed.\r\n\r\n4:33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and\r\nprayed unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon\r\nhis mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands:\r\nand stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\n4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went\r\nup, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times,\r\nand the child opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n4:36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he\r\ncalled her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy\r\nson.\r\n\r\n4:37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the\r\nground, and took up her son, and went out.\r\n\r\n4:38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the\r\nland; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he\r\nsaid unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for\r\nthe sons of the prophets.\r\n\r\n4:39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild\r\nvine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and\r\nshred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.\r\n\r\n4:40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as\r\nthey were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou\r\nman of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.\r\n\r\n4:41 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he\r\nsaid, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no\r\nharm in the pot.\r\n\r\n4:42 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of\r\nGod bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears\r\nof corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that\r\nthey may eat.\r\n\r\n4:43 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred\r\nmen?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus\r\nsaith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.\r\n\r\n4:44 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,\r\naccording to the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great\r\nman with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given\r\ndeliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was\r\na leper.\r\n\r\n5:2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away\r\ncaptive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on\r\nNaaman\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n5:3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the\r\nprophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.\r\n\r\n5:4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the\r\nmaid that is of the land of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter\r\nunto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten\r\ntalents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of\r\nraiment.\r\n\r\n5:6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when\r\nthis letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my\r\nservant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.\r\n\r\n5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,\r\nthat he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make\r\nalive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his\r\nleprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a\r\nquarrel against me.\r\n\r\n5:8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king\r\nof Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,\r\nWherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he\r\nshall know that there is a prophet in Israel.\r\n\r\n5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at\r\nthe door of the house of Elisha.\r\n\r\n5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in\r\nJordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou\r\nshalt be clean.\r\n\r\n5:11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,\r\nHe will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the\r\nLORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the\r\nleper.\r\n\r\n5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all\r\nthe waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he\r\nturned and went away in a rage.\r\n\r\n5:13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My\r\nfather, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou\r\nnot have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash,\r\nand be clean?  5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times\r\nin Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh\r\ncame again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\r\n\r\n5:15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and\r\ncame, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there\r\nis no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee,\r\ntake a blessing of thy servant.\r\n\r\n5:16 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will\r\nreceive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.\r\n\r\n5:17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to\r\nthy servant two mules\xe2\x80\x99 burden of earth? for thy servant will\r\nhenceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods,\r\nbut unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master\r\ngoeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my\r\nhand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself\r\nin the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.\r\n\r\n5:19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a\r\nlittle way.\r\n\r\n5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,\r\nmy master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his\r\nhands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after\r\nhim, and take somewhat of him.\r\n\r\n5:21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running\r\nafter him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is\r\nall well?  5:22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me,\r\nsaying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two\r\nyoung men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a\r\ntalent of silver, and two changes of garments.\r\n\r\n5:23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,\r\nand bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of\r\ngarments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n5:24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and\r\nbestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.\r\n\r\n5:25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto\r\nhim, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no\r\nwhither.\r\n\r\n5:26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man\r\nturned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive\r\nmoney, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and\r\nsheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?  5:27 The leprosy\r\ntherefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for\r\never. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.\r\n\r\n6:1 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the\r\nplace where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.\r\n\r\n6:2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a\r\nbeam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he\r\nanswered, Go ye.\r\n\r\n6:3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.\r\nAnd he answered, I will go.\r\n\r\n6:4 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n6:5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:\r\nand he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.\r\n\r\n6:6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAnd he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did\r\nswim.\r\n\r\n6:7 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,\r\nand took it.\r\n\r\n6:8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel\r\nwith his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.\r\n\r\n6:9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware\r\nthat thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n6:10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God\r\ntold him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\n6:11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for\r\nthis thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye\r\nnot shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?  6:12 And one of\r\nhis servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that\r\nis in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest\r\nin thy bedchamber.\r\n\r\n6:13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.\r\n\r\n6:14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:\r\nand they came by night, and compassed the city about.\r\n\r\n6:15 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone\r\nforth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and\r\nchariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we\r\ndo?  6:16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more\r\nthan they that be with them.\r\n\r\n6:17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,\r\nthat he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he\r\nsaw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire\r\nround about Elisha.\r\n\r\n6:18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and\r\nsaid, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote\r\nthem with blindness according to the word of Elisha.\r\n\r\n6:19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this\r\nthe city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But\r\nhe led them to Samaria.\r\n\r\n6:20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that\r\nElisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And\r\nthe LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in\r\nthe midst of Samaria.\r\n\r\n6:21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My\r\nfather, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?  6:22 And he answered,\r\nThou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast\r\ntaken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water\r\nbefore them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.\r\n\r\n6:23 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten\r\nand drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the\r\nbands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.\r\n\r\n6:24 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria\r\ngathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.\r\n\r\n6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they\r\nbesieged it, until an ass\xe2\x80\x99s head was sold for fourscore pieces of\r\nsilver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove\xe2\x80\x99s dung for five pieces of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n6:26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there\r\ncried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.\r\n\r\n6:27 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help\r\nthee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  6:28 And the\r\nking said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman\r\nsaid unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will\r\neat my son to morrow.\r\n\r\n6:29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the\r\nnext day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.\r\n\r\n6:30 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,\r\nthat he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the\r\npeople looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.\r\n\r\n6:31 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of\r\nElisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.\r\n\r\n6:32 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the\r\nking sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he\r\nsaid to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to\r\ntake away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door,\r\nand hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master\xe2\x80\x99s feet\r\nbehind him?  6:33 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the\r\nmessenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the\r\nLORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?  7:1 Then Elisha\r\nsaid, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow\r\nabout this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel,\r\nand two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.\r\n\r\n7:2 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,\r\nand said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this\r\nthing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but\r\nshalt not eat thereof.\r\n\r\n7:3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:\r\nand they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?  7:4 If we\r\nsay, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and\r\nwe shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now\r\ntherefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they\r\nsave us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.\r\n\r\n7:5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the\r\nSyrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of\r\nSyria, behold, there was no man there.\r\n\r\n7:6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of\r\nchariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and\r\nthey said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us\r\nthe kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\n7:7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their\r\ntents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and\r\nfled for their life.\r\n\r\n7:8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they\r\nwent into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver,\r\nand gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and\r\nentered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid\r\nit.\r\n\r\n7:9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day\r\nof good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning\r\nlight, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we\r\nmay go and tell the king\xe2\x80\x99s household.\r\n\r\n7:10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they\r\ntold them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,\r\nthere was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and\r\nasses tied, and the tents as they were.\r\n\r\n7:11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n7:12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I\r\nwill now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we\r\nbe hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves\r\nin the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch\r\nthem alive, and get into the city.\r\n\r\n7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray\r\nthee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city,\r\n(behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it:\r\nbehold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites\r\nthat are consumed:) and let us send and see.\r\n\r\n7:14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after\r\nthe host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.\r\n\r\n7:15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was\r\nfull of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their\r\nhaste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.\r\n\r\n7:16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So\r\na measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of\r\nbarley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have\r\nthe charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and\r\nhe died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n7:18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,\r\nsaying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine\r\nflour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of\r\nSamaria: 7:19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now,\r\nbehold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing\r\nbe? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt\r\nnot eat thereof.\r\n\r\n7:20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the\r\ngate, and he died.\r\n\r\n8:1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to\r\nlife, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn\r\nwheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine;\r\nand it shall also come upon the land seven years.\r\n\r\n8:2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:\r\nand she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the\r\nPhilistines seven years.\r\n\r\n8:3 And it came to pass at the seven years\xe2\x80\x99 end, that the woman\r\nreturned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry\r\nunto the king for her house and for her land.\r\n\r\n8:4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,\r\nsaying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had\r\nrestored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he\r\nhad restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her\r\nland. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is\r\nher son, whom Elisha restored to life.\r\n\r\n8:6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king\r\nappointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was\r\nhers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the\r\nland, even until now.\r\n\r\n8:7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was\r\nsick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.\r\n\r\n8:8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and\r\ngo, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall\r\nI recover of this disease?  8:9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a\r\npresent with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels\xe2\x80\x99\r\nburden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king\r\nof Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this\r\ndisease?  8:10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest\r\ncertainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall\r\nsurely die.\r\n\r\n8:11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:\r\nand the man of God wept.\r\n\r\n8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I\r\nknow the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their\r\nstrong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay\r\nwith the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women\r\nwith child.\r\n\r\n8:13 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should\r\ndo this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that\r\nthou shalt be king over Syria.\r\n\r\n8:14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to\r\nhim, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou\r\nshouldest surely recover.\r\n\r\n8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,\r\nand dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died:\r\nand Hazael reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n8:16 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,\r\nJehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat\r\nking of Judah began to reign.\r\n\r\n8:17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he\r\nreigned eight years in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house\r\nof Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the\r\nsight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made\r\na king over themselves.\r\n\r\n8:21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he\r\nrose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and\r\nthe captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.\r\n\r\n8:22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.\r\nThen Libnah revolted at the same time.\r\n\r\n8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they\r\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  8:24\r\nAnd Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in\r\nthe city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did\r\nAhaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.\r\n\r\n8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and\r\nhe reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Athaliah,\r\nthe daughter of Omri king of Israel.\r\n\r\n8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in\r\nthe sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in\r\nlaw of the house of Ahab.\r\n\r\n8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael\r\nking of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.\r\n\r\n8:29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds\r\nwhich the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against\r\nHazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah\r\nwent down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n9:1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,\r\nand said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in\r\nthine hand, and go to Ramothgilead: 9:2 And when thou comest thither,\r\nlook out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go\r\nin, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an\r\ninner chamber; 9:3 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head,\r\nand say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.\r\nThen open the door, and flee, and tarry not.\r\n\r\n9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to\r\nRamothgilead.\r\n\r\n9:5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;\r\nand he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto\r\nwhich of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.\r\n\r\n9:6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on\r\nhis head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have\r\nanointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.\r\n\r\n9:7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may\r\navenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the\r\nservants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.\r\n\r\n9:8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from\r\nAhab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and\r\nleft in Israel: 9:9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house\r\nof Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of\r\nAhijah: 9:10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,\r\nand there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.\r\n\r\n9:11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said\r\nunto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he\r\nsaid unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.\r\n\r\n9:12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and\r\nthus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee\r\nking over Israel.\r\n\r\n9:13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it\r\nunder him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying,\r\nJehu is king.\r\n\r\n9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired\r\nagainst Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel,\r\nbecause of Hazael king of Syria.\r\n\r\n9:15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds\r\nwhich the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of\r\nSyria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth\r\nnor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.\r\n\r\n9:16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnd Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.\r\n\r\n9:17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied\r\nthe company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram\r\nsaid, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it\r\npeace?  9:18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said,\r\nThus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do\r\nwith peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The\r\nmessenger came to them, but he cometh not again.\r\n\r\n9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and\r\nsaid, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast\r\nthou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.\r\n\r\n9:20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh\r\nnot again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of\r\nNimshi; for he driveth furiously.\r\n\r\n9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And\r\nJoram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his\r\nchariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of\r\nNaboth the Jezreelite.\r\n\r\n9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it\r\npeace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of\r\nthy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?  9:23 And Joram\r\nturned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O\r\nAhaziah.\r\n\r\n9:24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram\r\nbetween his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk\r\ndown in his chariot.\r\n\r\n9:25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in\r\nthe portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how\r\nthat, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD\r\nlaid this burden upon him; 9:26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood\r\nof Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will\r\nrequite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast\r\nhim into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way\r\nof the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him\r\nalso in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is\r\nby Ibleam.\r\n\r\nAnd he fled to Megiddo, and died there.\r\n\r\n9:28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and\r\nburied him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.\r\n\r\n9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah\r\nto reign over Judah.\r\n\r\n9:30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she\r\npainted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.\r\n\r\n9:31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,\r\nwho slew his master?  9:32 And he lifted up his face to the window,\r\nand said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or\r\nthree eunuchs.\r\n\r\n9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of\r\nher blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode\r\nher under foot.\r\n\r\n9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see\r\nnow this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n9:35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the\r\nskull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.\r\n\r\n9:36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the\r\nword of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,\r\nsaying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:\r\n9:37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the\r\nfield in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is\r\nJezebel.\r\n\r\n10:1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and\r\nsent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to\r\nthem that brought up Ahab\xe2\x80\x99s children, saying, 10:2 Now as soon as this\r\nletter cometh to you, seeing your master\xe2\x80\x99s sons are with you, and\r\nthere are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and\r\narmour; 10:3 Look even out the best and meetest of your master\xe2\x80\x99s sons,\r\nand set him on his father\xe2\x80\x99s throne, and fight for your master\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n10:4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings\r\nstood not before him: how then shall we stand?  10:5 And he that was\r\nover the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and\r\nthe bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy\r\nservants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any\r\nking: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.\r\n\r\n10:6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be\r\nmine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the\r\nmen your master\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this\r\ntime. Now the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great\r\nmen of the city, which brought them up.\r\n\r\n10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in\r\nbaskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.\r\n\r\n10:8 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have\r\nbrought the heads of the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two\r\nheaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.\r\n\r\n10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,\r\nand said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired\r\nagainst my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?  10:10 Know\r\nnow that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the\r\nLORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD\r\nhath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.\r\n\r\n10:11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,\r\nand all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he\r\nleft him none remaining.\r\n\r\n10:12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at\r\nthe shearing house in the way, 10:13 Jehu met with the brethren of\r\nAhaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are\r\nthe brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the\r\nking and the children of the queen.\r\n\r\n10:14 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew\r\nthem at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither\r\nleft he any of them.\r\n\r\n10:15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son\r\nof Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is\r\nthine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab\r\nanswered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his\r\nhand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.\r\n\r\n10:16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they\r\nmade him ride in his chariot.\r\n\r\n10:17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab\r\nin Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the\r\nLORD, which he spake to Elijah.\r\n\r\n10:18 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,\r\nAhab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.\r\n\r\n10:19 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his\r\nservants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great\r\nsacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not\r\nlive. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy\r\nthe worshippers of Baal.\r\n\r\n10:20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they\r\nproclaimed it.\r\n\r\n10:21 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of\r\nBaal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they\r\ncame into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one\r\nend to another.\r\n\r\n10:22 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth\r\nvestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth\r\nvestments.\r\n\r\n10:23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house\r\nof Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that\r\nthere be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the\r\nworshippers of Baal only.\r\n\r\n10:24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,\r\nJehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom\r\nI have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his\r\nlife shall be for the life of him.\r\n\r\n10:25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering\r\nthe burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,\r\nGo in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with\r\nthe edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out,\r\nand went to the city of the house of Baal.\r\n\r\n10:26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and\r\nburned them.\r\n\r\n10:27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house\r\nof Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.\r\n\r\n10:28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\r\n\r\n10:29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\r\nIsrael to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden\r\ncalves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.\r\n\r\n10:30 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in\r\nexecuting that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the\r\nhouse of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of\r\nthe fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.\r\n\r\n10:31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of\r\nIsrael with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of\r\nJeroboam, which made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n10:32 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael\r\nsmote them in all the coasts of Israel; 10:33 From Jordan eastward,\r\nall the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the\r\nManassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and\r\nBashan.\r\n\r\n10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all\r\nhis might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\r\nkings of Israel?  10:35 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they\r\nburied him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n10:36 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty\r\nand eight years.\r\n\r\n11:1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was\r\ndead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.\r\n\r\n11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,\r\ntook Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in\r\nthe bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.\r\n\r\n11:3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And\r\nAthaliah did reign over the land.\r\n\r\n11:4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over\r\nhundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him\r\ninto the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an\r\noath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n11:5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall\r\ndo; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be\r\nkeepers of the watch of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house; 11:6 And a third part shall\r\nbe at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard:\r\nso shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.\r\n\r\n11:7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they\r\nshall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.\r\n\r\n11:8 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his\r\nweapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be\r\nslain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.\r\n\r\n11:9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things\r\nthat Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men\r\nthat were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on\r\nthe sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.\r\n\r\n11:10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,\r\nround about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left\r\ncorner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.\r\n\r\n11:12 And he brought forth the king\xe2\x80\x99s son, and put the crown upon him,\r\nand gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him;\r\nand they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.\r\n\r\n11:13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the\r\npeople, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the\r\nmanner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all\r\nthe people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah\r\nrent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.\r\n\r\n11:15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,\r\nthe officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without\r\nthe ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the\r\npriest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which\r\nthe horses came into the king\xe2\x80\x99s house: and there was she slain.\r\n\r\n11:17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and\r\nthe people, that they should be the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s people; between the king\r\nalso and the people.\r\n\r\n11:18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and\r\nbrake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces\r\nthoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And\r\nthe priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:19 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the\r\nguard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king\r\nfrom the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the\r\nguard to the king\xe2\x80\x99s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.\r\n\r\n11:20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in\r\nquiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n11:21 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.\r\n\r\n12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty\r\nyears reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Zibiah of\r\nBeersheba.\r\n\r\n12:2 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all\r\nhis days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.\r\n\r\n12:3 But the high places were not taken away: the people still\r\nsacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\r\n\r\n12:4 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated\r\nthings that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of\r\nevery one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set\r\nat, and all the money that cometh into any man\xe2\x80\x99s heart to bring into\r\nthe house of the LORD, 12:5 Let the priests take it to them, every man\r\nof his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,\r\nwheresoever any breach shall be found.\r\n\r\n12:6 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king\r\nJehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.\r\n\r\n12:7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other\r\npriests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the\r\nhouse? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but\r\ndeliver it for the breaches of the house.\r\n\r\n12:8 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,\r\nneither to repair the breaches of the house.\r\n\r\n12:9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid\r\nof it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh\r\ninto the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put\r\ntherein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:10 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the\r\nchest, that the king\xe2\x80\x99s scribe and the high priest came up, and they\r\nput up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n12:11 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that\r\ndid the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and\r\nthey laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the\r\nhouse of the LORD, 12:12 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to\r\nbuy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the\r\nLORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.\r\n\r\n12:13 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of\r\nsilver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of\r\nsilver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:\r\n12:14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the\r\nhouse of the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they\r\ndelivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt\r\nfaithfully.\r\n\r\n12:16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house\r\nof the LORD: it was the priests\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n12:17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and\r\ntook it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that\r\nJehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah,\r\nhad dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was\r\nfound in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:19 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they\r\nnot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\r\n12:20 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in\r\nthe house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.\r\n\r\n12:21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of\r\nShomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with\r\nhis fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n13:1 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king\r\nof Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in\r\nSamaria, and reigned seventeen years.\r\n\r\n13:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and\r\nfollowed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to\r\nsin; he departed not therefrom.\r\n\r\n13:3 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he\r\ndelivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the\r\nhand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.\r\n\r\n13:4 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:\r\nfor he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria\r\noppressed them.\r\n\r\n13:5 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from\r\nunder the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in\r\ntheir tents, as beforetime.\r\n\r\n13:6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of\r\nJeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained\r\nthe grove also in Samaria.)  13:7 Neither did he leave of the people\r\nto Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand\r\nfootmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them\r\nlike the dust by threshing.\r\n\r\n13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and\r\nhis might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\r\nkings of Israel?  13:9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they\r\nburied him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n13:10 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began\r\nJehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and\r\nreigned sixteen years.\r\n\r\n13:11 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he\r\ndeparted not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\r\nIsrael sin: but he walked therein.\r\n\r\n13:12 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his\r\nmight wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not\r\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  13:13\r\nAnd Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:\r\nand Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.\r\n\r\n13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And\r\nJoash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face,\r\nand said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the\r\nhorsemen thereof.\r\n\r\n13:15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto\r\nhim bow and arrows.\r\n\r\n13:16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.\r\nAnd he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n13:17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then\r\nElisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt\r\nsmite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.\r\n\r\n13:18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto\r\nthe king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and\r\nstayed.\r\n\r\n13:19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest\r\nhave smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till\r\nthou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.\r\n\r\n13:20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the\r\nMoabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.\r\n\r\n13:21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,\r\nthey spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of\r\nElisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of\r\nElisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.\r\n\r\n13:22 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of\r\nJehoahaz.\r\n\r\n13:23 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,\r\nand had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham,\r\nIsaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them\r\nfrom his presence as yet.\r\n\r\n13:24 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\n13:25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of\r\nBenhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the\r\nhand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him,\r\nand recovered the cities of Israel.\r\n\r\n14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel\r\nreigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.\r\n\r\n14:2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and\r\nreigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nJehoaddan of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n14:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not\r\nlike David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his\r\nfather did.\r\n\r\n14:4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people\r\ndid sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.\r\n\r\n14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his\r\nhand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.\r\n\r\n14:6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto\r\nthat which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the\r\nLORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the\r\nchildren, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every\r\nman shall be put to death for his own sin.\r\n\r\n14:7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took\r\nSelah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.\r\n\r\n14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son\r\nof Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n14:9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,\r\nsaying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in\r\nLebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed\r\nby a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.\r\n\r\n14:10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee\r\nup: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to\r\nthy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?\r\n14:11 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel\r\nwent up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the\r\nface at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.\r\n\r\n14:12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled\r\nevery man to their tents.\r\n\r\n14:13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son\r\nof Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem,\r\nand brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the\r\ncorner gate, four hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n14:14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that\r\nwere found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.\r\n\r\n14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,\r\nand how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in\r\nthe book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  14:16 And Jehoash\r\nslept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of\r\nIsrael; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death\r\nof Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.\r\n\r\n14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the\r\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  14:19 Now they made a\r\nconspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they\r\nsent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.\r\n\r\n14:20 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem\r\nwith his fathers in the city of David.\r\n\r\n14:21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen\r\nyears old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.\r\n\r\n14:22 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king\r\nslept with his fathers.\r\n\r\n14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah\r\nJeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria,\r\nand reigned forty and one years.\r\n\r\n14:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\r\ndeparted not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\r\nIsrael to sin.\r\n\r\n14:25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto\r\nthe sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel,\r\nwhich he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai,\r\nthe prophet, which was of Gathhepher.\r\n\r\n14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very\r\nbitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper\r\nfor Israel.\r\n\r\n14:27 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel\r\nfrom under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son\r\nof Joash.\r\n\r\n14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and\r\nhis might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath,\r\nwhich belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book\r\nof the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  14:29 And Jeroboam slept\r\nwith his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:1 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began\r\nAzariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.\r\n\r\n15:2 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\ntwo and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Jecholiah\r\nof Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n15:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that his father Amaziah had done; 15:4 Save that the\r\nhigh places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense\r\nstill on the high places.\r\n\r\n15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day\r\nof his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nwas over the house, judging the people of the land.\r\n\r\n15:6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\r\n15:7 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his\r\nfathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did\r\nZachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.\r\n\r\n15:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his\r\nfathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of\r\nNebat, who made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n15:10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote\r\nhim before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written\r\nin the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\r\n\r\n15:12 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying,\r\nThy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation.\r\nAnd so it came to pass.\r\n\r\n15:13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and\r\nthirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in\r\nSamaria.\r\n\r\n15:14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to\r\nSamaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him,\r\nand reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n15:15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he\r\nmade, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the\r\nkings of Israel.\r\n\r\n15:16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the\r\ncoasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore\r\nhe smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped\r\nup.\r\n\r\n15:17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began\r\nMenahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in\r\nSamaria.\r\n\r\n15:18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\r\ndeparted not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,\r\nwho made Israel to sin.\r\n\r\n15:19 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem\r\ngave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him\r\nto confirm the kingdom in his hand.\r\n\r\n15:20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty\r\nmen of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the\r\nking of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not\r\nthere in the land.\r\n\r\n15:21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\r\n15:22 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son\r\nof Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n15:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\r\ndeparted not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\r\nIsrael to sin.\r\n\r\n15:25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired\r\nagainst him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites:\r\nand he killed him, and reigned in his room.\r\n\r\n15:26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,\r\nbehold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n15:27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the\r\nson of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n15:28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he\r\ndeparted not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made\r\nIsrael to sin.\r\n\r\n15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of\r\nAssyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh,\r\nand Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and\r\ncarried them captive to Assyria.\r\n\r\n15:30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the\r\nson of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his\r\nstead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.\r\n\r\n15:31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,\r\nthey are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.\r\n\r\n15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel\r\nbegan Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.\r\n\r\n15:33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Jerusha,\r\nthe daughter of Zadok.\r\n\r\n15:34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did\r\naccording to all that his father Uzziah had done.\r\n\r\n15:35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed\r\nand burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate\r\nof the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\r\n15:37 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the\r\nking of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.\r\n\r\n15:38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\r\nfathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\n16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son\r\nof Jotham king of Judah began to reign.\r\n\r\n16:2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned\r\nsixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the\r\nsight of the LORD his God, like David his father.\r\n\r\n16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made\r\nhis son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the\r\nheathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n16:4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on\r\nthe hills, and under every green tree.\r\n\r\n16:5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel\r\ncame up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not\r\novercome him.\r\n\r\n16:6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and\r\ndrave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt\r\nthere unto this day.\r\n\r\n16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,\r\nsaying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the\r\nhand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel,\r\nwhich rise up against me.\r\n\r\n16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of\r\nthe LORD, and in the treasures of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and sent it for a\r\npresent to the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n16:9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of\r\nAssyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people\r\nof it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.\r\n\r\n16:10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of\r\nAssyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to\r\nUrijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it,\r\naccording to all the workmanship thereof.\r\n\r\n16:11 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king\r\nAhaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king\r\nAhaz came from Damascus.\r\n\r\n16:12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the\r\naltar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.\r\n\r\n16:13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and\r\npoured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace\r\nofferings, upon the altar.\r\n\r\n16:14 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD,\r\nfrom the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house\r\nof the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.\r\n\r\n16:15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the\r\ngreat altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat\r\noffering, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with\r\nthe burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat\r\noffering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the\r\nblood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and\r\nthe brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.\r\n\r\n16:16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the\r\nlaver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen\r\nthat were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.\r\n\r\n16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house,\r\nand the king\xe2\x80\x99s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for\r\nthe king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not\r\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  16:20\r\nAnd Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in\r\nthe city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of\r\nElah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.\r\n\r\n17:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not\r\nas the kings of Israel that were before him.\r\n\r\n17:3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea\r\nbecame his servant, and gave him presents.\r\n\r\n17:4 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had\r\nsent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the\r\nking of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of\r\nAssyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.\r\n\r\n17:5 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and\r\nwent up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.\r\n\r\n17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and\r\ncarried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in\r\nHabor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\r\n\r\n17:7 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the\r\nLORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt,\r\nfrom under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other\r\ngods, 17:8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD\r\ncast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of\r\nIsrael, which they had made.\r\n\r\n17:9 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were\r\nnot right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places\r\nin all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n17:10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and\r\nunder every green tree: 17:11 And there they burnt incense in all the\r\nhigh places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before\r\nthem; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger: 17:12\r\nFor they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall\r\nnot do this thing.\r\n\r\n17:13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all\r\nthe prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil\r\nways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the\r\nlaw which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my\r\nservants the prophets.\r\n\r\n17:14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,\r\nlike to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD\r\ntheir God.\r\n\r\n17:15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made\r\nwith their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against\r\nthem; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the\r\nheathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had\r\ncharged them, that they should not do like them.\r\n\r\n17:16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and\r\nmade them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and\r\nworshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.\r\n\r\n17:17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through\r\nthe fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to\r\ndo evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.\r\n\r\n17:18 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them\r\nout of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.\r\n\r\n17:19 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but\r\nwalked in the statutes of Israel which they made.\r\n\r\n17:20 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted\r\nthem, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast\r\nthem out of his sight.\r\n\r\n17:21 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made\r\nJeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from\r\nfollowing the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.\r\n\r\n17:22 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam\r\nwhich he did; they departed not from them; 17:23 Until the LORD\r\nremoved Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants\r\nthe prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to\r\nAssyria unto this day.\r\n\r\n17:24 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from\r\nCuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed\r\nthem in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and\r\nthey possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.\r\n\r\n17:25 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that\r\nthey feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them,\r\nwhich slew some of them.\r\n\r\n17:26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations\r\nwhich thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not\r\nthe manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among\r\nthem, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of\r\nthe God of the land.\r\n\r\n17:27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of\r\nthe priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell\r\nthere, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.\r\n\r\n17:28 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria\r\ncame and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n17:29 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the\r\nhouses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation\r\nin their cities wherein they dwelt.\r\n\r\n17:30 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth\r\nmade Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 17:31 And the Avites\r\nmade Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in\r\nfire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\r\n\r\n17:32 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest\r\nof them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the\r\nhouses of the high places.\r\n\r\n17:33 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the\r\nmanner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.\r\n\r\n17:34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not\r\nthe LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their\r\nordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded\r\nthe children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 17:35 With whom the LORD\r\nhad made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other\r\ngods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to\r\nthem: 17:36 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt\r\nwith great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him\r\nshall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.\r\n\r\n17:37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the\r\ncommandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for\r\nevermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.\r\n\r\n17:38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;\r\nneither shall ye fear other gods.\r\n\r\n17:39 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you\r\nout of the hand of all your enemies.\r\n\r\n17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n17:41 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven\r\nimages, both their children, and their children\xe2\x80\x99s children: as did\r\ntheir fathers, so do they unto this day.\r\n\r\n18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king\r\nof Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.\r\n\r\n18:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he\r\nreigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s name also was\r\nAbi, the daughter of Zachariah.\r\n\r\n18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that David his father did.\r\n\r\n18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down\r\nthe groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had\r\nmade: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to\r\nit: and he called it Nehushtan.\r\n\r\n18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none\r\nlike him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.\r\n\r\n18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,\r\nbut kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.\r\n\r\n18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went\r\nforth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders\r\nthereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.\r\n\r\n18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which\r\nwas the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that\r\nShalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.\r\n\r\n18:10 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth\r\nyear of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,\r\nSamaria was taken.\r\n\r\n18:11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and\r\nput them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the\r\ncities of the Medes: 18:12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the\r\nLORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the\r\nservant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.\r\n\r\n18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king\r\nof Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n18:14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to\r\nLachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou\r\nputtest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto\r\nHezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty\r\ntalents of gold.\r\n\r\n18:15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house\r\nof the LORD, and in the treasures of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n18:16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the\r\ntemple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah\r\nhad overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh\r\nfrom Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And\r\nthey went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they\r\ncame and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the\r\nhighway of the fuller\xe2\x80\x99s field.\r\n\r\n18:18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them\r\nEliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna\r\nthe scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.\r\n\r\n18:19 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus\r\nsaith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this\r\nwherein thou trustest?  18:20 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain\r\nwords,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou\r\ntrust, that thou rebellest against me?  18:21 Now, behold, thou\r\ntrustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on\r\nwhich if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is\r\nPharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.\r\n\r\n18:22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that\r\nhe, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and\r\nhath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar\r\nin Jerusalem?  18:23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my\r\nlord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses,\r\nif thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.\r\n\r\n18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the\r\nleast of my master\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots\r\nand for horsemen?  18:25 Am I now come up without the LORD against\r\nthis place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this\r\nland, and destroy it.\r\n\r\n18:26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto\r\nRabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language;\r\nfor we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 language in\r\nthe ears of the people that are on the wall.\r\n\r\n18:27 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy\r\nmaster, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the\r\nmen which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink\r\ntheir own piss with you?  18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a\r\nloud voice in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of\r\nthe great king, the king of Assyria: 18:29 Thus saith the king, Let\r\nnot Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out\r\nof his hand: 18:30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD,\r\nsaying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be\r\ndelivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n18:31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,\r\nMake an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then\r\neat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and\r\ndrink ye every one the waters of his cistern: 18:32 Until I come and\r\ntake you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a\r\nland of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye\r\nmay live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he\r\npersuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.\r\n\r\n18:33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land\r\nout of the hand of the king of Assyria?  18:34 Where are the gods of\r\nHamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and\r\nIvah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?  18:35 Who are\r\nthey among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their\r\ncountry out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out\r\nof mine hand?  18:36 But the people held their peace, and answered him\r\nnot a word: for the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.\r\n\r\n18:37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the\r\nhousehold, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the\r\nrecorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words\r\nof Rabshakeh.\r\n\r\n19:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent\r\nhis clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the\r\nhouse of the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:2 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the\r\nscribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to\r\nIsaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.\r\n\r\n19:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of\r\ntrouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to\r\nthe birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.\r\n\r\n19:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,\r\nwhom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living\r\nGod; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard:\r\nwherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.\r\n\r\n19:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.\r\n\r\n19:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with\r\nwhich the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.\r\n\r\n19:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,\r\nand shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the\r\nsword in his own land.\r\n\r\n19:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring\r\nagainst Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.\r\n\r\n19:9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is\r\ncome out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto\r\nHezekiah, saying, 19:10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah,\r\nsaying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying,\r\nJerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n19:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to\r\nall lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?\r\n19:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers\r\nhave destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of\r\nEden which were in Thelasar?  19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and\r\nthe king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena,\r\nand Ivah?  19:14 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the\r\nmessengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the\r\nLORD, and spread it before the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of\r\nIsrael, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even\r\nthou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven\r\nand earth.\r\n\r\n19:16 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and\r\nsee: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to\r\nreproach the living God.\r\n\r\n19:17 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the\r\nnations and their lands, 19:18 And have cast their gods into the fire:\r\nfor they were no gods, but the work of men\xe2\x80\x99s hands, wood and stone:\r\ntherefore they have destroyed them.\r\n\r\n19:19 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out\r\nof his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art\r\nthe LORD God, even thou only.\r\n\r\n19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith\r\nthe LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against\r\nSennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.\r\n\r\n19:21 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The\r\nvirgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to\r\nscorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.\r\n\r\n19:22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast\r\nthou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against\r\nthe Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n19:23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,\r\nWith the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the\r\nmountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar\r\ntrees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into\r\nthe lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.\r\n\r\n19:24 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my\r\nfeet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.\r\n\r\n19:25 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient\r\ntimes that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou\r\nshouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.\r\n\r\n19:26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were\r\ndismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as\r\nthe green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted\r\nbefore it be grown up.\r\n\r\n19:27 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and\r\nthy rage against me.\r\n\r\n19:28 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine\r\nears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy\r\nlips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.\r\n\r\n19:29 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such\r\nthings as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which\r\nspringeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and\r\nplant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.\r\n\r\n19:30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet\r\nagain take root downward, and bear fruit upward.\r\n\r\n19:31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that\r\nescape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.\r\n\r\n19:32 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He\r\nshall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come\r\nbefore it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.\r\n\r\n19:33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall\r\nnot come into this city, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and\r\nfor my servant David\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n19:35 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went\r\nout, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and\r\nfive thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they\r\nwere all dead corpses.\r\n\r\n19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,\r\nand dwelt at Nineveh.\r\n\r\n19:37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of\r\nNisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with\r\nthe sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon\r\nhis son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n20:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet\r\nIsaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the\r\nLORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.\r\n\r\n20:2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,\r\nsaying, 20:3 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked\r\nbefore thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that\r\nwhich is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.\r\n\r\n20:4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle\r\ncourt, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 20:5 Turn again,\r\nand tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the\r\nGod of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\r\ntears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up\r\nunto the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver\r\nthee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will\r\ndefend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n20:7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it\r\non the boil, and he recovered.\r\n\r\n20:8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the\r\nLORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD\r\nthe third day?  20:9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the\r\nLORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the\r\nshadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?  20:10 And\r\nHezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten\r\ndegrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.\r\n\r\n20:11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the\r\nshadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of\r\nAhaz.\r\n\r\n20:12 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of\r\nBabylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard\r\nthat Hezekiah had been sick.\r\n\r\n20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house\r\nof his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and\r\nthe precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that\r\nwas found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all\r\nhis dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.\r\n\r\n20:14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto\r\nhim, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And\r\nHezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.\r\n\r\n20:15 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah\r\nanswered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there\r\nis nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.\r\n\r\n20:16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:17 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that\r\nwhich thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be\r\ncarried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:18 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt\r\nbeget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace\r\nof the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n20:19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD\r\nwhich thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and\r\ntruth be in my days?  20:20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and\r\nall his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought\r\nwater into the city, are they not written in the book of the\r\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?  20:21 And Hezekiah slept with his\r\nfathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned\r\nfifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nHephzibah.\r\n\r\n21:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after\r\nthe abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the\r\nchildren of Israel.\r\n\r\n21:3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father\r\nhad destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as\r\ndid Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and\r\nserved them.\r\n\r\n21:4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD\r\nsaid, In Jerusalem will I put my name.\r\n\r\n21:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts\r\nof the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,\r\nand used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he\r\nwrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n21:7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the\r\nhouse, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In\r\nthis house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of\r\nIsrael, will I put my name for ever: 21:8 Neither will I make the feet\r\nof Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers;\r\nonly if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded\r\nthem, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n21:9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil\r\nthan did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n21:10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 21:11\r\nBecause Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath\r\ndone wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him,\r\nand hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 21:12 Therefore thus\r\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon\r\nJerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall\r\ntingle.\r\n\r\n21:13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the\r\nplummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man\r\nwipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.\r\n\r\n21:14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver\r\nthem into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and\r\na spoil to all their enemies; 21:15 Because they have done that which\r\nwas evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day\r\ntheir fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.\r\n\r\n21:16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had\r\nfilled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he\r\nmade Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and\r\nhis sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the\r\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?  21:18 And Manasseh slept with his\r\nfathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden\r\nof Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n21:19 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nMeshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.\r\n\r\n21:20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his\r\nfather Manasseh did.\r\n\r\n21:21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and\r\nserved the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 21:22\r\nAnd he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the\r\nking in his own house.\r\n\r\n21:24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired\r\nagainst king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not\r\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  21:26\r\nAnd he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah\r\nhis son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\nthirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Jedidah,\r\nthe daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.\r\n\r\n22:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and\r\nwalked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the\r\nright hand or to the left.\r\n\r\n22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that\r\nthe king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the\r\nscribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 22:4 Go up to Hilkiah the\r\nhigh priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the\r\nhouse of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the\r\npeople: 22:5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the\r\nwork, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them\r\ngive it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to\r\nrepair the breaches of the house, 22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders,\r\nand masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.\r\n\r\n22:7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that\r\nwas delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.\r\n\r\n22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have\r\nfound the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave\r\nthe book to Shaphan, and he read it.\r\n\r\n22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king\r\nword again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was\r\nfound in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that\r\ndo the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the\r\npriest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.\r\n\r\n22:11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the\r\nbook of the law, that he rent his clothes.\r\n\r\n22:12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of\r\nShaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and\r\nAsahiah a servant of the king\xe2\x80\x99s, saying, 22:13 Go ye, enquire of the\r\nLORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the\r\nwords of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD\r\nthat is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened\r\nunto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is\r\nwritten concerning us.\r\n\r\n22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and\r\nAsahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son\r\nof Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt\r\nin Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.\r\n\r\n22:15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell\r\nthe man that sent you to me, 22:16 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will\r\nbring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all\r\nthe words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: 22:17 Because\r\nthey have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that\r\nthey might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;\r\ntherefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not\r\nbe quenched.\r\n\r\n22:18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,\r\nthus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As\r\ntouching the words which thou hast heard; 22:19 Because thine heart\r\nwas tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou\r\nheardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants\r\nthereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast\r\nrent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n22:20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou\r\nshalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not\r\nsee all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought\r\nthe king word again.\r\n\r\n23:1 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of\r\nJudah and of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n23:2 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men\r\nof Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the\r\npriests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great:\r\nand he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant\r\nwhich was found in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the\r\nLORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his\r\ntestimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul,\r\nto perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.\r\nAnd all the people stood to the covenant.\r\n\r\n23:4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests\r\nof the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out\r\nof the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and\r\nfor the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them\r\nwithout Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of\r\nthem unto Bethel.\r\n\r\n23:5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah\r\nhad ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of\r\nJudah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned\r\nincense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets,\r\nand to all the host of heaven.\r\n\r\n23:6 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without\r\nJerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron,\r\nand stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the\r\ngraves of the children of the people.\r\n\r\n23:7 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the\r\nhouse of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.\r\n\r\n23:8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and\r\ndefiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from\r\nGeba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that\r\nwere in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the\r\ncity, which were on a man\xe2\x80\x99s left hand at the gate of the city.\r\n\r\n23:9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the\r\naltar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened\r\nbread among their brethren.\r\n\r\n23:10 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children\r\nof Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass\r\nthrough the fire to Molech.\r\n\r\n23:11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to\r\nthe sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber\r\nof Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned\r\nthe chariots of the sun with fire.\r\n\r\n23:12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of\r\nAhaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh\r\nhad made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat\r\ndown, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into\r\nthe brook Kidron.\r\n\r\n23:13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on\r\nthe right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of\r\nIsrael had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and\r\nfor Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the\r\nabomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.\r\n\r\n23:14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and\r\nfilled their places with the bones of men.\r\n\r\n23:15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which\r\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that\r\naltar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and\r\nstamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.\r\n\r\n23:16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were\r\nthere in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the\r\nsepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according\r\nto the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who\r\nproclaimed these words.\r\n\r\n23:17 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the\r\ncity told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from\r\nJudah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the\r\naltar of Bethel.\r\n\r\n23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they\r\nlet his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of\r\nSamaria.\r\n\r\n23:19 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the\r\ncities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the\r\nLord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the\r\nacts that he had done in Bethel.\r\n\r\n23:20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there\r\nupon the altars, and burned men\xe2\x80\x99s bones upon them, and returned to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n23:21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover\r\nunto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.\r\n\r\n23:22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the\r\njudges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel,\r\nnor of the kings of Judah; 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of king\r\nJosiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n23:24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and\r\nthe images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in\r\nthe land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might\r\nperform the words of the law which were written in the book that\r\nHilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to\r\nthe LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his\r\nmight, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose\r\nthere any like him.\r\n\r\n23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his\r\ngreat wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of\r\nall the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.\r\n\r\n23:27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as\r\nI have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I\r\nhave chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.\r\n\r\n23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\r\n23:29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king\r\nof Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him;\r\nand he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.\r\n\r\n23:30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and\r\nbrought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the\r\npeople of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him,\r\nand made him king in his father\xe2\x80\x99s stead.\r\n\r\n23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign;\r\nand he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nHamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\r\n\r\n23:32 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that his fathers had done.\r\n\r\n23:33 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of\r\nHamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a\r\ntribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.\r\n\r\n23:34 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the\r\nroom of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took\r\nJehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.\r\n\r\n23:35 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he\r\ntaxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of\r\nPharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land,\r\nof every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.\r\n\r\n23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign;\r\nand he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nZebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.\r\n\r\n23:37 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that his fathers had done.\r\n\r\n24:1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim\r\nbecame his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n24:2 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of\r\nthe Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of\r\nAmmon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the\r\nword of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.\r\n\r\n24:3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to\r\nremove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to\r\nall that he did; 24:4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed:\r\nfor he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not\r\npardon.\r\n\r\n24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\r\n24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n24:7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:\r\nfor the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the\r\nriver Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.\r\n\r\n24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Nehushta,\r\nthe daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n24:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that his father had done.\r\n\r\n24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came\r\nup against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.\r\n\r\n24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and\r\nhis servants did besiege it.\r\n\r\n24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of\r\nBabylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and\r\nhis officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of\r\nhis reign.\r\n\r\n24:13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the\r\nLORD, and the treasures of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and cut in pieces all the\r\nvessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of\r\nthe LORD, as the LORD had said.\r\n\r\n24:14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all\r\nthe mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the\r\ncraftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the\r\npeople of the land.\r\n\r\n24:15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the\r\nland, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.\r\n\r\n24:16 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and\r\nsmiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the\r\nking of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.\r\n\r\n24:17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father\xe2\x80\x99s brother king\r\nin his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.\r\n\r\n24:18 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,\r\nand he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nHamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\r\n\r\n24:19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that Jehoiakim had done.\r\n\r\n24:20 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem\r\nand Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah\r\nrebelled against the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n25:1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth\r\nmonth, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of\r\nBabylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched\r\nagainst it; and they built forts against it round about.\r\n\r\n25:2 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king\r\nZedekiah.\r\n\r\n25:3 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in\r\nthe city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.\r\n\r\n25:4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night\r\nby the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the\r\nking went the way toward the plain.\r\n\r\n25:5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook\r\nhim in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n25:6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon\r\nto Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.\r\n\r\n25:7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out\r\nthe eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried\r\nhim to Babylon.\r\n\r\n25:8 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is\r\nthe nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came\r\nNebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,\r\nunto Jerusalem: 25:9 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse burnt he with fire.\r\n\r\n25:10 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of\r\nthe guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.\r\n\r\n25:11 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the\r\nfugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of\r\nthe multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.\r\n\r\n25:12 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the\r\nland to be vinedressers and husbandmen.\r\n\r\n25:13 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and\r\nthe bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did\r\nthe Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\n25:14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,\r\nand all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they\r\naway.\r\n\r\n25:15 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of\r\ngold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took\r\naway.\r\n\r\n25:16 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made\r\nfor the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n25:17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the\r\nchapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three\r\ncubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter\r\nround about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar\r\nwith wreathen work.\r\n\r\n25:18 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and\r\nZephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 25:19\r\nAnd out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of\r\nwar, and five men of them that were in the king\xe2\x80\x99s presence, which were\r\nfound in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which\r\nmustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of\r\nthe land that were found in the city: 25:20 And Nebuzaradan captain of\r\nthe guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to\r\nRiblah: 25:21 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at\r\nRiblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their\r\nland.\r\n\r\n25:22 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom\r\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made\r\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.\r\n\r\n25:23 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,\r\nheard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came\r\nto Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan\r\nthe son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite,\r\nand Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.\r\n\r\n25:24 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto\r\nthem, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land,\r\nand serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.\r\n\r\n25:25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son\r\nof Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten\r\nmen with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the\r\nChaldees that were with him at Mizpah.\r\n\r\n25:26 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of\r\nthe armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the\r\nChaldees.\r\n\r\n25:27 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the\r\ncaptivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the\r\nseven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of\r\nBabylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of\r\nJehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 25:28 And he spake kindly to\r\nhim, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with\r\nhim in Babylon; 25:29 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat\r\nbread continually before him all the days of his life.\r\n\r\n25:30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the\r\nking, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Book of the Chronicles\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Adam, Sheth, Enosh, 1:2 Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered, 1:3 Henoch,\r\nMethuselah, Lamech, 1:4 Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\r\n\r\n1:5 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and\r\nTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.\r\n\r\n1:6 And the sons of Gomer; Ashchenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.\r\n\r\n1:7 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\r\n\r\n1:8 The sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.\r\n\r\n1:9 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabta, and Raamah,\r\nand Sabtecha.

And they also dwelt with their\r\nbrethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.\r\n\r\n9:39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan,\r\nand Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.\r\n\r\n9:40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah.\r\n\r\n9:41 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and\r\nAhaz.\r\n\r\n9:42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and\r\nZimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 9:43 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah\r\nhis son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.\r\n\r\n9:44 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru,\r\nand Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons\r\nof Azel.\r\n\r\n10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel\r\nfled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.\r\n\r\n10:2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons;\r\nand the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the\r\nsons of Saul.\r\n\r\n10:3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him,\r\nand he was wounded of the archers.\r\n\r\n10:4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me\r\nthrough therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his\r\narmourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword,\r\nand fell upon it.\r\n\r\n10:5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell\r\nlikewise on the sword, and died.\r\n\r\n10:6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n10:7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that\r\nthey fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook\r\ntheir cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.\r\n\r\n10:8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to\r\nstrip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount\r\nGilboa.\r\n\r\n10:9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his\r\narmour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to\r\ncarry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.\r\n\r\n10:10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened\r\nhis head in the temple of Dagon.\r\n\r\n10:11 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had\r\ndone to Saul, 10:12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the\r\nbody of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,\r\nand buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.\r\n\r\n10:13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against\r\nthe LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and\r\nalso for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire\r\nof it; 10:14 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and\r\nturned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.\r\n\r\n11:1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying,\r\nBehold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.\r\n\r\n11:2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he\r\nthat leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said\r\nunto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler\r\nover my people Israel.\r\n\r\n11:3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;\r\nand David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and\r\nthey anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the\r\nLORD by Samuel.\r\n\r\n11:4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where\r\nthe Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\n11:5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come\r\nhither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city\r\nof David.\r\n\r\n11:6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be\r\nchief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n11:7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city\r\nof David.\r\n\r\n11:8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about:\r\nand Joab repaired the rest of the city.\r\n\r\n11:9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n11:10 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who\r\nstrengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel,\r\nto make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.\r\n\r\n11:11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;\r\nJashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his\r\nspear against three hundred slain by him at one time.\r\n\r\n11:12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was\r\none of the three mighties.\r\n\r\n11:13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were\r\ngathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of\r\nbarley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.\r\n\r\n11:14 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and\r\ndelivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a\r\ngreat deliverance.\r\n\r\n11:15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David,\r\ninto the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in\r\nthe valley of Rephaim.\r\n\r\n11:16 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines\xe2\x80\x99 garrison\r\nwas then at Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n11:17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of\r\nthe water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!  11:18 And\r\nthe three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water\r\nout of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and\r\nbrought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it\r\nout to the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:\r\nshall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in\r\njeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.\r\nTherefore he would not drink it.\r\n\r\nThese things did these three mightiest.\r\n\r\n11:20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for\r\nlifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a\r\nname among the three.\r\n\r\n11:21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was\r\ntheir captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.\r\n\r\n11:22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of\r\nKabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab:\r\nalso he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.\r\n\r\n11:23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits\r\nhigh; and in the Egyptian\xe2\x80\x99s hand was a spear like a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s beam; and\r\nhe went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the\r\nEgyptian\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and slew him with his own spear.\r\n\r\n11:24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name\r\namong the three mighties.\r\n\r\n11:25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to\r\nthe first three: and David set him over his guard.\r\n\r\n11:26 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of\r\nJoab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 11:27 Shammoth the\r\nHarorite, Helez the Pelonite, 11:28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\r\nAbiezer the Antothite, 11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the\r\nAhohite, 11:30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the\r\nNetophathite, 11:31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained\r\nto the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 11:32 Hurai of\r\nthe brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 11:33 Azmaveth the\r\nBaharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 11:34 The sons of Hashem the\r\nGizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, 11:35 Ahiam the son\r\nof Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 11:36 Hepher the\r\nMecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 11:37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai\r\nthe son of Ezbai, 11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of\r\nHaggeri, 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the\r\narmourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb\r\nthe Ithrite, 11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 11:42\r\nAdina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and\r\nthirty with him, 11:43 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the\r\nMithnite, 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of\r\nHothan the Aroerite, 11:45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his\r\nbrother, the Tizite, 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and\r\nJoshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 11:47 Eliel,\r\nand Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.\r\n\r\n12:1 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet\r\nkept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were\r\namong the mighty men, helpers of the war.\r\n\r\n12:2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and\r\nthe left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of\r\nSaul\xe2\x80\x99s brethren of Benjamin.\r\n\r\n12:3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the\r\nGibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah,\r\nand Jehu the Antothite.\r\n\r\n12:4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and\r\nover the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad\r\nthe Gederathite, 12:5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and\r\nShemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 12:6 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and\r\nAzareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, 12:7 And Joelah, and\r\nZebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.\r\n\r\n12:8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the\r\nhold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the\r\nbattle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like\r\nthe faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;\r\n12:9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 12:10\r\nMishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 12:11 Attai the sixth,\r\nEliel the seventh, 12:12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 12:13\r\nJeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.\r\n\r\n12:14 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the\r\nleast was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.\r\n\r\n12:15 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it\r\nhad overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the\r\nvalleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.\r\n\r\n12:16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold\r\nunto David.\r\n\r\n12:17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto\r\nthem, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be\r\nknit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing\r\nthere is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon,\r\nand rebuke it.\r\n\r\n12:18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains,\r\nand he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse:\r\npeace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God\r\nhelpeth thee.\r\n\r\nThen David received them, and made them captains of the band.\r\n\r\n12:19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the\r\nPhilistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the\r\nlords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He\r\nwill fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.\r\n\r\n12:20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and\r\nJozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and\r\nZilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.\r\n\r\n12:21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they\r\nwere all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.\r\n\r\n12:22 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,\r\nuntil it was a great host, like the host of God.\r\n\r\n12:23 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to\r\nthe war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to\r\nhim, according to the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six\r\nthousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.\r\n\r\n12:25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,\r\nseven thousand and one hundred.\r\n\r\n12:26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.\r\n\r\n12:27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were\r\nthree thousand and seven hundred; 12:28 And Zadok, a young man mighty\r\nof valour, and of his father\xe2\x80\x99s house twenty and two captains.\r\n\r\n12:29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three\r\nthousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of\r\nthe house of Saul.\r\n\r\n12:30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight\r\nhundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n12:31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were\r\nexpressed by name, to come and make David king.\r\n\r\n12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had\r\nunderstanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads\r\nof them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their\r\ncommandment.\r\n\r\n12:33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with\r\nall instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they\r\nwere not of double heart.\r\n\r\n12:34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield\r\nand spear thirty and seven thousand.\r\n\r\n12:35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and\r\nsix hundred.\r\n\r\n12:36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n12:37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the\r\nGadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of\r\ninstruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.\r\n\r\n12:38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect\r\nheart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest\r\nalso of Israel were of one heart to make David king.\r\n\r\n12:39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:\r\nfor their brethren had prepared for them.\r\n\r\n12:40 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and\r\nZebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on\r\nmules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of\r\nraisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there\r\nwas joy in Israel.\r\n\r\n13:1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,\r\nand with every leader.\r\n\r\n13:2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem\r\ngood unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad\r\nunto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of\r\nIsrael, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in\r\ntheir cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:\r\n13:3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired\r\nnot at it in the days of Saul.\r\n\r\n13:4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the\r\nthing was right in the eyes of all the people.\r\n\r\n13:5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even\r\nunto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from\r\nKirjathjearim.\r\n\r\n13:6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to\r\nKirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of\r\nGod the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is\r\ncalled on it.\r\n\r\n13:7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of\r\nAbinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.\r\n\r\n13:8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,\r\nand with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with\r\ntimbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.\r\n\r\n13:9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put\r\nforth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.\r\n\r\n13:10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote\r\nhim, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.\r\n\r\n13:11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach\r\nupon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.\r\n\r\n13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring\r\nthe ark of God home to me?  13:13 So David brought not the ark home to\r\nhimself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of\r\nObededom the Gittite.\r\n\r\n13:14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his\r\nhouse three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and\r\nall that he had.\r\n\r\n14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of\r\ncedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.\r\n\r\n14:2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over\r\nIsrael, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n14:3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons\r\nand daughters.\r\n\r\n14:4 Now these are the names of his children which he had in\r\nJerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 14:5 And Ibhar,\r\nand Elishua, and Elpalet, 14:6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 14:7\r\nAnd Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.\r\n\r\n14:8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over\r\nall Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard\r\nof it, and went out against them.\r\n\r\n14:9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of\r\nRephaim.\r\n\r\n14:10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the\r\nPhilistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD\r\nsaid unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.\r\n\r\n14:11 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then\r\nDavid said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the\r\nbreaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place\r\nBaalperazim.\r\n\r\n14:12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a\r\ncommandment, and they were burned with fire.\r\n\r\n14:13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n14:14 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go\r\nnot up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over\r\nagainst the mulberry trees.\r\n\r\n14:15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the\r\ntops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for\r\nGod is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n14:16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the\r\nhost of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.\r\n\r\n14:17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD\r\nbrought the fear of him upon all nations.\r\n\r\n15:1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a\r\nplace for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.\r\n\r\n15:2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the\r\nLevites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to\r\nminister unto him for ever.\r\n\r\n15:3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up\r\nthe ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.\r\n\r\n15:4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5\r\nOf the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred\r\nand twenty: 15:6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his\r\nbrethren two hundred and twenty: 15:7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the\r\nchief and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 15:8 Of the sons of\r\nElizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 15:9 Of\r\nthe sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 15:10\r\nOf the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an\r\nhundred and twelve.\r\n\r\n15:11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the\r\nLevites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and\r\nAmminadab, 15:12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers\r\nof the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that\r\nye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that\r\nI have prepared for it.\r\n\r\n15:13 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a\r\nbreach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.\r\n\r\n15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up\r\nthe ark of the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n15:15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their\r\nshoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the\r\nword of the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their\r\nbrethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and\r\nharps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.\r\n\r\n15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his\r\nbrethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their\r\nbrethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 15:18 And with them their\r\nbrethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and\r\nShemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah,\r\nand Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel,\r\nthe porters.\r\n\r\n15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound\r\nwith cymbals of brass; 15:20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and\r\nShemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and\r\nBenaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 15:21 And Mattithiah, and\r\nElipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with\r\nharps on the Sheminith to excel.\r\n\r\n15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed\r\nabout the song, because he was skilful.\r\n\r\n15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.\r\n\r\n15:24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and\r\nZechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the\r\ntrumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were\r\ndoorkeepers for the ark.\r\n\r\n15:25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over\r\nthousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of\r\nthe house of Obededom with joy.\r\n\r\n15:26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the\r\nark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and\r\nseven rams.\r\n\r\n15:27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the\r\nLevites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master\r\nof the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of\r\nlinen.\r\n\r\n15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD\r\nwith shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and\r\nwith cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.\r\n\r\n15:29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came\r\nto the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at\r\na window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\n16:1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the\r\ntent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices\r\nand peace offerings before God.\r\n\r\n16:2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings\r\nand the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n16:3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every\r\none a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.\r\n\r\n16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the\r\nark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God\r\nof Israel: 16:5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and\r\nShemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and\r\nObededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a\r\nsound with cymbals; 16:6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with\r\ntrumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.\r\n\r\n16:7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the\r\nLORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.\r\n\r\n16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his\r\ndeeds among the people.\r\n\r\n16:9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n16:10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that\r\nseek the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.\r\n\r\n16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,\r\nand the judgments of his mouth; 16:13 O ye seed of Israel his servant,\r\nye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.\r\n\r\n16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.\r\n\r\n16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he\r\ncommanded to a thousand generations; 16:16 Even of the covenant which\r\nhe made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 16:17 And hath\r\nconfirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an\r\neverlasting covenant, 16:18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of\r\nCanaan, the lot of your inheritance; 16:19 When ye were but few, even\r\na few, and strangers in it.\r\n\r\n16:20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom\r\nto another people; 16:21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he\r\nreproved kings for their sakes, 16:22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed,\r\nand do my prophets no harm.\r\n\r\n16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day\r\nhis salvation.\r\n\r\n16:24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\n16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to\r\nbe feared above all gods.\r\n\r\n16:26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n16:27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are\r\nin his place.\r\n\r\n16:28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the\r\nLORD glory and strength.\r\n\r\n16:29 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an\r\noffering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of\r\nholiness.\r\n\r\n16:30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable,\r\nthat it be not moved.\r\n\r\n16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men\r\nsay among the nations, The LORD reigneth.\r\n\r\n16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields\r\nrejoice, and all that is therein.\r\n\r\n16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the\r\nLORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.\r\n\r\n16:34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy\r\nendureth for ever.\r\n\r\n16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us\r\ntogether, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to\r\nthy holy name, and glory in thy praise.\r\n\r\n16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the\r\npeople said, Amen, and praised the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD\r\nAsaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as\r\nevery day\xe2\x80\x99s work required: 16:38 And Obededom with their brethren,\r\nthreescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to\r\nbe porters: 16:39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests,\r\nbefore the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at\r\nGibeon, 16:40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of\r\nthe burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do\r\naccording to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he\r\ncommanded Israel; 16:41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest\r\nthat were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the\r\nLORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; 16:42 And with them Heman\r\nand Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a\r\nsound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun\r\nwere porters.\r\n\r\n16:43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David\r\nreturned to bless his house.\r\n\r\n17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said\r\nto Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark\r\nof the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.\r\n\r\n17:2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for\r\nGod is with thee.\r\n\r\n17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to\r\nNathan, saying, 17:4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the\r\nLORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 17:5 For I have\r\nnot dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this\r\nday; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any\r\nof the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying,\r\nWhy have ye not built me an house of cedars?  17:7 Now therefore thus\r\nshalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I\r\ntook thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou\r\nshouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 17:8 And I have been with\r\nthee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine\r\nenemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of\r\nthe great men that are in the earth.\r\n\r\n17:9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant\r\nthem, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more;\r\nneither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at\r\nthe beginning, 17:10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be\r\nover my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.\r\nFurthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.\r\n\r\n17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou\r\nmust go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after\r\nthee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.\r\n\r\n17:12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for\r\never.\r\n\r\n17:13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not\r\ntake my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before\r\nthee: 17:14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for\r\never: and his throne shall be established for evermore.\r\n\r\n17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,\r\nso did Nathan speak unto David.\r\n\r\n17:16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who\r\nam I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me\r\nhitherto?  17:17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God;\r\nfor thou hast also spoken of thy servant\xe2\x80\x99s house for a great while to\r\ncome, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high\r\ndegree, O LORD God.\r\n\r\n17:18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?\r\nfor thou knowest thy servant.\r\n\r\n17:19 O LORD, for thy servant\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and according to thine own\r\nheart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these\r\ngreat things.\r\n\r\n17:20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside\r\nthee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.\r\n\r\n17:21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom\r\nGod went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of\r\ngreatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy\r\npeople whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?  17:22 For thy people\r\nIsrael didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD,\r\nbecamest their God.\r\n\r\n17:23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken\r\nconcerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for\r\never, and do as thou hast said.\r\n\r\n17:24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for\r\never, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to\r\nIsrael: and let the house of David thy servant be established before\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n17:25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build\r\nhim an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray\r\nbefore thee.\r\n\r\n17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness\r\nunto thy servant: 17:27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the\r\nhouse of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou\r\nblessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.\r\n\r\n18:1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,\r\nand subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and\r\nbrought gifts.\r\n\r\n18:3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went\r\nto stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.\r\n\r\n18:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand\r\nhorsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the\r\nchariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.\r\n\r\n18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of\r\nZobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\n18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David\r\nwhithersoever he went.\r\n\r\n18:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of\r\nHadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,\r\nbrought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea,\r\nand the pillars, and the vessels of brass.\r\n\r\n18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the\r\nhost of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 18:10 He sent Hadoram his son to king\r\nDavid, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he\r\nhad fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war\r\nwith Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n18:11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver\r\nand the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and\r\nfrom Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines,\r\nand from Amalek.\r\n\r\n18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the\r\nvalley of salt eighteen thousand.\r\n\r\n18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.\r\n\r\n18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and\r\njustice among all his people.\r\n\r\n18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat\r\nthe son of Ahilud, recorder.\r\n\r\n18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,\r\nwere the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 18:17 And Benaiah the son of\r\nJehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of\r\nDavid were chief about the king.\r\n\r\n19:1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the\r\nchildren of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n19:2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of\r\nNahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent\r\nmessengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of\r\nDavid came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n19:3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest\r\nthou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters\r\nunto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to\r\noverthrow, and to spy out the land?  19:4 Wherefore Hanun took David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst\r\nhard by their buttocks, and sent them away.\r\n\r\n19:5 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.\r\nAnd he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the\r\nking said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n19:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves\r\nodious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand\r\ntalents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of\r\nMesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.\r\n\r\n19:7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of\r\nMaachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the\r\nchildren of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and\r\ncame to battle.\r\n\r\n19:8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the\r\nmighty men.\r\n\r\n19:9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array\r\nbefore the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by\r\nthemselves in the field.\r\n\r\n19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and\r\nbehind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in\r\narray against the Syrians.\r\n\r\n19:11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai\r\nhis brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of\r\nAmmon.\r\n\r\n19:12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou\r\nshalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee,\r\nthen I will help thee.\r\n\r\n19:13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for\r\nour people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that\r\nwhich is good in his sight.\r\n\r\n19:14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the\r\nSyrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.\r\n\r\n19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,\r\nthey likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the\r\ncity. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n19:16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before\r\nIsrael, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were\r\nbeyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer\r\nwent before them.\r\n\r\n19:17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed\r\nover Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against\r\nthem. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians,\r\nthey fought with him.\r\n\r\n19:18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the\r\nSyrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty\r\nthousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.\r\n\r\n19:19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the\r\nworse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his\r\nservants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n20:1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time\r\nthat kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and\r\nwasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged\r\nRabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and\r\ndestroyed it.\r\n\r\n20:2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and\r\nfound it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in\r\nit; and it was set upon David\xe2\x80\x99s head: and he brought also exceeding\r\nmuch spoil out of the city.\r\n\r\n20:3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with\r\nsaws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David\r\nwith all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the\r\npeople returned to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n20:4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer\r\nwith the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew\r\nSippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.\r\n\r\n20:5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son\r\nof Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear\r\nstaff was like a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s beam.\r\n\r\n20:6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great\r\nstature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each\r\nhand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.\r\n\r\n20:7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother slew him.\r\n\r\n20:8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand\r\nof David, and by the hand of his servants.\r\n\r\n21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,\r\nnumber Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them\r\nto me, that I may know it.\r\n\r\n21:3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so\r\nmany more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my\r\nlord\xe2\x80\x99s servants?  why then doth my lord require this thing? why will\r\nhe be a cause of trespass to Israel?  21:4 Nevertheless the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nword prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went\r\nthroughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And\r\nall they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand\r\nmen that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten\r\nthousand men that drew sword.\r\n\r\n21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nword was abominable to Joab.\r\n\r\n21:7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have\r\ndone this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy\r\nservant; for I have done very foolishly.\r\n\r\n21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David\xe2\x80\x99s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and\r\ntell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things:\r\nchoose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.\r\n\r\n21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,\r\nChoose thee 21:12 Either three years\xe2\x80\x99 famine; or three months to be\r\ndestroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies\r\novertaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the\r\npestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying\r\nthroughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what\r\nword I shall bring again to him that sent me.\r\n\r\n21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now\r\ninto the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me\r\nnot fall into the hand of man.\r\n\r\n21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of\r\nIsrael seventy thousand men.\r\n\r\n21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he\r\nwas destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and\r\nsaid to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.\r\nAnd the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the\r\nJebusite.\r\n\r\n21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD\r\nstand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his\r\nhand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of\r\nIsrael, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.\r\n\r\n21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people\r\nto be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed;\r\nbut as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray\r\nthee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father\xe2\x80\x99s house; but not on\r\nthy people, that they should be plagued.\r\n\r\n21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that\r\nDavid should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the\r\nthreshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.\r\n\r\n21:19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the\r\nname of the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with\r\nhim hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.\r\n\r\n21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went\r\nout of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n21:22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this\r\nthreshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou\r\nshalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed\r\nfrom the people.\r\n\r\n21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the\r\nking do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also\r\nfor burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the\r\nwheat for the meat offering; I give it all.\r\n\r\n21:24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for\r\nthe full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD,\r\nnor offer burnt offerings without cost.\r\n\r\n21:25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold\r\nby weight.\r\n\r\n21:26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt\r\nofferings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he\r\nanswered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.\r\n\r\n21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again\r\ninto the sheath thereof.\r\n\r\n21:28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in\r\nthe threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.\r\n\r\n21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the\r\nwilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season\r\nin the high place at Gibeon.\r\n\r\n21:30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was\r\nafraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:1 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is\r\nthe altar of the burnt offering for Israel.\r\n\r\n22:2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in\r\nthe land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build\r\nthe house of God.\r\n\r\n22:3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors\r\nof the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without\r\nweight; 22:4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they\r\nof Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.\r\n\r\n22:5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house\r\nthat is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of\r\nfame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make\r\npreparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.\r\n\r\n22:6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an\r\nhouse for the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind\r\nto build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 22:8 But the word\r\nof the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and\r\nhast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name,\r\nbecause thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.\r\n\r\n22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;\r\nand I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his\r\nname shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel\r\nin his days.\r\n\r\n22:10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and\r\nI will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom\r\nover Israel for ever.\r\n\r\n22:11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build\r\nthe house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.\r\n\r\n22:12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee\r\ncharge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD\r\nthy God.\r\n\r\n22:13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the\r\nstatutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning\r\nIsrael: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.\r\n\r\n22:14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the\r\nLORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand\r\ntalents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in\r\nabundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\n22:15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and\r\nworkers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every\r\nmanner of work.\r\n\r\n22:16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is\r\nno number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.\r\n\r\n22:17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon\r\nhis son, saying, 22:18 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he\r\nnot given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of\r\nthe land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and\r\nbefore his people.\r\n\r\n22:19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;\r\narise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring\r\nthe ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into\r\nthe house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son\r\nking over Israel.\r\n\r\n23:2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the\r\npriests and the Levites.\r\n\r\n23:3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and\r\nupward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and\r\neight thousand.\r\n\r\n23:4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work\r\nof the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:\r\n23:5 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised\r\nthe LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n23:6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,\r\nnamely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\r\n\r\n23:7 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.\r\n\r\n23:8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n23:9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.\r\nThese were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.\r\n\r\n23:10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and\r\nBeriah.\r\n\r\nThese four were the sons of Shimei.\r\n\r\n23:11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and\r\nBeriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning,\r\naccording to their father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n23:12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.\r\n\r\n23:13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,\r\nthat he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for\r\never, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to\r\nbless in his name for ever.\r\n\r\n23:14 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the\r\ntribe of Levi.\r\n\r\n23:15 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.\r\n\r\n23:16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.\r\n\r\n23:17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer\r\nhad none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.\r\n\r\n23:18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.\r\n\r\n23:19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,\r\nJahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.\r\n\r\n23:20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.\r\n\r\n23:21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;\r\nEleazar, and Kish.\r\n\r\n23:22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their\r\nbrethren the sons of Kish took them.\r\n\r\n23:23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.\r\n\r\n23:24 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;\r\neven the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names\r\nby their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the\r\nLORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.\r\n\r\n23:25 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his\r\npeople, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: 23:26 And also unto\r\nthe Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels\r\nof it for the service thereof.\r\n\r\n23:27 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from\r\ntwenty years old and above: 23:28 Because their office was to wait on\r\nthe sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the\r\ncourts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things,\r\nand the work of the service of the house of God; 23:29 Both for the\r\nshewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the\r\nunleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that\r\nwhich is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; 23:30 And to\r\nstand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at\r\neven: 23:31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the\r\nsabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,\r\naccording to the order commanded unto them, continually before the\r\nLORD: 23:32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of\r\nthe congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of\r\nthe sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n24:1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of\r\nAaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.\r\n\r\n24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no\r\nchildren: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n24:3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,\r\nand Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n24:4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than\r\nof the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of\r\nEleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers,\r\nand eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n24:5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the\r\ngovernors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of\r\nthe sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.\r\n\r\n24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,\r\nwrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and\r\nAhimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of\r\nthe priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for\r\nEleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.\r\n\r\n24:7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,\r\n24:8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 24:9 The fifth to\r\nMalchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 24:10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the\r\neighth to Abijah, 24:11 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,\r\n24:12 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 24:13 The\r\nthirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 24:14 The fifteenth\r\nto Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 24:15 The seventeenth to Hezir, the\r\neighteenth to Aphses, 24:16 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth\r\nto Jehezekel, 24:17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and\r\ntwentieth to Gamul, 24:18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four\r\nand twentieth to Maaziah.\r\n\r\n24:19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into\r\nthe house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their\r\nfather, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.\r\n\r\n24:20 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of\r\nAmram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.\r\n\r\n24:21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was\r\nIsshiah.\r\n\r\n24:22 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.\r\n\r\n24:23 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,\r\nJahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.\r\n\r\n24:24 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.\r\n\r\n24:25 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;\r\nZechariah.\r\n\r\n24:26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;\r\nBeno.\r\n\r\n24:27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and\r\nIbri.\r\n\r\n24:28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.\r\n\r\n24:29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.\r\n\r\n24:30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These\r\nwere the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.\r\n\r\n24:31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of\r\nAaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and\r\nthe chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the\r\nprincipal fathers over against their younger brethren.\r\n\r\n25:1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the\r\nservice of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who\r\nshould prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the\r\nnumber of the workmen according to their service was: 25:2 Of the sons\r\nof Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of\r\nAsaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the\r\norder of the king.\r\n\r\n25:3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and\r\nJeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their\r\nfather Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to\r\npraise the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:4 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel,\r\nand Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer,\r\nJoshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth: 25:5 All these were the\r\nsons of Heman the king\xe2\x80\x99s seer in the words of God, to lift up the\r\nhorn.

and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and\r\namong the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all\r\nIsrael: 28:5 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many\r\nsons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the\r\nkingdom of the LORD over Israel.\r\n\r\n28:6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and\r\nmy courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n28:7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant\r\nto do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.\r\n\r\n28:8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the\r\nLORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the\r\ncommandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land,\r\nand leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.\r\n\r\n28:9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and\r\nserve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD\r\nsearcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the\r\nthoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou\r\nforsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.\r\n\r\n28:10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house\r\nfor the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.\r\n\r\n28:11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and\r\nof the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper\r\nchambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place\r\nof the mercy seat, 28:12 And the pattern of all that he had by the\r\nspirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the\r\nchambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of\r\nthe treasuries of the dedicated things: 28:13 Also for the courses of\r\nthe priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of\r\nthe house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n28:14 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all\r\ninstruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments\r\nof silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:\r\n28:15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their\r\nlamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps\r\nthereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the\r\ncandlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of\r\nevery candlestick.\r\n\r\n28:16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for\r\nevery table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 28:17 Also\r\npure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the\r\ngolden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise\r\nsilver by weight for every bason of silver: 28:18 And for the altar of\r\nincense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the\r\nchariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the\r\nark of the covenant of the LORD.\r\n\r\n28:19 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by\r\nhis hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.\r\n\r\n28:20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good\r\ncourage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even\r\nmy God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee,\r\nuntil thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n28:21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even\r\nthey shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and\r\nthere shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing\r\nskilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the\r\npeople will be wholly at thy commandment.\r\n\r\n29:1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,\r\nSolomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender,\r\nand the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n29:2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the\r\ngold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of\r\nsilver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of\r\niron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set,\r\nglistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious\r\nstones, and marble stones in abundance.\r\n\r\n29:3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God,\r\nI have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given\r\nto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for\r\nthe holy house.\r\n\r\n29:4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and\r\nseven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the\r\nhouses withal: 29:5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for\r\nthings of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands\r\nof artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this\r\nday unto the LORD?  29:6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of\r\nthe tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds,\r\nwith the rulers of the king\xe2\x80\x99s work, offered willingly, 29:7 And gave\r\nfor the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and\r\nten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass\r\neighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.\r\n\r\n29:8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the\r\ntreasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the\r\nGershonite.\r\n\r\n29:9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,\r\nbecause with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and\r\nDavid the king also rejoiced with great joy.\r\n\r\n29:10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:\r\nand David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for\r\never and ever.\r\n\r\n29:11 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,\r\nand the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in\r\nthe earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted\r\nas head above all.\r\n\r\n29:12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;\r\nand in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make\r\ngreat, and to give strength unto all.\r\n\r\n29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious\r\nname.\r\n\r\n29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to\r\noffer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and\r\nof thine own have we given thee.\r\n\r\n29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all\r\nour fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none\r\nabiding.\r\n\r\n29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build\r\nthee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all\r\nthine own.\r\n\r\n29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast\r\npleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I\r\nhave willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy\r\nthy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.\r\n\r\n29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep\r\nthis for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy\r\npeople, and prepare their heart unto thee: 29:19 And give unto Solomon\r\nmy son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and\r\nthy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for\r\nthe which I have made provision.\r\n\r\n29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nAnd all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and\r\nbowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.\r\n\r\n29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt\r\nofferings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand\r\nbullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink\r\nofferings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 29:22 And did\r\neat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And\r\nthey made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed\r\nhim unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.\r\n\r\n29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of\r\nDavid his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.\r\n\r\n29:24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons\r\nlikewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.\r\n\r\n29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all\r\nIsrael, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on\r\nany king before him in Israel.\r\n\r\n29:26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.\r\n\r\n29:27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven\r\nyears reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:\r\nand Solomon his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n29:29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are\r\nwritten in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the\r\nprophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 29:30 With all his reign and\r\nhis might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over\r\nall the kingdoms of the countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Book of the Chronicles\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and\r\nthe LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.\r\n\r\n1:2 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands\r\nand of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all\r\nIsrael, the chief of the fathers.\r\n\r\n1:3 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high\r\nplace that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\n1:4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the\r\nplace which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for\r\nit at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:5 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son\r\nof Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and\r\nSolomon and the congregation sought unto it.\r\n\r\n1:6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,\r\nwhich was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a\r\nthousand burnt offerings upon it.\r\n\r\n1:7 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask\r\nwhat I shall give thee.\r\n\r\n1:8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David\r\nmy father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.\r\n\r\n1:9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be\r\nestablished: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of\r\nthe earth in multitude.\r\n\r\n1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in\r\nbefore this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so\r\ngreat?  1:11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart,\r\nand thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of\r\nthine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom\r\nand knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom\r\nI have made thee king: 1:12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee;\r\nand I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of\r\nthe kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any\r\nafter thee have the like.\r\n\r\n1:13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at\r\nGibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation,\r\nand reigned over Israel.\r\n\r\n1:14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand\r\nand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he\r\nplaced in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as\r\nstones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the\r\nvale for abundance.\r\n\r\n1:16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\r\n\r\n1:17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for\r\nsix hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty:\r\nand so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and\r\nfor the kings of Syria, by their means.\r\n\r\n2:1 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD,\r\nand an house for his kingdom.\r\n\r\n2:2 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear\r\nburdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three\r\nthousand and six hundred to oversee them.\r\n\r\n2:3 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst\r\ndeal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an\r\nhouse to dwell therein, even so deal with me.\r\n\r\n2:4 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to\r\ndedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the\r\ncontinual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening,\r\non the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the\r\nLORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.\r\n\r\n2:5 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above\r\nall gods.\r\n\r\n2:6 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and\r\nheaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should\r\nbuild him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?  2:7 Send\r\nme now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in\r\nbrass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can\r\nskill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in\r\nJerusalem, whom David my father did provide.\r\n\r\n2:8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of\r\nLebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in\r\nLebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, 2:9 Even\r\nto prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to\r\nbuild shall be wonderful great.\r\n\r\n2:10 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut\r\ntimber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand\r\nmeasures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty\r\nthousand baths of oil.\r\n\r\n2:11 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to\r\nSolomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee\r\nking over them.\r\n\r\n2:12 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made\r\nheaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued\r\nwith prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the\r\nLORD, and an house for his kingdom.\r\n\r\n2:13 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of\r\nHuram my father\xe2\x80\x99s, 2:14 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan,\r\nand his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in\r\nsilver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in\r\nblue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of\r\ngraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with\r\nthy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.\r\n\r\n2:15 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,\r\nwhich my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 2:16 And\r\nwe will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we\r\nwill bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry\r\nit up to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2:17 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of\r\nIsrael, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered\r\nthem; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three\r\nthousand and six hundred.\r\n\r\n2:18 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of\r\nburdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and\r\nthree thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.\r\n\r\n3:1 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in\r\nmount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the\r\nplace that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the\r\nJebusite.\r\n\r\n3:2 And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in\r\nthe fourth year of his reign.\r\n\r\n3:3 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the\r\nbuilding of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first\r\nmeasure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.\r\n\r\n3:4 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it\r\nwas according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the\r\nheight was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n3:5 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid\r\nwith fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.\r\n\r\n3:6 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and\r\nthe gold was gold of Parvaim.\r\n\r\n3:7 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls\r\nthereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n3:8 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according\r\nto the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof\r\ntwenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six\r\nhundred talents.\r\n\r\n3:9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he\r\noverlaid the upper chambers with gold.\r\n\r\n3:10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,\r\nand overlaid them with gold.\r\n\r\n3:11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing\r\nof the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house:\r\nand the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of\r\nthe other cherub.\r\n\r\n3:12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the\r\nwall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to\r\nthe wing of the other cherub.\r\n\r\n3:13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty\r\ncubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.\r\n\r\n3:14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine\r\nlinen, and wrought cherubims thereon.\r\n\r\n3:15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five\r\ncubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was\r\nfive cubits.\r\n\r\n3:16 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads\r\nof the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the\r\nchains.\r\n\r\n3:17 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right\r\nhand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the\r\nright hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.\r\n\r\n4:1 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length\r\nthereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the\r\nheight thereof.\r\n\r\n4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round\r\nin compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty\r\ncubits did compass it round about.\r\n\r\n4:3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it\r\nround about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows\r\nof oxen were cast, when it was cast.\r\n\r\n4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and\r\nthree looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and\r\nthree looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,\r\nand all their hinder parts were inward.\r\n\r\n4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it\r\nlike the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it\r\nreceived and held three thousand baths.\r\n\r\n4:6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five\r\non the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the\r\nburnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to\r\nwash in.\r\n\r\n4:7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and\r\nset them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.\r\n\r\n4:8 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on\r\nthe right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,\r\nand doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.\r\n\r\n4:10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over\r\nagainst the south.\r\n\r\n4:11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And\r\nHuram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the\r\nhouse of God; 4:12 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the\r\nchapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two\r\nwreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the\r\ntop of the pillars; 4:13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two\r\nwreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two\r\npommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.\r\n\r\n4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15 One\r\nsea, and twelve oxen under it.\r\n\r\n4:16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their\r\ninstruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house\r\nof the LORD of bright brass.\r\n\r\n4:17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground\r\nbetween Succoth and Zeredathah.\r\n\r\n4:18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the\r\nweight of the brass could not be found out.\r\n\r\n4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,\r\nthe golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;\r\n4:20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn\r\nafter the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 4:21 And the\r\nflowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that\r\nperfect gold; 4:22 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons,\r\nand the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner\r\ndoors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of\r\nthe temple, were of gold.\r\n\r\n5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was\r\nfinished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father\r\nhad dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments,\r\nput he among the treasures of the house of God.\r\n\r\n5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of\r\nthe tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto\r\nJerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the\r\ncity of David, which is Zion.\r\n\r\n5:3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king\r\nin the feast which was in the seventh month.\r\n\r\n5:4 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the\r\nark.\r\n\r\n5:5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the\r\ncongregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,\r\nthese did the priests and the Levites bring up.\r\n\r\n5:6 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were\r\nassembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which\r\ncould not be told nor numbered for multitude.\r\n\r\n5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD\r\nunto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,\r\neven under the wings of the cherubims: 5:8 For the cherubims spread\r\nforth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered\r\nthe ark and the staves thereof above.\r\n\r\n5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the\r\nstaves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not\r\nseen without. And there it is unto this day.\r\n\r\n5:10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put\r\ntherein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of\r\nIsrael, when they came out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy\r\nplace: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did\r\nnot then wait by course: 5:12 Also the Levites which were the singers,\r\nall of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their\r\nbrethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries\r\nand harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an\r\nhundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 5:13 It came even\r\nto pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound\r\nto be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up\r\ntheir voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick,\r\nand praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth\r\nfor ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house\r\nof the LORD; 5:14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by\r\nreason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n6:1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the\r\nthick darkness.\r\n\r\n6:2 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for\r\nthy dwelling for ever.\r\n\r\n6:3 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation\r\nof Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.\r\n\r\n6:4 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his\r\nhands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David,\r\nsaying, 6:5 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the\r\nland of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build\r\nan house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to\r\nbe a ruler over my people Israel: 6:6 But I have chosen Jerusalem,\r\nthat my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my\r\npeople Israel.\r\n\r\n6:7 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for\r\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n6:8 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine\r\nheart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in\r\nthine heart: 6:9 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but\r\nthy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the\r\nhouse for my name.\r\n\r\n6:10 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:\r\nfor I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the\r\nthrone of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for\r\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n6:11 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the\r\nLORD, that he made with the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n6:12 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all\r\nthe congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 6:13 For\r\nSolomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five\r\ncubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of\r\nthe court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees\r\nbefore all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands\r\ntoward heaven.\r\n\r\n6:14 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the\r\nheaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy\r\nunto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: 6:15\r\nThou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou\r\nhast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it\r\nwith thine hand, as it is this day.\r\n\r\n6:16 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David\r\nmy father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not\r\nfail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so\r\nthat thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou\r\nhast walked before me.\r\n\r\n6:17 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which\r\nthou hast spoken unto thy servant David.\r\n\r\n6:18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,\r\nheaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less\r\nthis house which I have built!  6:19 Have respect therefore to the\r\nprayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to\r\nhearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before\r\nthee: 6:20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,\r\nupon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name\r\nthere; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n6:21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of\r\nthy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou\r\nfrom thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest,\r\nforgive.\r\n\r\n6:22 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him\r\nto make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;\r\n6:23 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by\r\nrequiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and\r\nby justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n6:24 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,\r\nbecause they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess\r\nthy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;\r\n6:25 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy\r\npeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to\r\nthem and to their fathers.\r\n\r\n6:26 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they\r\nhave sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and\r\nconfess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict\r\nthem; 6:27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy\r\nservants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the\r\ngood way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which\r\nthou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.\r\n\r\n6:28 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there\r\nbe blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies\r\nbesiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or\r\nwhatsoever sickness there be: 6:29 Then what prayer or what\r\nsupplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people\r\nIsrael, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and\r\nshall spread forth his hands in this house: 6:30 Then hear thou from\r\nheaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man\r\naccording unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only\r\nknowest the hearts of the children of men:) 6:31 That they may fear\r\nthee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou\r\ngavest unto our fathers.\r\n\r\n6:32 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people\r\nIsrael, but is come from a far country for thy great name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and\r\nthy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in\r\nthis house; 6:33 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy\r\ndwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to\r\nthee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear\r\nthee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I\r\nhave built is called by thy name.\r\n\r\n6:34 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that\r\nthou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which\r\nthou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; 6:35\r\nThen hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication,\r\nand maintain their cause.\r\n\r\n6:36 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth\r\nnot,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their\r\nenemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or\r\nnear; 6:37 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are\r\ncarried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their\r\ncaptivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt\r\nwickedly; 6:38 If they return to thee with all their heart and with\r\nall their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have\r\ncarried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest\r\nunto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and\r\ntoward the house which I have built for thy name: 6:39 Then hear thou\r\nfrom the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their\r\nsupplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which\r\nhave sinned against thee.\r\n\r\n6:40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let\r\nthine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.\r\n\r\n6:41 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,\r\nand the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed\r\nwith salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.\r\n\r\n6:42 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember\r\nthe mercies of David thy servant.\r\n\r\n7:1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down\r\nfrom heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and\r\nthe glory of the LORD filled the house.\r\n\r\n7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,\r\nbecause the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n7:3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,\r\nand the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with\r\ntheir faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and\r\npraised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for\r\never.\r\n\r\n7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand\r\noxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all\r\nthe people dedicated the house of God.\r\n\r\n7:6 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with\r\ninstruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to\r\npraise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David\r\npraised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before\r\nthem, and all Israel stood.\r\n\r\n7:7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before\r\nthe house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the\r\nfat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had\r\nmade was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat\r\nofferings, and the fat.\r\n\r\n7:8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all\r\nIsrael with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of\r\nHamath unto the river of Egypt.\r\n\r\n7:9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept\r\nthe dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.\r\n\r\n7:10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent\r\nthe people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the\r\ngoodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to\r\nIsrael his people.\r\n\r\n7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse: and all that came into Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s heart to make in the house of\r\nthe LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.\r\n\r\n7:12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I\r\nhave heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an\r\nhouse of sacrifice.\r\n\r\n7:13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the\r\nlocusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;\r\n7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble\r\nthemselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked\r\nways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and\r\nwill heal their land.\r\n\r\n7:15 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer\r\nthat is made in this place.\r\n\r\n7:16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may\r\nbe there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there\r\nperpetually.\r\n\r\n7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father\r\nwalked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt\r\nobserve my statutes and my judgments; 7:18 Then will I stablish the\r\nthrone of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy\r\nfather, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.\r\n\r\n7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,\r\nwhich I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and\r\nworship them; 7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my\r\nland which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified\r\nfor my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a\r\nproverb and a byword among all nations.\r\n\r\n7:21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every\r\none that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done\r\nthus unto this land, and unto this house?  7:22 And it shall be\r\nanswered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which\r\nbrought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other\r\ngods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought\r\nall this evil upon them.\r\n\r\n8:1 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon\r\nhad built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 8:2 That the\r\ncities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and\r\ncaused the children of Israel to dwell there.\r\n\r\n8:3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.\r\n\r\n8:4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,\r\nwhich he built in Hamath.\r\n\r\n8:5 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,\r\nfenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 8:6 And Baalath, and all\r\nthe store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the\r\ncities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in\r\nJerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\n8:7 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the\r\nAmorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,\r\nwhich were not of Israel, 8:8 But of their children, who were left\r\nafter them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them\r\ndid Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.\r\n\r\n8:9 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his\r\nwork; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and\r\ncaptains of his chariots and horsemen.\r\n\r\n8:10 And these were the chief of king Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s officers, even two\r\nhundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.\r\n\r\n8:11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of\r\nDavid unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife\r\nshall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the\r\nplaces are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.\r\n\r\n8:12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar\r\nof the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 8:13 Even after a\r\ncertain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of\r\nMoses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn\r\nfeasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened\r\nbread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.\r\n\r\n8:14 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the\r\ncourses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their\r\ncharges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of\r\nevery day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate:\r\nfor so had David the man of God commanded.\r\n\r\n8:15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the\r\npriests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n8:16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the\r\nfoundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the\r\nhouse of the LORD was perfected.\r\n\r\n8:17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in\r\nthe land of Edom.\r\n\r\n8:18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and\r\nservants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the\r\nservants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty\r\ntalents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.\r\n\r\n9:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came\r\nto prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great\r\ncompany, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and\r\nprecious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with\r\nhim of all that was in her heart.\r\n\r\n9:2 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid\r\nfrom Solomon which he told her not.\r\n\r\n9:3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and\r\nthe house that he had built, 9:4 And the meat of his table, and the\r\nsitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and\r\ntheir apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent\r\nby which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more\r\nspirit in her.\r\n\r\n9:5 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in\r\nmine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 9:6 Howbeit I believed\r\nnot their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold,\r\nthe one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou\r\nexceedest the fame that I heard.\r\n\r\n9:7 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand\r\ncontinually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.\r\n\r\n9:8 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee\r\non his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved\r\nIsrael, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over\r\nthem, to do judgment and justice.\r\n\r\n9:9 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and\r\nof spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any\r\nsuch spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.\r\n\r\n9:10 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,\r\nwhich brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n9:11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the\r\nLORD, and to the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers:\r\nand there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.\r\n\r\n9:12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,\r\nwhatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king.\r\nSo she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.\r\n\r\n9:13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six\r\nhundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 9:14 Beside that which\r\nchapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and\r\ngovernors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.\r\n\r\n9:15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six\r\nhundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.\r\n\r\n9:16 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred\r\nshekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house\r\nof the forest of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n9:17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it\r\nwith pure gold.\r\n\r\n9:18 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,\r\nwhich were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the\r\nsitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: 9:19 And twelve\r\nlions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps.\r\nThere was not the like made in any kingdom.\r\n\r\n9:20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and\r\nall the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure\r\ngold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the\r\ndays of Solomon.\r\n\r\n9:21 For the king\xe2\x80\x99s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:\r\nevery three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and\r\nsilver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\r\n\r\n9:22 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n9:23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to\r\nhear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.\r\n\r\n9:24 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and\r\nvessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules,\r\na rate year by year.\r\n\r\n9:25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and\r\ntwelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and\r\nwith the king at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n9:26 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the\r\nland of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.\r\n\r\n9:27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees\r\nmade he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.\r\n\r\n9:28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not\r\nwritten in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of\r\nAhijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against\r\nJeroboam the son of Nebat?  9:30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over\r\nall Israel forty years.\r\n\r\n9:31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city\r\nof David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n10:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come\r\nto make him king.\r\n\r\n10:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in\r\nEgypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard\r\nit, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n10:3 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and\r\nspake to Rehoboam, saying, 10:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now\r\ntherefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and\r\nhis heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.\r\n\r\n10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And\r\nthe people departed.\r\n\r\n10:6 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood\r\nbefore Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel\r\ngive ye me to return answer to this people?  10:7 And they spake unto\r\nhim, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and\r\nspeak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.\r\n\r\n10:8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took\r\ncounsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n10:9 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return\r\nanswer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat\r\nthe yoke that thy father did put upon us?  10:10 And the young men\r\nthat were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou\r\nanswer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our\r\nyoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou\r\nsay unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloins.\r\n\r\n10:11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more\r\nto your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise\r\nyou with scorpions.\r\n\r\n10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third\r\nday, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.\r\n\r\n10:13 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook\r\nthe counsel of the old men, 10:14 And answered them after the advice\r\nof the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will\r\nadd thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise\r\nyou with scorpions.\r\n\r\n10:15 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of\r\nGod, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand\r\nof Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\r\n\r\n10:16 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto\r\nthem, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in\r\nDavid?  and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to\r\nyour tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all\r\nIsrael went to their tents.\r\n\r\n10:17 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of\r\nJudah, Rehoboam reigned over them.\r\n\r\n10:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and\r\nthe children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king\r\nRehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n10:19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.\r\n\r\n11:1 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house\r\nof Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men,\r\nwhich were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the\r\nkingdom again to Rehoboam.\r\n\r\n11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,\r\n11:3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all\r\nIsrael in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 11:4 Thus saith the LORD, Ye\r\nshall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to\r\nhis house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of\r\nthe LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n11:5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n11:6 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 11:7 And Bethzur,\r\nand Shoco, and Adullam, 11:8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 11:9\r\nAnd Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 11:10 And Zorah, and Aijalon,\r\nand Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.\r\n\r\n11:11 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and\r\nstore of victual, and of oil and wine.\r\n\r\n11:12 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made\r\nthem exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.\r\n\r\n11:13 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted\r\nto him out of all their coasts.\r\n\r\n11:14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and\r\ncame to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them\r\noff from executing the priest\xe2\x80\x99s office unto the LORD: 11:15 And he\r\nordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for\r\nthe calves which he had made.\r\n\r\n11:16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their\r\nhearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice\r\nunto the LORD God of their fathers.\r\n\r\n11:17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the\r\nson of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the\r\nway of David and Solomon.\r\n\r\n11:18 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son\r\nof David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;\r\n11:19 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.\r\n\r\n11:20 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which\r\nbare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.\r\n\r\n11:21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his\r\nwives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore\r\nconcubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore\r\ndaughters.)  11:22 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the\r\nchief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him\r\nking.\r\n\r\n11:23 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children\r\nthroughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced\r\ncity: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n12:1 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,\r\nand had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all\r\nIsrael with him.\r\n\r\n12:2 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam\r\nShishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had\r\ntransgressed against the LORD, 12:3 With twelve hundred chariots, and\r\nthreescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that\r\ncame with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the\r\nEthiopians.\r\n\r\n12:4 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came\r\nto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:5 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of\r\nJudah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,\r\nand said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and\r\ntherefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.\r\n\r\n12:6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;\r\nand they said, The LORD is righteous.\r\n\r\n12:7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of\r\nthe LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;\r\ntherefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some\r\ndeliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by\r\nthe hand of Shishak.\r\n\r\n12:8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my\r\nservice, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.\r\n\r\n12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away\r\nthe treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold\r\nwhich Solomon had made.\r\n\r\n12:10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and\r\ncommitted them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the\r\nentrance of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n12:11 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard\r\ncame and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.\r\n\r\n12:12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from\r\nhim, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah\r\nthings went well.\r\n\r\n12:13 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:\r\nfor Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and\r\nhe reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had\r\nchosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.\r\n\r\n12:14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written\r\nin the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning\r\ngenealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\n12:16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city\r\nof David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n13:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign\r\nover Judah.\r\n\r\n13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s name also was\r\nMichaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between\r\nAbijah and Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n13:3 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of\r\nwar, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the\r\nbattle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,\r\nbeing mighty men of valour.\r\n\r\n13:4 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount\r\nEphraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; 13:5 Ought\r\nye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over\r\nIsrael to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of\r\nsalt?  13:6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the\r\nson of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.\r\n\r\n13:7 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,\r\nand have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,\r\nwhen Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n13:8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand\r\nof the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with\r\nyour golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.\r\n\r\n13:9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,\r\nand the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the\r\nnations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself\r\nwith a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them\r\nthat are no gods.\r\n\r\n13:10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken\r\nhim; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of\r\nAaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: 13:11 And they burn\r\nunto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and\r\nsweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure\r\ntable; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn\r\nevery evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have\r\nforsaken him.\r\n\r\n13:12 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his\r\npriests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of\r\nIsrael, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye\r\nshall not prosper.\r\n\r\n13:13 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so\r\nthey were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.\r\n\r\n13:14 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and\r\nbehind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the\r\ntrumpets.\r\n\r\n13:15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah\r\nshouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel\r\nbefore Abijah and Judah.\r\n\r\n13:16 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered\r\nthem into their hand.\r\n\r\n13:17 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so\r\nthere fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.\r\n\r\n13:18 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and\r\nthe children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God\r\nof their fathers.\r\n\r\n13:19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,\r\nBethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof,\r\nand Ephraim with the towns thereof.\r\n\r\n13:20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of\r\nAbijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.\r\n\r\n13:21 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat\r\ntwenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.\r\n\r\n13:22 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his\r\nsayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.\r\n\r\n14:1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city\r\nof David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land\r\nwas quiet ten years.\r\n\r\n14:2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD\r\nhis God: 14:3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the\r\nhigh places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 14:4\r\nAnd commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do\r\nthe law and the commandment.\r\n\r\n14:5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places\r\nand the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.\r\n\r\n14:6 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and\r\nhe had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.\r\n\r\n14:7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make\r\nabout them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet\r\nbefore us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought\r\nhim, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and\r\nprospered.\r\n\r\n14:8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of\r\nJudah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields\r\nand drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were\r\nmighty men of valour.\r\n\r\n14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host\r\nof a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto\r\nMareshah.\r\n\r\n14:10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array\r\nin the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.\r\n\r\n14:11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is\r\nnothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have\r\nno power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy\r\nname we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no\r\nman prevail against thee.\r\n\r\n14:12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;\r\nand the Ethiopians fled.\r\n\r\n14:13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto\r\nGerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover\r\nthemselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his\r\nhost; and they carried away very much spoil.\r\n\r\n14:14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of\r\nthe LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there\r\nwas exceeding much spoil in them.\r\n\r\n14:15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and\r\ncamels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n15:1 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2 And\r\nhe went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all\r\nJudah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if\r\nye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will\r\nforsake you.\r\n\r\n15:3 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and\r\nwithout a teaching priest, and without law.\r\n\r\n15:4 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of\r\nIsrael, and sought him, he was found of them.\r\n\r\n15:5 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor\r\nto him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants\r\nof the countries.\r\n\r\n15:6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did\r\nvex them with all adversity.\r\n\r\n15:7 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your\r\nwork shall be rewarded.\r\n\r\n15:8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the\r\nprophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all\r\nthe land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had\r\ntaken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was\r\nbefore the porch of the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with\r\nthem out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to\r\nhim out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God\r\nwas with him.\r\n\r\n15:10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third\r\nmonth, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.\r\n\r\n15:11 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which\r\nthey had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.\r\n\r\n15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their\r\nfathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 15:13 That\r\nwhosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to\r\ndeath, whether small or great, whether man or woman.\r\n\r\n15:14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with\r\nshouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.\r\n\r\n15:15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all\r\ntheir heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found\r\nof them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.\r\n\r\n15:16 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he\r\nremoved her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove:\r\nand Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook\r\nKidron.\r\n\r\n15:17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:\r\nnevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.\r\n\r\n15:18 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father\r\nhad dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold,\r\nand vessels.\r\n\r\n15:19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of\r\nthe reign of Asa.\r\n\r\n16:1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of\r\nIsrael came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he\r\nmight let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.\r\n\r\n16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the\r\nhouse of the LORD and of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and sent to Benhadad king\r\nof Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 16:3 There is a league\r\nbetween me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father:\r\nbehold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with\r\nBaasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\r\n\r\n16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of\r\nhis armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan,\r\nand Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.\r\n\r\n16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off\r\nbuilding of Ramah, and let his work cease.\r\n\r\n16:6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the\r\nstones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was\r\nbuilding; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.\r\n\r\n16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and\r\nsaid unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not\r\nrelied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria\r\nescaped out of thine hand.\r\n\r\n16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very\r\nmany chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD,\r\nhe delivered them into thine hand.\r\n\r\n16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole\r\nearth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is\r\nperfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from\r\nhenceforth thou shalt have wars.\r\n\r\n16:10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;\r\nfor he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed\r\nsome of the people the same time.\r\n\r\n16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are\r\nwritten in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\r\n\r\n16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased\r\nin his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease\r\nhe sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.\r\n\r\n16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth\r\nyear of his reign.\r\n\r\n16:14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for\r\nhimself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled\r\nwith sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the\r\napothecaries\xe2\x80\x99 art: and they made a very great burning for him.\r\n\r\n17:1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened\r\nhimself against Israel.\r\n\r\n17:2 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set\r\ngarrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which\r\nAsa his father had taken.\r\n\r\n17:3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first\r\nways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; 17:4 But sought\r\nto the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not\r\nafter the doings of Israel.\r\n\r\n17:5 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all\r\nJudah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n17:6 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he\r\ntook away the high places and groves out of Judah.\r\n\r\n17:7 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even\r\nto Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to\r\nMichaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.\r\n\r\n17:8 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and\r\nZebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah,\r\nand Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and\r\nJehoram, priests.\r\n\r\n17:9 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD\r\nwith them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and\r\ntaught the people.\r\n\r\n17:10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands\r\nthat were round about Judah, so that they made no war against\r\nJehoshaphat.\r\n\r\n17:11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and\r\ntribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand\r\nand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.\r\n\r\n17:12 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah\r\ncastles, and cities of store.\r\n\r\n17:13 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of\r\nwar, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n17:14 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of\r\ntheir fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief,\r\nand with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n17:15 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two\r\nhundred and fourscore thousand.\r\n\r\n17:16 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly\r\noffered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand\r\nmighty men of valour.\r\n\r\n17:17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him\r\narmed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n17:18 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and\r\nfourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.\r\n\r\n17:19 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the\r\nfenced cities throughout all Judah.\r\n\r\n18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined\r\naffinity with Ahab.\r\n\r\n18:2 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab\r\nkilled sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he\r\nhad with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.\r\n\r\n18:3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt\r\nthou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou\r\nart, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.\r\n\r\n18:4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray\r\nthee, at the word of the LORD to day.\r\n\r\n18:5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four\r\nhundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to\r\nbattle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver\r\nit into the king\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD\r\nbesides, that we might enquire of him?  18:7 And the king of Israel\r\nsaid unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of\r\nthe LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but\r\nalways evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat\r\nsaid, Let not the king say so.\r\n\r\n18:8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,\r\nFetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.\r\n\r\n18:9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either\r\nof them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void\r\nplace at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets\r\nprophesied before them.\r\n\r\n18:10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,\r\nand said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until\r\nthey be consumed.\r\n\r\n18:11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to\r\nRamothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\n18:12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,\r\nsaying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king\r\nwith one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of\r\ntheirs, and speak thou good.\r\n\r\n18:13 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,\r\nthat will I speak.\r\n\r\n18:14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,\r\nMicaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?\r\nAnd he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into\r\nyour hand.\r\n\r\n18:15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee\r\nthat thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?\r\n18:16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,\r\nas sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no\r\nmaster; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.\r\n\r\n18:17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee\r\nthat he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?  18:18 Again he\r\nsaid, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon\r\nhis throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and\r\non his left.\r\n\r\n18:19 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he\r\nmay go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this\r\nmanner, and another saying after that manner.\r\n\r\n18:20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and\r\nsaid, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?  18:21\r\nAnd he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all\r\nhis prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt\r\nalso prevail: go out, and do even so.\r\n\r\n18:22 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the\r\nmouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n18:23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah\r\nupon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from\r\nme to speak unto thee?  18:24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see\r\non that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.\r\n\r\n18:25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him\r\nback to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king\xe2\x80\x99s son;\r\n18:26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and\r\nfeed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until\r\nI return in peace.\r\n\r\n18:27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath\r\nnot the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.\r\n\r\n18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up\r\nto Ramothgilead.\r\n\r\n18:29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise\r\nmyself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the\r\nking of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.\r\n\r\n18:30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots\r\nthat were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save\r\nonly with the king of Israel.\r\n\r\n18:31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw\r\nJehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they\r\ncompassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD\r\nhelped him; and God moved them to depart from him.\r\n\r\n18:32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots\r\nperceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again\r\nfrom pursuing him.\r\n\r\n18:33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of\r\nIsrael between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his\r\nchariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the\r\nhost; for I am wounded.\r\n\r\n18:34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel\r\nstayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even:\r\nand about the time of the sun going down he died.\r\n\r\n19:1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace\r\nto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and\r\nsaid to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love\r\nthem that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n19:3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou\r\nhast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine\r\nheart to seek God.\r\n\r\n19:4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through\r\nthe people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto\r\nthe LORD God of their fathers.\r\n\r\n19:5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of\r\nJudah, city by city, 19:6 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye\r\ndo: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n19:7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and\r\ndo it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of\r\npersons, nor taking of gifts.\r\n\r\n19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of\r\nthe priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the\r\njudgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n19:9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the\r\nLORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.\r\n\r\n19:10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that\r\ndwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and\r\ncommandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they\r\ntrespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon\r\nyour brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.\r\n\r\n19:11 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters\r\nof the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house\r\nof Judah, for all the king\xe2\x80\x99s matters: also the Levites shall be\r\nofficers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n20:1 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and\r\nthe children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came\r\nagainst Jehoshaphat to battle.\r\n\r\n20:2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh\r\na great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria;\r\nand, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.\r\n\r\n20:3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and\r\nproclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.\r\n\r\n20:4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD:\r\neven out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:5 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,\r\nin the house of the LORD, before the new court, 20:6 And said, O LORD\r\nGod of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou\r\nover all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not\r\npower and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?  20:7 Art not\r\nthou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before\r\nthy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for\r\never?  20:8 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary\r\ntherein for thy name, saying, 20:9 If, when evil cometh upon us, as\r\nthe sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this\r\nhouse, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry\r\nunto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.\r\n\r\n20:10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,\r\nwhom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the\r\nland of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;\r\n20:11 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy\r\npossession, which thou hast given us to inherit.\r\n\r\n20:12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might\r\nagainst this great company that cometh against us; neither know we\r\nwhat to do: but our eyes are upon thee.\r\n\r\n20:13 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,\r\ntheir wives, and their children.\r\n\r\n20:14 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the\r\nson of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph,\r\ncame the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 20:15\r\nAnd he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,\r\nand thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid\r\nnor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not\r\nyours, but God\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n20:16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the\r\ncliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before\r\nthe wilderness of Jeruel.\r\n\r\n20:17 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand\r\nye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and\r\nJerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them:\r\nfor the LORD will be with you.\r\n\r\n20:18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and\r\nall Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD,\r\nworshipping the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:19 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the\r\nchildren of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel\r\nwith a loud voice on high.\r\n\r\n20:20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the\r\nwilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and\r\nsaid, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in\r\nthe LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets,\r\nso shall ye prosper.\r\n\r\n20:21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers\r\nunto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they\r\nwent out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy\r\nendureth for ever.\r\n\r\n20:22 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set\r\nambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which\r\nwere come against Judah; and they were smitten.\r\n\r\n20:23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the\r\ninhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when\r\nthey had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to\r\ndestroy another.\r\n\r\n20:24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,\r\nthey looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies\r\nfallen to the earth, and none escaped.\r\n\r\n20:25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil\r\nof them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead\r\nbodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves,\r\nmore than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering\r\nof the spoil, it was so much.\r\n\r\n20:26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of\r\nBerachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the\r\nsame place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.\r\n\r\n20:27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and\r\nJehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with\r\njoy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.\r\n\r\n20:28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and\r\ntrumpets unto the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries,\r\nwhen they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n20:30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest\r\nround about.\r\n\r\n20:31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years\r\nold when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nAnd his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\r\n\r\n20:32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not\r\nfrom it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the\r\npeople had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.\r\n\r\n20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,\r\nthey are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is\r\nmentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.\r\n\r\n20:35 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with\r\nAhaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 20:36 And he joined\r\nhimself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the\r\nships in Eziongaber.\r\n\r\n20:37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against\r\nJehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,\r\nthe LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they\r\nwere not able to go to Tarshish.\r\n\r\n21:1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his\r\nfathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his\r\nstead.\r\n\r\n21:2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,\r\nand Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these\r\nwere the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.\r\n\r\n21:3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,\r\nand of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom\r\ngave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.\r\n\r\n21:4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he\r\nstrengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and\r\ndivers also of the princes of Israel.\r\n\r\n21:5 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and\r\nhe reigned eight years in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the\r\nhouse of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought\r\nthat which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.\r\n\r\n21:7 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of\r\nthe covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a\r\nlight to him and to his sons for ever.\r\n\r\n21:8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of\r\nJudah, and made themselves a king.\r\n\r\n21:9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots\r\nwith him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which\r\ncompassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.\r\n\r\n21:10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he\r\nhad forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.\r\n\r\n21:11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and\r\ncaused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and\r\ncompelled Judah thereto.\r\n\r\n21:12 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,\r\nThus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not\r\nwalked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa\r\nking of Judah, 21:13 But hast walked in the way of the kings of\r\nIsrael, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a\r\nwhoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast\r\nslain thy brethren of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house, which were better than\r\nthyself: 21:14 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy\r\npeople, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: 21:15 And\r\nthou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy\r\nbowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.\r\n\r\n21:16 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the\r\nPhilistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 21:17\r\nAnd they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all\r\nthe substance that was found in the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and his sons also,\r\nand his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz,\r\nthe youngest of his sons.\r\n\r\n21:18 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an\r\nincurable disease.\r\n\r\n21:19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of\r\ntwo years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died\r\nof sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the\r\nburning of his fathers.\r\n\r\n21:20 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.\r\nHowbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the\r\nsepulchres of the kings.\r\n\r\n22:1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son\r\nking in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to\r\nthe camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king\r\nof Judah reigned.\r\n\r\n22:2 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and\r\nhe reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s name also was Athaliah\r\nthe daughter of Omri.\r\n\r\n22:3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother\r\nwas his counsellor to do wickedly.\r\n\r\n22:4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of\r\nAhab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to\r\nhis destruction.\r\n\r\n22:5 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son\r\nof Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at\r\nRamothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.\r\n\r\n22:6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds\r\nwhich were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of\r\nSyria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see\r\nJehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.\r\n\r\n22:7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for\r\nwhen he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of\r\nNimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.\r\n\r\n22:8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon\r\nthe house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the\r\nbrethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.\r\n\r\n22:9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in\r\nSamaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they\r\nburied him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who\r\nsought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no\r\npower to keep still the kingdom.\r\n\r\n22:10 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was\r\ndead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n22:11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son\r\nof Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king\xe2\x80\x99s sons that were slain,\r\nand put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the\r\ndaughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she\r\nwas the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew\r\nhim not.\r\n\r\n22:12 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and\r\nAthaliah reigned over the land.\r\n\r\n23:1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took\r\nthe captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the\r\nson of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of\r\nAdaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.\r\n\r\n23:2 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all\r\nthe cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they\r\ncame to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n23:3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the\r\nhouse of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king\xe2\x80\x99s son shall\r\nreign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.\r\n\r\n23:4 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering\r\non the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of\r\nthe doors; 23:5 And a third part shall be at the king\xe2\x80\x99s house; and a\r\nthird part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be\r\nin the courts of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:6 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests,\r\nand they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are\r\nholy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man\r\nwith his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the\r\nhouse, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he\r\ncometh in, and when he goeth out.\r\n\r\n23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that\r\nJehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that\r\nwere to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the\r\nsabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.\r\n\r\n23:9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of\r\nhundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king\r\nDavid\xe2\x80\x99s, which were in the house of God.\r\n\r\n23:10 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his\r\nhand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the\r\ntemple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.\r\n\r\n23:11 Then they brought out the king\xe2\x80\x99s son, and put upon him the\r\ncrown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and\r\nhis sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.\r\n\r\n23:12 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and\r\npraising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:\r\n23:13 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the\r\nentering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the\r\npeople of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the\r\nsingers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.\r\nThen Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.\r\n\r\n23:14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds\r\nthat were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the\r\nranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For\r\nthe priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:15 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering\r\nof the horse gate by the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, they slew her there.\r\n\r\n23:16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the\r\npeople, and between the king, that they should be the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s people.\r\n\r\n23:17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it\r\ndown, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan\r\nthe priest of Baal before the altars.\r\n\r\n23:18 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by\r\nthe hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the\r\nhouse of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is\r\nwritten in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it\r\nwas ordained by David.\r\n\r\n23:19 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,\r\nthat none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.\r\n\r\n23:20 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the\r\ngovernors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought\r\ndown the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the\r\nhigh gate into the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and set the king upon the throne of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\n23:21 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,\r\nafter that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.\r\n\r\n24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\nforty years in Jerusalem. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s name also was Zibiah of\r\nBeersheba.\r\n\r\n24:2 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all\r\nthe days of Jehoiada the priest.\r\n\r\n24:3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n24:4 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair\r\nthe house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:5 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to\r\nthem, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money\r\nto repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye\r\nhasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.\r\n\r\n24:6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,\r\nWhy hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and\r\nout of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses\r\nthe servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the\r\ntabernacle of witness?  24:7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked\r\nwoman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated\r\nthings of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.\r\n\r\n24:8 And at the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment they made a chest, and set it\r\nwithout at the gate of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to\r\nbring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid\r\nupon Israel in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n24:10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,\r\nand cast into the chest, until they had made an end.\r\n\r\n24:11 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought\r\nunto the king\xe2\x80\x99s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw\r\nthat there was much money, the king\xe2\x80\x99s scribe and the high priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nofficer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his\r\nplace again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n24:12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the\r\nservice of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to\r\nrepair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass\r\nto mend the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:13 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and\r\nthey set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.\r\n\r\n24:14 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the\r\nmoney before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the\r\nhouse of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and\r\nspoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt\r\nofferings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of\r\nJehoiada.\r\n\r\n24:15 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an\r\nhundred and thirty years old was he when he died.\r\n\r\n24:16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,\r\nbecause he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and\r\nmade obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.\r\n\r\n24:18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and\r\nserved groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for\r\nthis their trespass.\r\n\r\n24:19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;\r\nand they testified against them: but they would not give ear.\r\n\r\n24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada\r\nthe priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus\r\nsaith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye\r\ncannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also\r\nforsaken you.\r\n\r\n24:21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at\r\nthe commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n24:22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada\r\nhis father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he\r\nsaid, The LORD look upon it, and require it.\r\n\r\n24:23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of\r\nSyria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and\r\ndestroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and\r\nsent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.\r\n\r\n24:24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,\r\nand the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they\r\nhad forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment\r\nagainst Joash.\r\n\r\n24:25 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in\r\ngreat diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood\r\nof the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he\r\ndied: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him\r\nnot in the sepulchres of the kings.\r\n\r\n24:26 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of\r\nShimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.\r\n\r\n24:27 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid\r\nupon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are\r\nwritten in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n25:1 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and\r\nhe reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nwas Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n25:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not\r\nwith a perfect heart.\r\n\r\n25:3 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,\r\nthat he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.\r\n\r\n25:4 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the\r\nlaw in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The\r\nfathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die\r\nfor the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.\r\n\r\n25:5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains\r\nover thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of\r\ntheir fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them\r\nfrom twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand\r\nchoice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n25:6 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of\r\nIsrael for an hundred talents of silver.\r\n\r\n25:7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the\r\narmy of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit,\r\nwith all the children of Ephraim.\r\n\r\n25:8 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall\r\nmake thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to\r\ncast down.\r\n\r\n25:9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the\r\nhundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man\r\nof God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.\r\n\r\n25:10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to\r\nhim out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was\r\ngreatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.\r\n\r\n25:11 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and\r\nwent to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n25:12 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah\r\ncarry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and\r\ncast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n25:13 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they\r\nshould not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from\r\nSamaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and\r\ntook much spoil.\r\n\r\n25:14 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the\r\nslaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of\r\nSeir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before\r\nthem, and burned incense unto them.\r\n\r\n25:15 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and\r\nhe sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought\r\nafter the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people\r\nout of thine hand?  25:16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him,\r\nthat the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king\xe2\x80\x99s counsel?\r\nforbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and\r\nsaid, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou\r\nhast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.\r\n\r\n25:17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the\r\nson of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us\r\nsee one another in the face.\r\n\r\n25:18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,\r\nThe thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,\r\nsaying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a\r\nwild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.\r\n\r\n25:19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart\r\nlifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle\r\nto thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with\r\nthee?  25:20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he\r\nmight deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought\r\nafter the gods of Edom.\r\n\r\n25:21 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in\r\nthe face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which\r\nbelongeth to Judah.\r\n\r\n25:22 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled\r\nevery man to his tent.\r\n\r\n25:23 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son\r\nof Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to\r\nJerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of\r\nEphraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n25:24 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels\r\nthat were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures\r\nof the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.\r\n\r\n25:25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death\r\nof Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.\r\n\r\n25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are\r\nthey not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?  25:27\r\nNow after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD\r\nthey made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to\r\nLachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.\r\n\r\n25:28 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his\r\nfathers in the city of Judah.\r\n\r\n26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years\r\nold, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.\r\n\r\n26:2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king\r\nslept with his fathers.\r\n\r\n26:3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s name also was\r\nJecoliah of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n26:4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that his father Amaziah did.\r\n\r\n26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding\r\nin the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him\r\nto prosper.\r\n\r\n26:6 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake\r\ndown the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,\r\nand built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.\r\n\r\n26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the\r\nArabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.\r\n\r\n26:8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread\r\nabroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and\r\nat the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n26:10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for\r\nhe had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains:\r\nhusbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel:\r\nfor he loved husbandry.\r\n\r\n26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to\r\nwar by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of\r\nJeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah,\r\none of the king\xe2\x80\x99s captains.\r\n\r\n26:12 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men\r\nof valour were two thousand and six hundred.\r\n\r\n26:13 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and\r\nseven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to\r\nhelp the king against the enemy.\r\n\r\n26:14 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,\r\nand spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n26:15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be\r\non the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones\r\nwithal.\r\n\r\nAnd his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till\r\nhe was strong.\r\n\r\n26:16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his\r\ndestruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went\r\ninto the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.\r\n\r\n26:17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore\r\npriests of the LORD, that were valiant men: 26:18 And they withstood\r\nUzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee,\r\nUzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of\r\nAaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary;\r\nfor thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from\r\nthe LORD God.\r\n\r\n26:19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn\r\nincense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even\r\nrose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD,\r\nfrom beside the incense altar.\r\n\r\n26:20 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon\r\nhim, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him\r\nout from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD\r\nhad smitten him.\r\n\r\n26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and\r\ndwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the\r\nhouse of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\njudging the people of the land.\r\n\r\n26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah\r\nthe prophet, the son of Amoz, write.\r\n\r\n26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his\r\nfathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for\r\nthey said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n27:1 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and\r\nhe reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s name also was\r\nJerushah, the daughter of Zadok.\r\n\r\n27:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not\r\ninto the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.\r\n\r\n27:3 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall\r\nof Ophel he built much.\r\n\r\n27:4 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the\r\nforests he built castles and towers.\r\n\r\n27:5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed\r\nagainst them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an\r\nhundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten\r\nthousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him,\r\nboth the second year, and the third.\r\n\r\n27:6 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the\r\nLORD his God.\r\n\r\n27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his\r\nways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n27:8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and\r\nreigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n27:9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the\r\ncity of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n28:1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\nsixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the\r\nsight of the LORD, like David his father: 28:2 For he walked in the\r\nways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.\r\n\r\n28:3 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and\r\nburnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen\r\nwhom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n28:4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on\r\nthe hills, and under every green tree.\r\n\r\n28:5 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the\r\nking of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude\r\nof them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also\r\ndelivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a\r\ngreat slaughter.\r\n\r\n28:6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty\r\nthousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had\r\nforsaken the LORD God of their fathers.\r\n\r\n28:7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next\r\nto the king.\r\n\r\n28:8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren\r\ntwo hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away\r\nmuch spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.\r\n\r\n28:9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he\r\nwent out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them,\r\nBehold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he\r\nhath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage\r\nthat reacheth up unto heaven.\r\n\r\n28:10 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and\r\nJerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with\r\nyou, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?  28:11 Now hear me\r\ntherefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive\r\nof your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.\r\n\r\n28:12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah\r\nthe son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah\r\nthe son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them\r\nthat came from the war, 28:13 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring\r\nin the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD\r\nalready, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for\r\nour trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.\r\n\r\n28:14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the\r\nprinces and all the congregation.\r\n\r\n28:15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the\r\ncaptives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them,\r\nand arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink,\r\nand anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and\r\nbrought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren:\r\nthen they returned to Samaria.\r\n\r\n28:16 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\n28:17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried\r\naway captives.\r\n\r\n28:18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country,\r\nand of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and\r\nGederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the\r\nvillages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n28:19 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;\r\nfor he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.\r\n\r\n28:20 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and\r\ndistressed him, but strengthened him not.\r\n\r\n28:21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and\r\nout of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the\r\nking of Assyria: but he helped him not.\r\n\r\n28:22 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against\r\nthe LORD: this is that king Ahaz.\r\n\r\n28:23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:\r\nand he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,\r\ntherefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they\r\nwere the ruin of him, and of all Israel.\r\n\r\n28:24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and\r\ncut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors\r\nof the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n28:25 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn\r\nincense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n28:26 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,\r\nbehold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\r\n\r\n28:27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the\r\ncity, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres\r\nof the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n29:1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,\r\nand he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.\r\n\r\n29:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,\r\naccording to all that David his father had done.\r\n\r\n29:3 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the\r\ndoors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.\r\n\r\n29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them\r\ntogether into the east street, 29:5 And said unto them, Hear me, ye\r\nLevites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD\r\nGod of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n29:6 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in\r\nthe eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned\r\naway their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\n29:7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the\r\nlamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the\r\nholy place unto the God of Israel.\r\n\r\n29:8 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and\r\nhe hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as\r\nye see with your eyes.\r\n\r\n29:9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and\r\nour daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.\r\n\r\n29:10 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of\r\nIsrael, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.\r\n\r\n29:11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to\r\nstand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him,\r\nand burn incense.\r\n\r\n29:12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the\r\nson of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of\r\nMerari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of\r\nthe Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:\r\n29:13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons\r\nof Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 29:14 And of the sons of Heman;\r\nJehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.\r\n\r\n29:15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and\r\ncame, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the\r\nLORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the\r\nLORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they\r\nfound in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the\r\nLORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook\r\nKidron.\r\n\r\n29:17 Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify,\r\nand on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD:\r\nso they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the\r\nsixteenth day of the first month they made an end.\r\n\r\n29:18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have\r\ncleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering,\r\nwith all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the\r\nvessels thereof.\r\n\r\n29:19 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast\r\naway in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and,\r\nbehold, they are before the altar of the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:20 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of\r\nthe city, and went up to the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven\r\nlambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for\r\nthe sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of\r\nAaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:22 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood,\r\nand sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the\r\nrams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the\r\nlambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.\r\n\r\n29:23 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before\r\nthe king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:\r\n29:24 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with\r\ntheir blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for\r\nthe king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should\r\nbe made for all Israel.\r\n\r\n29:25 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,\r\nwith psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of\r\nDavid, and of Gad the king\xe2\x80\x99s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was\r\nthe commandment of the LORD by his prophets.\r\n\r\n29:26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the\r\npriests with the trumpets.\r\n\r\n29:27 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nAnd when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also\r\nwith the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n29:28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and\r\nthe trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt\r\noffering was finished.\r\n\r\n29:29 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that\r\nwere present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.\r\n\r\n29:30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites\r\nto sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the\r\nseer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads\r\nand worshipped.\r\n\r\n29:31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated\r\nyourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank\r\nofferings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in\r\nsacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart\r\nburnt offerings.\r\n\r\n29:32 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation\r\nbrought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two\r\nhundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:33 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three\r\nthousand sheep.\r\n\r\n29:34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all\r\nthe burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help\r\nthem, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had\r\nsanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to\r\nsanctify themselves than the priests.\r\n\r\n29:35 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of\r\nthe peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering.\r\nSo the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.\r\n\r\n29:36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared\r\nthe people: for the thing was done suddenly.\r\n\r\n30:1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also\r\nto Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the\r\nLORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n30:2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the\r\ncongregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.\r\n\r\n30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had\r\nnot sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people\r\ngathered themselves together to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n30:4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.\r\n\r\n30:5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all\r\nIsrael, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the\r\npassover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not\r\ndone it of a long time in such sort as it was written.\r\n\r\n30:6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes\r\nthroughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of\r\nthe king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God\r\nof Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of\r\nyou, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.\r\n\r\n30:7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which\r\ntrespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave\r\nthem up to desolation, as ye see.\r\n\r\n30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield\r\nyourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath\r\nsanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness\r\nof his wrath may turn away from you.\r\n\r\n30:9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your\r\nchildren shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so\r\nthat they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is\r\ngracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye\r\nreturn unto him.\r\n\r\n30:10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of\r\nEphraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to\r\nscorn, and mocked them.\r\n\r\n30:11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled\r\nthemselves, and came to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n30:12 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do\r\nthe commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n30:13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast\r\nof unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.\r\n\r\n30:14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,\r\nand all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the\r\nbrook Kidron.\r\n\r\n30:15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the\r\nsecond month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and\r\nsanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the\r\nhouse of the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to\r\nthe law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood,\r\nwhich they received of the hand of the Levites.\r\n\r\n30:17 For there were many in the congregation that were not\r\nsanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the\r\npassovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n30:18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and\r\nManasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did\r\nthey eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah\r\nprayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one 30:19 That\r\nprepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though\r\nhe be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n30:20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.\r\n\r\n30:21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept\r\nthe feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the\r\nLevites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud\r\ninstruments unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught\r\nthe good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast\r\nseven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the\r\nLORD God of their fathers.\r\n\r\n30:23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:\r\nand they kept other seven days with gladness.\r\n\r\n30:24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a\r\nthousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to\r\nthe congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a\r\ngreat number of priests sanctified themselves.\r\n\r\n30:25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the\r\nLevites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the\r\nstrangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in\r\nJudah, rejoiced.\r\n\r\n30:26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of\r\nSolomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n30:27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and\r\ntheir voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling\r\nplace, even unto heaven.\r\n\r\n31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went\r\nout to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut\r\ndown the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of\r\nall Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had\r\nutterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned,\r\nevery man to his possession, into their own cities.\r\n\r\n31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites\r\nafter their courses, every man according to his service, the priests\r\nand Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister,\r\nand to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n31:3 He appointed also the king\xe2\x80\x99s portion of his substance for the\r\nburnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings,\r\nand the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and\r\nfor the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give\r\nthe portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be\r\nencouraged in the law of the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of\r\nIsrael brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil,\r\nand honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all\r\nthings brought they in abundantly.\r\n\r\n31:6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in\r\nthe cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep,\r\nand the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD\r\ntheir God, and laid them by heaps.\r\n\r\n31:7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,\r\nand finished them in the seventh month.\r\n\r\n31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they\r\nblessed the LORD, and his people Israel.\r\n\r\n31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites\r\nconcerning the heaps.\r\n\r\n31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him,\r\nand said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house\r\nof the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the\r\nLORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the\r\nLORD; and they prepared them, 31:12 And brought in the offerings and\r\nthe tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah\r\nthe Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.\r\n\r\n31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,\r\nand Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were\r\noverseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the\r\ncommandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the\r\neast, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the\r\noblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.\r\n\r\n31:15 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,\r\nAmariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set\r\noffice, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as\r\nto the small: 31:16 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years\r\nold and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of\r\nthe LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges\r\naccording to their courses; 31:17 Both to the genealogy of the priests\r\nby the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old\r\nand upward, in their charges by their courses; 31:18 And to the\r\ngenealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and\r\ntheir daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office\r\nthey sanctified themselves in holiness: 31:19 Also of the sons of\r\nAaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their\r\ncities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to\r\ngive portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were\r\nreckoned by genealogies among the Levites.\r\n\r\n31:20 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that\r\nwhich was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.\r\n\r\n31:21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of\r\nGod, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did\r\nit with all his heart, and prospered.\r\n\r\n32:1 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib\r\nking of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the\r\nfenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.\r\n\r\n32:2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was\r\npurposed to fight against Jerusalem, 32:3 He took counsel with his\r\nprinces and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which\r\nwere without the city: and they did help him.\r\n\r\n32:4 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the\r\nfountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land,\r\nsaying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?\r\n32:5 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was\r\nbroken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and\r\nrepaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n32:6 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them\r\ntogether to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake\r\ncomfortably to them, saying, 32:7 Be strong and courageous, be not\r\nafraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude\r\nthat is with him: for there be more with us than with him: 32:8 With\r\nhim is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us,\r\nand to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the\r\nwords of Hezekiah king of Judah.\r\n\r\n32:9 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to\r\nJerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his\r\npower with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that\r\nwere at Jerusalem, saying, 32:10 Thus saith Sennacherib king of\r\nAssyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?\r\n32:11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by\r\nfamine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of\r\nthe hand of the king of Assyria?  32:12 Hath not the same Hezekiah\r\ntaken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and\r\nJerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense\r\nupon it?  32:13 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all\r\nthe people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands\r\nany ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?  32:14 Who was\r\nthere among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly\r\ndestroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your\r\nGod should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?  32:15 Now\r\ntherefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this\r\nmanner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom\r\nwas able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand\r\nof my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine\r\nhand?  32:16 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and\r\nagainst his servant Hezekiah.\r\n\r\n32:17 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to\r\nspeak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands\r\nhave not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God\r\nof Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.\r\n\r\n32:18 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 speech unto the\r\npeople of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to\r\ntrouble them; that they might take the city.\r\n\r\n32:19 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods\r\nof the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.\r\n\r\n32:20 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the\r\nson of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.\r\n\r\n32:21 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of\r\nvalour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of\r\nAssyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when\r\nhe was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own\r\nbowels slew him there with the sword.\r\n\r\n32:22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem\r\nfrom the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of\r\nall other, and guided them on every side.\r\n\r\n32:23 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents\r\nto Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of\r\nall nations from thenceforth.\r\n\r\n32:24 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto\r\nthe LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.\r\n\r\n32:25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done\r\nunto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon\r\nhim, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n32:26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his\r\nheart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of\r\nthe LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.\r\n\r\n32:27 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made\r\nhimself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones,\r\nand for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant\r\njewels; 32:28 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and\r\noil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.\r\n\r\n32:29 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and\r\nherds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.\r\n\r\n32:30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,\r\nand brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David.\r\nAnd Hezekiah prospered in all his works.\r\n\r\n32:31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of\r\nBabylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in\r\nthe land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold,\r\nthey are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,\r\nand in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.\r\n\r\n32:33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the\r\nchiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his\r\nson reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 33:2 But did that which was\r\nevil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the\r\nheathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n33:3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had\r\nbroken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and\r\nworshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.\r\n\r\n33:4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD\r\nhad said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.\r\n\r\n33:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts\r\nof the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n33:6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley\r\nof the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments,\r\nand used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with\r\nwizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him\r\nto anger.\r\n\r\n33:7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the\r\nhouse of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son,\r\nIn this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the\r\ntribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 33:8 Neither will I any\r\nmore remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have\r\nappointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that\r\nI have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and\r\nthe ordinances by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n33:9 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,\r\nand to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before\r\nthe children of Israel.\r\n\r\n33:10 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they\r\nwould not hearken.\r\n\r\n33:11 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of\r\nthe king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound\r\nhim with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.\r\n\r\n33:12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and\r\nhumbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, 33:13 And\r\nprayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his\r\nsupplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.\r\nThen Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.\r\n\r\n33:14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the\r\nwest side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish\r\ngate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height,\r\nand put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.\r\n\r\n33:15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house\r\nof the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the\r\nhouse of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.\r\n\r\n33:16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon\r\npeace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the\r\nLORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n33:17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,\r\nyet unto the LORD their God only.\r\n\r\n33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his\r\nGod, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the\r\nLORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n33:19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his\r\nsins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places,\r\nand set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold,\r\nthey are written among the sayings of the seers.\r\n\r\n33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his\r\nown house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n33:21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and\r\nreigned two years in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n33:22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did\r\nManasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images\r\nwhich Manasseh his father had made, and served them; 33:23 And humbled\r\nnot himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled\r\nhimself; but Amon trespassed more and more.\r\n\r\n33:24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n33:25 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired\r\nagainst king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned\r\nin Jerusalem one and thirty years.\r\n\r\n34:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and\r\nwalked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the\r\nright hand, nor to the left.\r\n\r\n34:3 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he\r\nbegan to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth\r\nyear he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and\r\nthe groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.\r\n\r\n34:4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the\r\nimages, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and\r\nthe carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made\r\ndust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had\r\nsacrificed unto them.\r\n\r\n34:5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and\r\ncleansed Judah and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n34:6 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,\r\neven unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.\r\n\r\n34:7 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had\r\nbeaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols\r\nthroughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n34:8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the\r\nland, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah\r\nthe governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to\r\nrepair the house of the LORD his God.\r\n\r\n34:9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the\r\nmoney that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that\r\nkept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and\r\nof all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they\r\nreturned to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n34:10 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the\r\noversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen\r\nthat wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:\r\n34:11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn\r\nstone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the\r\nkings of Judah had destroyed.\r\n\r\n34:12 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them\r\nwere Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and\r\nZechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it\r\nforward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments\r\nof musick.\r\n\r\n34:13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers\r\nof all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the\r\nLevites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.\r\n\r\n34:14 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the\r\nhouse of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the\r\nLORD given by Moses.\r\n\r\n34:15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have\r\nfound the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah\r\ndelivered the book to Shaphan.\r\n\r\n34:16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king\r\nword back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\n34:17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the\r\nhouse of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the\r\noverseers, and to the hand of the workmen.\r\n\r\n34:18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the\r\npriest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.\r\n\r\n34:19 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the\r\nlaw, that he rent his clothes.\r\n\r\n34:20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,\r\nand Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a\r\nservant of the king\xe2\x80\x99s, saying, 34:21 Go, enquire of the LORD for me,\r\nand for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the\r\nwords of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD\r\nthat is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word\r\nof the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.\r\n\r\n34:22 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to\r\nHuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son\r\nof Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the\r\ncollege:) and they spake to her to that effect.\r\n\r\n34:23 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell\r\nye the man that sent you to me, 34:24 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I\r\nwill bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof,\r\neven all the curses that are written in the book which they have read\r\nbefore the king of Judah: 34:25 Because they have forsaken me, and\r\nhave burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to\r\nanger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be\r\npoured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.\r\n\r\n34:26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the\r\nLORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel\r\nconcerning the words which thou hast heard; 34:27 Because thine heart\r\nwas tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou\r\nheardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants\r\nthereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes,\r\nand weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n34:28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be\r\ngathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the\r\nevil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of\r\nthe same. So they brought the king word again.\r\n\r\n34:29 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah\r\nand Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n34:30 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men\r\nof Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the\r\nLevites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their\r\nears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the\r\nhouse of the LORD.\r\n\r\n34:31 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the\r\nLORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his\r\ntestimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his\r\nsoul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n34:32 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to\r\nstand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the\r\ncovenant of God, the God of their fathers.\r\n\r\n34:33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the\r\ncountries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that\r\nwere present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And\r\nall his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of\r\ntheir fathers.\r\n\r\n35:1 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and\r\nthey killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.\r\n\r\n35:2 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to\r\nthe service of the house of the LORD, 35:3 And said unto the Levites\r\nthat taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy\r\nark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did\r\nbuild; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the\r\nLORD your God, and his people Israel, 35:4 And prepare yourselves by\r\nthe houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the\r\nwriting of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of\r\nSolomon his son.\r\n\r\n35:5 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the\r\nfamilies of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the\r\ndivision of the families of the Levites.\r\n\r\n35:6 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your\r\nbrethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the\r\nhand of Moses.\r\n\r\n35:7 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all\r\nfor the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number\r\nof thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s substance.\r\n\r\n35:8 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests,\r\nand to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the\r\nhouse of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two\r\nthousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.\r\n\r\n35:9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and\r\nHashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the\r\nLevites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five\r\nhundred oxen.\r\n\r\n35:10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their\r\nplace, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommandment.\r\n\r\n35:11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the\r\nblood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.\r\n\r\n35:12 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give\r\naccording to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer\r\nunto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they\r\nwith the oxen.\r\n\r\n35:13 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the\r\nordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in\r\ncaldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.\r\n\r\n35:14 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the\r\npriests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering\r\nof burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites\r\nprepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.\r\n\r\n35:15 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according\r\nto the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not\r\ndepart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n35:16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to\r\nkeep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the\r\nLORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.\r\n\r\n35:17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover\r\nat that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.\r\n\r\n35:18 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the\r\ndays of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep\r\nsuch a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and\r\nall Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n35:19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover\r\nkept.\r\n\r\n35:20 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king\r\nof Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah\r\nwent out against him.\r\n\r\n35:21 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with\r\nthee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but\r\nagainst the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make\r\nhaste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he\r\ndestroy thee not.\r\n\r\n35:22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but\r\ndisguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not\r\nunto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in\r\nthe valley of Megiddo.\r\n\r\n35:23 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his\r\nservants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.\r\n\r\n35:24 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him\r\nin the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem,\r\nand he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers.\r\nAnd all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.\r\n\r\n35:25 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and\r\nthe singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day,\r\nand made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in\r\nthe lamentations.\r\n\r\n35:26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according\r\nto that which was written in the law of the LORD, 35:27 And his deeds,\r\nfirst and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of\r\nIsrael and Judah.\r\n\r\n36:1 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and\r\nmade him king in his father\xe2\x80\x99s stead in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n36:2 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign,\r\nand he reigned three months in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n36:3 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned\r\nthe land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.\r\n\r\n36:4 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah\r\nand Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took\r\nJehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.\r\n\r\n36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,\r\nand he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was\r\nevil in the sight of the LORD his God.\r\n\r\n36:6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him\r\nin fetters, to carry him to Babylon.\r\n\r\n36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the\r\nLORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.\r\n\r\n36:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which\r\nhe did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in\r\nthe book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he\r\nreigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which\r\nwas evil in the sight of the LORD.\r\n\r\n36:10 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and\r\nbrought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the\r\nLORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n36:11 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,\r\nand reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n36:12 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God,\r\nand humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the\r\nmouth of the LORD.\r\n\r\n36:13 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made\r\nhim swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart\r\nfrom turning unto the LORD God of Israel.\r\n\r\n36:14 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,\r\ntransgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and\r\npolluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n36:15 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his\r\nmessengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion\r\non his people, and on his dwelling place: 36:16 But they mocked the\r\nmessengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets,\r\nuntil the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was\r\nno remedy.\r\n\r\n36:17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who\r\nslew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary,\r\nand had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that\r\nstooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.\r\n\r\n36:18 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and\r\nthe treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king,\r\nand of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.\r\n\r\n36:19 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of\r\nJerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed\r\nall the goodly vessels thereof.\r\n\r\n36:20 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to\r\nBabylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign\r\nof the kingdom of Persia: 36:21 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the\r\nmouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as\r\nlong as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and\r\nten years.\r\n\r\n36:22 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of\r\nthe LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the\r\nLORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a\r\nproclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing,\r\nsaying, 36:23 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the\r\nearth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to\r\nbuild him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among\r\nyou of all his people?  The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEzra\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of\r\nthe LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred\r\nup the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation\r\nthroughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 1:2\r\nThus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me\r\nall the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an\r\nhouse at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.\r\n\r\n1:3 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and\r\nlet him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of\r\nthe LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the\r\nmen of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods,\r\nand with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God\r\nthat is in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and\r\nthe priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had\r\nraised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:6 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with\r\nvessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with\r\nprecious things, beside all that was willingly offered.\r\n\r\n1:7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the\r\nLORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had\r\nput them in the house of his gods; 1:8 Even those did Cyrus king of\r\nPersia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and\r\nnumbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.\r\n\r\n1:9 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a\r\nthousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, 1:10 Thirty\r\nbasons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten,\r\nand other vessels a thousand.\r\n\r\n1:11 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four\r\nhundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity\r\nthat were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2:1 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the\r\ncaptivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar\r\nthe king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto\r\nJerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; 2:2 Which came with\r\nZerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan,\r\nMizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of\r\nIsrael: 2:3 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy\r\nand two.\r\n\r\n2:4 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.\r\n\r\n2:5 The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy and five.\r\n\r\n2:6 The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab,\r\ntwo thousand eight hundred and twelve.\r\n\r\n2:7 The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.\r\n\r\n2:8 The children of Zattu, nine hundred forty and five.\r\n\r\n2:9 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.\r\n\r\n2:10 The children of Bani, six hundred forty and two.\r\n\r\n2:11 The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and three.\r\n\r\n2:12 The children of Azgad, a thousand two hundred twenty and two.\r\n\r\n2:13 The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty and six.\r\n\r\n2:14 The children of Bigvai, two thousand fifty and six.\r\n\r\n2:15 The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four.\r\n\r\n2:16 The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.\r\n\r\n2:17 The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three.\r\n\r\n2:18 The children of Jorah, an hundred and twelve.\r\n\r\n2:19 The children of Hashum, two hundred twenty and three.\r\n\r\n2:20 The children of Gibbar, ninety and five.\r\n\r\n2:21 The children of Bethlehem, an hundred twenty and three.\r\n\r\n2:22 The men of Netophah, fifty and six.\r\n\r\n2:23 The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight.\r\n\r\n2:24 The children of Azmaveth, forty and two.\r\n\r\n2:25 The children of Kirjatharim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven\r\nhundred and forty and three.\r\n\r\n2:26 The children of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one.\r\n\r\n2:27 The men of Michmas, an hundred twenty and two.\r\n\r\n2:28 The men of Bethel and Ai, two hundred twenty and three.\r\n\r\n2:29 The children of Nebo, fifty and two.\r\n\r\n2:30 The children of Magbish, an hundred fifty and six.\r\n\r\n2:31 The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n2:32 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\n2:33 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n2:34 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.\r\n\r\n2:35 The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\n2:36 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua,\r\nnine hundred seventy and three.\r\n\r\n2:37 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.\r\n\r\n2:38 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.\r\n\r\n2:39 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.\r\n\r\n2:40 The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children\r\nof Hodaviah, seventy and four.\r\n\r\n2:41 The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred twenty and eight.\r\n\r\n2:42 The children of the porters: the children of Shallum, the\r\nchildren of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the\r\nchildren of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all an hundred thirty\r\nand nine.\r\n\r\n2:43 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the\r\nchildren of Tabbaoth, 2:44 The children of Keros, the children of\r\nSiaha, the children of Padon, 2:45 The children of Lebanah, the\r\nchildren of Hagabah, the children of Akkub, 2:46 The children of\r\nHagab, the children of Shalmai, the children of Hanan, 2:47 The\r\nchildren of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah,\r\n2:48 The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of\r\nGazzam, 2:49 The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the\r\nchildren of Besai, 2:50 The children of Asnah, the children of\r\nMehunim, the children of Nephusim, 2:51 The children of Bakbuk, the\r\nchildren of Hakupha, the children of Harhur, 2:52 The children of\r\nBazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha, 2:53 The\r\nchildren of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Thamah,\r\n2:54 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.\r\n\r\n2:55 The children of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s servants: the children of Sotai, the\r\nchildren of Sophereth, the children of Peruda, 2:56 The children of\r\nJaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 2:57 The\r\nchildren of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of\r\nPochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.\r\n\r\n2:58 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s servants, were\r\nthree hundred ninety and two.\r\n\r\n2:59 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,\r\nCherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and their seed, whether they were of Israel: 2:60 The children\r\nof Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six\r\nhundred fifty and two.\r\n\r\n2:61 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the\r\nchildren of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the\r\ndaughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name:\r\n2:62 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by\r\ngenealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted,\r\nput from the priesthood.\r\n\r\n2:63 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the\r\nmost holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with\r\nThummim.\r\n\r\n2:64 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three\r\nhundred and threescore, 2:65 Beside their servants and their maids, of\r\nwhom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and\r\nthere were among them two hundred singing men and singing women.\r\n\r\n2:66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two\r\nhundred forty and five; 2:67 Their camels, four hundred thirty and\r\nfive; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\n2:68 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house\r\nof the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God\r\nto set it up in his place: 2:69 They gave after their ability unto the\r\ntreasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and\r\nfive thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests\xe2\x80\x99 garments.\r\n\r\n2:70 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the\r\nsingers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities,\r\nand all Israel in their cities.\r\n\r\n3:1 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel\r\nwere in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man\r\nto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3:2 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the\r\npriests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and\r\nbuilded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings\r\nthereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.\r\n\r\n3:3 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them\r\nbecause of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt\r\nofferings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n3:4 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and\r\noffered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom,\r\nas the duty of every day required; 3:5 And afterward offered the\r\ncontinual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set\r\nfeasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that\r\nwillingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:6 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt\r\nofferings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD\r\nwas not yet laid.\r\n\r\n3:7 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and\r\nmeat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to\r\nbring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the\r\ngrant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.\r\n\r\n3:8 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at\r\nJerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,\r\nand Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the\r\npriests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the\r\ncaptivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years\r\nold and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:9 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his\r\nsons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the\r\nhouse of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren\r\nthe Levites.\r\n\r\n3:10 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the\r\nLORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the\r\nLevites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the\r\nordinance of David king of Israel.\r\n\r\n3:11 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks\r\nunto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever\r\ntoward Israel.\r\n\r\nAnd all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the\r\nLORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.\r\n\r\n3:12 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who\r\nwere ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation\r\nof this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and\r\nmany shouted aloud for joy: 3:13 So that the people could not discern\r\nthe noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the\r\npeople: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was\r\nheard afar off.\r\n\r\n4:1 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the\r\nchildren of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of\r\nIsrael; 4:2 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the\r\nfathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your\r\nGod, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of\r\nEsarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.\r\n\r\n4:3 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the\r\nfathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to\r\nbuild an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto\r\nthe LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath\r\ncommanded us.\r\n\r\n4:4 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of\r\nJudah, and troubled them in building, 4:5 And hired counsellors\r\nagainst them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king\r\nof Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.\r\n\r\n4:6 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,\r\nwrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,\r\nand the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and\r\nthe writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and\r\ninterpreted in the Syrian tongue.\r\n\r\n4:8 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter\r\nagainst Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 4:9 Then wrote\r\nRehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their\r\ncompanions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the\r\nApharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the\r\nDehavites, and the Elamites, 4:10 And the rest of the nations whom the\r\ngreat and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of\r\nSamaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n4:11 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto\r\nArtaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and\r\nat such a time.\r\n\r\n4:12 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee\r\nto us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad\r\ncity, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.\r\n\r\n4:13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and\r\nthe walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and\r\ncustom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.\r\n\r\n4:14 Now because we have maintenance from the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and it\r\nwas not meet for us to see the king\xe2\x80\x99s dishonour, therefore have we\r\nsent and certified the king; 4:15 That search may be made in the book\r\nof the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the\r\nrecords, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful\r\nunto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the\r\nsame of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.\r\n\r\n4:16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the\r\nwalls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this\r\nside the river.\r\n\r\n4:17 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to\r\nShimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in\r\nSamaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n4:18 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n4:19 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that\r\nthis city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that\r\nrebellion and sedition have been made therein.\r\n\r\n4:20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have\r\nruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and\r\ncustom, was paid unto them.\r\n\r\n4:21 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that\r\nthis city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n4:22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow\r\nto the hurt of the kings?  4:23 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nletter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their\r\ncompanions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made\r\nthem to cease by force and power.\r\n\r\n4:24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem.\r\nSo it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\n5:1 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of\r\nIddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the\r\nname of the God of Israel, even unto them.\r\n\r\n5:2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son\r\nof Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem:\r\nand with them were the prophets of God helping them.\r\n\r\n5:3 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the\r\nriver, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto\r\nthem, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this\r\nwall?  5:4 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the\r\nnames of the men that make this building?  5:5 But the eye of their\r\nGod was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to\r\ncease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer\r\nby letter concerning this matter.\r\n\r\n5:6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the\r\nriver, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which\r\nwere on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 5:7 They sent\r\na letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n5:8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of\r\nJudea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great\r\nstones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on,\r\nand prospereth in their hands.\r\n\r\n5:9 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded\r\nyou to build this house, and to make up these walls?  5:10 We asked\r\ntheir names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of\r\nthe men that were the chief of them.\r\n\r\n5:11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of\r\nthe God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded\r\nthese many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.\r\n\r\n5:12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto\r\nwrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of\r\nBabylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the\r\npeople away into Babylon.\r\n\r\n5:13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king\r\nCyrus made a decree to build this house of God.\r\n\r\n5:14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,\r\nwhich Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and\r\nbrought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take\r\nout of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose\r\nname was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 5:15 And said unto\r\nhim, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in\r\nJerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.\r\n\r\n5:16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the\r\nhouse of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now\r\nhath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.\r\n\r\n5:17 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search\r\nmade in the king\xe2\x80\x99s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether\r\nit be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house\r\nof God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us\r\nconcerning this matter.\r\n\r\n6:1 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the\r\nhouse of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.\r\n\r\n6:2 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the\r\nprovince of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:\r\n6:3 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a\r\ndecree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be\r\nbuilded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the\r\nfoundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore\r\ncubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 6:4 With three rows\r\nof great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be\r\ngiven out of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house: 6:5 And also let the golden and silver\r\nvessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of\r\nthe temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be\r\nrestored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem,\r\nevery one to his place, and place them in the house of God.\r\n\r\n6:6 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai,\r\nand your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be\r\nye far from thence: 6:7 Let the work of this house of God alone; let\r\nthe governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house\r\nof God in his place.\r\n\r\n6:8 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these\r\nJews for the building of this house of God: that of the king\xe2\x80\x99s goods,\r\neven of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto\r\nthese men, that they be not hindered.\r\n\r\n6:9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams,\r\nand lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt,\r\nwine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are\r\nat Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 6:10 That\r\nthey may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and\r\npray for the life of the king, and of his sons.\r\n\r\n6:11 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word,\r\nlet timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be\r\nhanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.\r\n\r\n6:12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all\r\nkings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy\r\nthis house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree;\r\nlet it be done with speed.\r\n\r\n6:13 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and\r\ntheir companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so\r\nthey did speedily.\r\n\r\n6:14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through\r\nthe prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.\r\nAnd they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the\r\nGod of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius,\r\nand Artaxerxes king of Persia.\r\n\r\n6:15 And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,\r\nwhich was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.\r\n\r\n6:16 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the\r\nrest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this\r\nhouse of God with joy.\r\n\r\n6:17 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred\r\nbullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering\r\nfor all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n6:18 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in\r\ntheir courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is\r\nwritten in the book of Moses.\r\n\r\n6:19 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the\r\nfourteenth day of the first month.\r\n\r\n6:20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of\r\nthem were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the\r\ncaptivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.\r\n\r\n6:21 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of\r\ncaptivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the\r\nfilthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel,\r\ndid eat, 6:22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with\r\njoy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the\r\nking of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of\r\nthe house of God, the God of Israel.\r\n\r\n7:1 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,\r\nEzra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 7:2\r\nThe son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 7:3 The son\r\nof Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 7:4 The son of\r\nZerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 7:5 The son of Abishua,\r\nthe son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief\r\npriest: 7:6 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe\r\nin the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the\r\nking granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD\r\nhis God upon him.\r\n\r\n7:7 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the\r\npriests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the\r\nNethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.\r\n\r\n7:8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the\r\nseventh year of the king.\r\n\r\n7:9 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from\r\nBabylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem,\r\naccording to the good hand of his God upon him.\r\n\r\n7:10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and\r\nto do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.\r\n\r\n7:11 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave\r\nunto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the\r\ncommandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.\r\n\r\n7:12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the\r\nlaw of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.\r\n\r\n7:13 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of\r\nhis priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own\r\nfreewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.\r\n\r\n7:14 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven\r\ncounsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to\r\nthe law of thy God which is in thine hand; 7:15 And to carry the\r\nsilver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely\r\noffered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 7:16\r\nAnd all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province\r\nof Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the\r\npriests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in\r\nJerusalem: 7:17 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money\r\nbullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink\r\nofferings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God\r\nwhich is in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n7:18 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to\r\ndo with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of\r\nyour God.\r\n\r\n7:19 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house\r\nof thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n7:20 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,\r\nwhich thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreasure house.\r\n\r\n7:21 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the\r\ntreasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the\r\npriest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of\r\nyou, it be done speedily, 7:22 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and\r\nto an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and\r\nto an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.\r\n\r\n7:23 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be\r\ndiligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should\r\nthere be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?  7:24 Also\r\nwe certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers,\r\nporters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be\r\nlawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.\r\n\r\n7:25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine\r\nhand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that\r\nare beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach\r\nye them that know them not.\r\n\r\n7:26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the\r\nking, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto\r\ndeath, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n7:27 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a\r\nthing as this in the king\xe2\x80\x99s heart, to beautify the house of the LORD\r\nwhich is in Jerusalem: 7:28 And hath extended mercy unto me before the\r\nking, and his counsellors, and before all the king\xe2\x80\x99s mighty princes.\r\nAnd I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and\r\nI gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.\r\n\r\n8:1 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the\r\ngenealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of\r\nArtaxerxes the king.\r\n\r\n8:2 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:\r\nof the sons of David; Hattush.\r\n\r\n8:3 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and\r\nwith him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\n8:4 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with\r\nhim two hundred males.\r\n\r\n8:5 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three\r\nhundred males.\r\n\r\n8:6 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him\r\nfifty males.\r\n\r\n8:7 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with\r\nhim seventy males.\r\n\r\n8:8 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and\r\nwith him fourscore males.\r\n\r\n8:9 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two\r\nhundred and eighteen males.\r\n\r\n8:10 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him\r\nan hundred and threescore males.\r\n\r\n8:11 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with\r\nhim twenty and eight males.\r\n\r\n8:12 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with\r\nhim an hundred and ten males.\r\n\r\n8:13 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,\r\nEliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.\r\n\r\n8:14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them\r\nseventy males.\r\n\r\n8:15 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava;\r\nand there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and\r\nthe priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.\r\n\r\n8:16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for\r\nElnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for\r\nZechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for\r\nElnathan, men of understanding.\r\n\r\n8:17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place\r\nCasiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his\r\nbrethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring\r\nunto us ministers for the house of our God.\r\n\r\n8:18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of\r\nunderstanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of\r\nIsrael; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 8:19\r\nAnd Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his\r\nbrethren and their sons, twenty; 8:20 Also of the Nethinims, whom\r\nDavid and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites,\r\ntwo hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.\r\n\r\n8:21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we\r\nmight afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for\r\nus, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.\r\n\r\n8:22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and\r\nhorsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had\r\nspoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for\r\ngood that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them\r\nthat forsake him.\r\n\r\n8:23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n8:24 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,\r\nHashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 8:25 And weighed unto\r\nthem the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of\r\nthe house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his\r\nlords, and all Israel there present, had offered: 8:26 I even weighed\r\nunto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver\r\nvessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; 8:27 Also\r\ntwenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine\r\ncopper, precious as gold.\r\n\r\n8:28 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are\r\nholy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto\r\nthe LORD God of your fathers.\r\n\r\n8:29 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of\r\nthe priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at\r\nJerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and\r\nthe gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house\r\nof our God.\r\n\r\n8:31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of\r\nthe first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was\r\nupon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such\r\nas lay in wait by the way.\r\n\r\n8:32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.\r\n\r\n8:33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels\r\nweighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of\r\nUriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and\r\nwith them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of\r\nBinnui, Levites; 8:34 By number and by weight of every one: and all\r\nthe weight was written at that time.\r\n\r\n8:35 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were\r\ncome out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of\r\nIsrael, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy\r\nand seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a\r\nburnt offering unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:36 And they delivered the king\xe2\x80\x99s commissions unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they\r\nfurthered the people, and the house of God.\r\n\r\n9:1 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying,\r\nThe people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not\r\nseparated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to\r\ntheir abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the\r\nPerizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians,\r\nand the Amorites.\r\n\r\n9:2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for\r\ntheir sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the\r\npeople of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath\r\nbeen chief in this trespass.\r\n\r\n9:3 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and\r\nplucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down\r\nastonied.\r\n\r\n9:4 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words\r\nof the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had\r\nbeen carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.\r\n\r\n9:5 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and\r\nhaving rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread\r\nout my hands unto the LORD my God, 9:6 And said, O my God, I am\r\nashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our\r\niniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up\r\nunto the heavens.\r\n\r\n9:7 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass\r\nunto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our\r\npriests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to\r\nthe sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as\r\nit is this day.\r\n\r\n9:8 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD\r\nour God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his\r\nholy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little\r\nreviving in our bondage.\r\n\r\n9:9 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our\r\nbondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of\r\nPersia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to\r\nrepair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n9:10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have\r\nforsaken thy commandments, 9:11 Which thou hast commanded by thy\r\nservants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess\r\nit, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,\r\nwith their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another\r\nwith their uncleanness.\r\n\r\n9:12 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither\r\ntake their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their\r\nwealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land,\r\nand leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.\r\n\r\n9:13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for\r\nour great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less\r\nthan our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as\r\nthis; 9:14 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in\r\naffinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be\r\nangry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no\r\nremnant nor escaping?  9:15 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous:\r\nfor we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before\r\nthee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n10:1 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and\r\ncasting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him\r\nout of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children:\r\nfor the people wept very sore.\r\n\r\n10:2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,\r\nanswered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and\r\nhave taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is\r\nhope in Israel concerning this thing.\r\n\r\n10:3 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all\r\nthe wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of\r\nmy lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and\r\nlet it be done according to the law.\r\n\r\n10:4 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with\r\nthee: be of good courage, and do it.\r\n\r\n10:5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all\r\nIsrael, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they\r\nsware.\r\n\r\n10:6 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the\r\nchamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he\r\ndid eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the\r\ntransgression of them that had been carried away.\r\n\r\n10:7 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto\r\nall the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves\r\ntogether unto Jerusalem; 10:8 And that whosoever would not come within\r\nthree days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders,\r\nall his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the\r\ncongregation of those that had been carried away.\r\n\r\n10:9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves\r\ntogether unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on\r\nthe twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street\r\nof the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the\r\ngreat rain.\r\n\r\n10:10 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have\r\ntransgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n10:11 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,\r\nand do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the\r\nland, and from the strange wives.\r\n\r\n10:12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,\r\nAs thou hast said, so must we do.\r\n\r\n10:13 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we\r\nare not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or\r\ntwo: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.\r\n\r\n10:14 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all\r\nthem which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed\r\ntimes, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof,\r\nuntil the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.\r\n\r\n10:15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah\r\nwere employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the\r\nLevite helped them.\r\n\r\n10:16 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,\r\nwith certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers,\r\nand all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the\r\nfirst day of the tenth month to examine the matter.\r\n\r\n10:17 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange\r\nwives by the first day of the first month.\r\n\r\n10:18 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had\r\ntaken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak,\r\nand his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.\r\n\r\n10:19 And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives;\r\nand being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.\r\n\r\n10:20 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.\r\n\r\n10:21 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,\r\nand Jehiel, and Uzziah.\r\n\r\n10:22 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,\r\nNethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.\r\n\r\n10:23 Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same\r\nis Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.\r\n\r\n10:24 Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and\r\nTelem, and Uri.\r\n\r\n10:25 Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,\r\nand Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.\r\n\r\n10:26 And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and\r\nAbdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.\r\n\r\n10:27 And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and\r\nJeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.\r\n\r\n10:28 Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and\r\nAthlai.\r\n\r\n10:29 And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub,\r\nand Sheal, and Ramoth.\r\n\r\n10:30 And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah,\r\nMaaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.\r\n\r\n10:31 And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah,\r\nShimeon, 10:32 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.\r\n\r\n10:33 Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,\r\nJeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.\r\n\r\n10:34 Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel, 10:35 Benaiah,\r\nBedeiah, Chelluh, 10:36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 10:37 Mattaniah,\r\nMattenai, and Jaasau, 10:38 And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei, 10:39 And\r\nShelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah, 10:40 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,\r\n10:41 Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah, 10:42 Shallum, Amariah, and\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n10:43 Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,\r\nand Joel, Benaiah.\r\n\r\n10:44 All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by\r\nwhom they had children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Nehemiah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass\r\nin the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the\r\npalace, 1:2 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men\r\nof Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which\r\nwere left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:3 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity\r\nthere in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall\r\nof Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned\r\nwith fire.\r\n\r\n1:4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and\r\nwept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God\r\nof heaven, 1:5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the\r\ngreat and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that\r\nlove him and observe his commandments: 1:6 Let thine ear now be\r\nattentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of\r\nthy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the\r\nchildren of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children\r\nof Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse have sinned.\r\n\r\n1:7 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the\r\ncommandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou\r\ncommandedst thy servant Moses.\r\n\r\n1:8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy\r\nservant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad\r\namong the nations: 1:9 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my\r\ncommandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the\r\nuttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and\r\nwill bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n1:10 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast\r\nredeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.\r\n\r\n1:11 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the\r\nprayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire\r\nto fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and\r\ngrant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncupbearer.\r\n\r\n2:1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of\r\nArtaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine,\r\nand gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n2:2 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,\r\nseeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.\r\nThen I was very sore afraid, 2:3 And said unto the king, Let the king\r\nlive for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city,\r\nthe place of my fathers\xe2\x80\x99 sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates\r\nthereof are consumed with fire?  2:4 Then the king said unto me, For\r\nwhat dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.\r\n\r\n2:5 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy\r\nservant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me\r\nunto Judah, unto the city of my fathers\xe2\x80\x99 sepulchres, that I may build\r\nit.\r\n\r\n2:6 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For\r\nhow long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it\r\npleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\r\n\r\n2:7 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters\r\nbe given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me\r\nover till I come into Judah; 2:8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the\r\ngates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall\r\nof the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king\r\ngranted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.\r\n\r\n2:9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and\r\nhorsemen with me.\r\n\r\n2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the\r\nAmmonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come\r\na man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n2:11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.\r\n\r\n2:12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither\r\ntold I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem:\r\nneither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.\r\n\r\n2:13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before\r\nthe dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of\r\nJerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed\r\nwith fire.\r\n\r\n2:14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.\r\n\r\n2:15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,\r\nand turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n2:16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither\r\nhad I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the\r\nnobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.\r\n\r\n2:17 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how\r\nJerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire:\r\ncome, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n2:18 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as\r\nalso the king\xe2\x80\x99s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let\r\nus rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the\r\nAmmonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn,\r\nand despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye\r\nrebel against the king?  2:20 Then answered I them, and said unto\r\nthem, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants\r\nwill arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial,\r\nin Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3:1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the\r\npriests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set\r\nup the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it,\r\nunto the tower of Hananeel.\r\n\r\n3:2 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them\r\nbuilded Zaccur the son of Imri.\r\n\r\n3:3 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid\r\nthe beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,\r\nand the bars thereof.\r\n\r\n3:4 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of\r\nKoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the\r\nson of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of\r\nBaana.\r\n\r\n3:5 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not\r\ntheir necks to the work of their LORD.\r\n\r\n3:6 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and\r\nMeshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set\r\nup the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.\r\n\r\n3:7 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the\r\nMeronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the\r\ngovernor on this side the river.\r\n\r\n3:8 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the\r\ngoldsmiths.\r\n\r\nNext unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the\r\napothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.\r\n\r\n3:9 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of\r\nthe half part of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3:10 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even\r\nover against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of\r\nHashabniah.\r\n\r\n3:11 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,\r\nrepaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.\r\n\r\n3:12 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler\r\nof the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.\r\n\r\n3:13 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;\r\nthey built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and\r\nthe bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n3:14 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler\r\nof part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof,\r\nthe locks thereof, and the bars thereof.\r\n\r\n3:15 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of\r\nColhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it,\r\nand set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof,\r\nand the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king\xe2\x80\x99s garden, and unto the\r\nstairs that go down from the city of David.\r\n\r\n3:16 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the\r\nhalf part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of\r\nDavid, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the\r\nmighty.\r\n\r\n3:17 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto\r\nhim repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his\r\npart.\r\n\r\n3:18 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the\r\nruler of the half part of Keilah.\r\n\r\n3:19 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of\r\nMizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the\r\nturning of the wall.\r\n\r\n3:20 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other\r\npiece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of\r\nEliashib the high priest.\r\n\r\n3:21 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz\r\nanother piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end\r\nof the house of Eliashib.\r\n\r\n3:22 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.\r\n\r\n3:23 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house.\r\n\r\nAfter him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\n3:24 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from\r\nthe house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n3:25 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and\r\nthe tower which lieth out from the king\xe2\x80\x99s high house, that was by the\r\ncourt of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.\r\n\r\n3:26 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over\r\nagainst the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.\r\n\r\n3:27 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the\r\ngreat tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.\r\n\r\n3:28 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over\r\nagainst his house.\r\n\r\n3:29 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAfter him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of\r\nthe east gate.\r\n\r\n3:30 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the\r\nsixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the\r\nson of Berechiah over against his chamber.\r\n\r\n3:31 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s son unto the place of\r\nthe Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad,\r\nand to the going up of the corner.\r\n\r\n3:32 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate\r\nrepaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.\r\n\r\n4:1 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the\r\nwall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.\r\n\r\n4:2 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and\r\nsaid, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will\r\nthey sacrifice?  will they make an end in a day? will they revive the\r\nstones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?  4:3 Now\r\nTobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they\r\nbuild, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.\r\n\r\n4:4 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon\r\ntheir own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 4:5\r\nAnd cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out\r\nfrom before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the\r\nbuilders.\r\n\r\n4:6 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto\r\nthe half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.\r\n\r\n4:7 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the\r\nArabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls\r\nof Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped,\r\nthen they were very wroth, 4:8 And conspired all of them together to\r\ncome and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.\r\n\r\n4:9 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch\r\nagainst them day and night, because of them.\r\n\r\n4:10 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is\r\ndecayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n4:11 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till\r\nwe come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to\r\ncease.\r\n\r\n4:12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,\r\nthey said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return\r\nunto us they will be upon you.\r\n\r\n4:13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the\r\nhigher places, I even set the people after their families with their\r\nswords, their spears, and their bows.\r\n\r\n4:14 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the\r\nrulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:\r\nremember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your\r\nbrethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.\r\n\r\n4:15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known\r\nunto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned\r\nall of us to the wall, every one unto his work.\r\n\r\n4:16 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my\r\nservants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the\r\nspears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers\r\nwere behind all the house of Judah.\r\n\r\n4:17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with\r\nthose that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work,\r\nand with the other hand held a weapon.\r\n\r\n4:18 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and\r\nso builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.\r\n\r\n4:19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of\r\nthe people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the\r\nwall, one far from another.\r\n\r\n4:20 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort\r\nye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.\r\n\r\n4:21 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from\r\nthe rising of the morning till the stars appeared.\r\n\r\n4:22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one\r\nwith his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be\r\na guard to us, and labour on the day.\r\n\r\n4:23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of\r\nthe guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving\r\nthat every one put them off for washing.\r\n\r\n5:1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against\r\ntheir brethren the Jews.\r\n\r\n5:2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are\r\nmany: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.\r\n\r\n5:3 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,\r\nvineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.\r\n\r\n5:4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.\r\n\r\n5:5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as\r\ntheir children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our\r\ndaughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto\r\nbondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other\r\nmen have our lands and vineyards.\r\n\r\n5:6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.\r\n\r\n5:7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the\r\nrulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.\r\nAnd I set a great assembly against them.\r\n\r\n5:8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our\r\nbrethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even\r\nsell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they\r\ntheir peace, and found nothing to answer.\r\n\r\n5:9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in\r\nthe fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our\r\nenemies?  5:10 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might\r\nexact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.\r\n\r\n5:11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their\r\nvineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part\r\nof the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n5:12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of\r\nthem; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and\r\ntook an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.\r\n\r\n5:13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from\r\nhis house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even\r\nthus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said,\r\nAmen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n5:14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor\r\nin the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and\r\nthirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my\r\nbrethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.\r\n\r\n5:15 But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable\r\nunto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty\r\nshekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people:\r\nbut so did not I, because of the fear of God.\r\n\r\n5:16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we\r\nany land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.\r\n\r\n5:17 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews\r\nand rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that\r\nare about us.\r\n\r\n5:18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six\r\nchoice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days\r\nstore of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread\r\nof the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.\r\n\r\n5:19 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have\r\ndone for this people.\r\n\r\n6:1 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the\r\nArabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the\r\nwall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time\r\nI had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 6:2 That Sanballat and\r\nGeshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of\r\nthe villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.\r\n\r\n6:3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work,\r\nso that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave\r\nit, and come down to you?  6:4 Yet they sent unto me four times after\r\nthis sort; and I answered them after the same manner.\r\n\r\n6:5 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth\r\ntime with an open letter in his hand; 6:6 Wherein was written, It is\r\nreported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the\r\nJews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou\r\nmayest be their king, according to these words.\r\n\r\n6:7 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at\r\nJerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be\r\nreported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and\r\nlet us take counsel together.\r\n\r\n6:8 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as\r\nthou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.\r\n\r\n6:9 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened\r\nfrom the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen\r\nmy hands.\r\n\r\n6:10 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah\r\nthe son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet\r\ntogether in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the\r\ndoors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the\r\nnight will they come to slay thee.\r\n\r\n6:11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,\r\nbeing as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not\r\ngo in.\r\n\r\n6:12 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he\r\npronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had\r\nhired him.\r\n\r\n6:13 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and\r\nsin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they\r\nmight reproach me.\r\n\r\n6:14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these\r\ntheir works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the\r\nprophets, that would have put me in fear.\r\n\r\n6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month\r\nElul, in fifty and two days.\r\n\r\n6:16 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and\r\nall the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much\r\ncast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was\r\nwrought of our God.\r\n\r\n6:17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto\r\nTobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.\r\n\r\n6:18 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the\r\nson in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had\r\ntaken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.\r\n\r\n6:19 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words\r\nto him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.\r\n\r\n7:1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the\r\ndoors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,\r\n7:2 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the\r\npalace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared\r\nGod above many.\r\n\r\n7:3 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened\r\nuntil the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the\r\ndoors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\n7:4 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein,\r\nand the houses were not builded.\r\n\r\n7:5 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and\r\nthe rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.\r\nAnd I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the\r\nfirst, and found written therein, 7:6 These are the children of the\r\nprovince, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been\r\ncarried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried\r\naway, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his\r\ncity; 7:7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah,\r\nRaamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum,\r\nBaanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was\r\nthis; 7:8 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n7:9 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.\r\n\r\n7:10 The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.\r\n\r\n7:11 The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab,\r\ntwo thousand and eight hundred and eighteen.\r\n\r\n7:12 The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.\r\n\r\n7:13 The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five.\r\n\r\n7:14 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.\r\n\r\n7:15 The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight.\r\n\r\n7:16 The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight.\r\n\r\n7:17 The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty and two.\r\n\r\n7:18 The children of Adonikam, six hundred threescore and seven.\r\n\r\n7:19 The children of Bigvai, two thousand threescore and seven.\r\n\r\n7:20 The children of Adin, six hundred fifty and five.\r\n\r\n7:21 The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.\r\n\r\n7:22 The children of Hashum, three hundred twenty and eight.\r\n\r\n7:23 The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four.\r\n\r\n7:24 The children of Hariph, an hundred and twelve.\r\n\r\n7:25 The children of Gibeon, ninety and five.\r\n\r\n7:26 The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, an hundred fourscore and\r\neight.\r\n\r\n7:27 The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight.\r\n\r\n7:28 The men of Bethazmaveth, forty and two.\r\n\r\n7:29 The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred\r\nforty and three.\r\n\r\n7:30 The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one.\r\n\r\n7:31 The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.\r\n\r\n7:32 The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three.\r\n\r\n7:33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.\r\n\r\n7:34 The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n7:35 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\n7:36 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.\r\n\r\n7:37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and\r\none.\r\n\r\n7:38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.\r\n\r\n7:39 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua,\r\nnine hundred seventy and three.\r\n\r\n7:40 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.\r\n\r\n7:41 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.\r\n\r\n7:42 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.\r\n\r\n7:43 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the\r\nchildren of Hodevah, seventy and four.\r\n\r\n7:44 The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred forty and eight.\r\n\r\n7:45 The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the\r\nchildren of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the\r\nchildren of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.\r\n\r\n7:46 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha,\r\nthe children of Tabbaoth, 7:47 The children of Keros, the children of\r\nSia, the children of Padon, 7:48 The children of Lebana, the children\r\nof Hagaba, the children of Shalmai, 7:49 The children of Hanan, the\r\nchildren of Giddel, the children of Gahar, 7:50 The children of\r\nReaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, 7:51 The\r\nchildren of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah,\r\n7:52 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of\r\nNephishesim, 7:53 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the\r\nchildren of Harhur, 7:54 The children of Bazlith, the children of\r\nMehida, the children of Harsha, 7:55 The children of Barkos, the\r\nchildren of Sisera, the children of Tamah, 7:56 The children of\r\nNeziah, the children of Hatipha.\r\n\r\n7:57 The children of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s servants: the children of Sotai, the\r\nchildren of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 7:58 The children of\r\nJaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 7:59 The\r\nchildren of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of\r\nPochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.\r\n\r\n7:60 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s servants, were\r\nthree hundred ninety and two.\r\n\r\n7:61 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha,\r\nCherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.\r\n\r\n7:62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of\r\nNekoda, six hundred forty and two.\r\n\r\n7:63 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz,\r\nthe children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of\r\nBarzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.\r\n\r\n7:64 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by\r\ngenealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put\r\nfrom the priesthood.\r\n\r\n7:65 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the\r\nmost holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.\r\n\r\n7:66 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three\r\nhundred and threescore, 7:67 Beside their manservants and their\r\nmaidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty\r\nand seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and\r\nsinging women.\r\n\r\n7:68 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two\r\nhundred forty and five: 7:69 Their camels, four hundred thirty and\r\nfive: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.\r\n\r\n7:70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The\r\nTirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons,\r\nfive hundred and thirty priests\xe2\x80\x99 garments.\r\n\r\n7:71 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the\r\nwork twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred\r\npound of silver.\r\n\r\n7:72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand\r\ndrams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and\r\nseven priests\xe2\x80\x99 garments.\r\n\r\n7:73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the\r\nsingers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel,\r\ndwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children\r\nof Israel were in their cities.\r\n\r\n8:1 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into\r\nthe street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra\r\nthe scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had\r\ncommanded to Israel.\r\n\r\n8:2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both\r\nof men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the\r\nfirst day of the seventh month.\r\n\r\n8:3 And he read therein before the street that was before the water\r\ngate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and\r\nthose that could understand; and the ears of all the people were\r\nattentive unto the book of the law.\r\n\r\n8:4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had\r\nmade for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and\r\nAnaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and\r\non his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and\r\nHashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.\r\n\r\n8:5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he\r\nwas above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood\r\nup: 8:6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people\r\nanswered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed\r\ntheir heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.\r\n\r\n8:7 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,\r\nHodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the\r\nLevites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood\r\nin their place.\r\n\r\n8:8 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave\r\nthe sense, and caused them to understand the reading.\r\n\r\n8:9 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the\r\nscribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the\r\npeople, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.\r\nFor all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.\r\n\r\n8:10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the\r\nsweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for\r\nthis day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of\r\nthe LORD is your strength.\r\n\r\n8:11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace,\r\nfor the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.\r\n\r\n8:12 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to\r\nsend portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood\r\nthe words that were declared unto them.\r\n\r\n8:13 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the\r\nfathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the\r\nscribe, even to understand the words of the law.\r\n\r\n8:14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by\r\nMoses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast\r\nof the seventh month: 8:15 And that they should publish and proclaim\r\nin all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the\r\nmount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle\r\nbranches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make\r\nbooths, as it is written.\r\n\r\n8:16 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves\r\nbooths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and\r\nin the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water\r\ngate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.\r\n\r\n8:17 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the\r\ncaptivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of\r\nJeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel\r\ndone so. And there was very great gladness.\r\n\r\n8:18 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in\r\nthe book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on\r\nthe eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.\r\n\r\n9:1 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of\r\nIsrael were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n9:2 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers,\r\nand stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n9:3 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law\r\nof the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth\r\npart they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.\r\n\r\n9:4 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,\r\nKadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried\r\nwith a loud voice unto the LORD their God.\r\n\r\n9:5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,\r\nSherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless\r\nthe LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name,\r\nwhich is exalted above all blessing and praise.\r\n\r\n9:6 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven\r\nof heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are\r\ntherein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them\r\nall; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.\r\n\r\n9:7 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest\r\nhim forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of\r\nAbraham; 9:8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a\r\ncovenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites,\r\nthe Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the\r\nGirgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy\r\nwords; for thou art righteous: 9:9 And didst see the affliction of our\r\nfathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; 9:10 And\r\nshewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and\r\non all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt\r\nproudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n9:11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went\r\nthrough the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors\r\nthou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.\r\n\r\n9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in\r\nthe night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein\r\nthey should go.\r\n\r\n9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them\r\nfrom heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good\r\nstatutes and commandments: 9:14 And madest known unto them thy holy\r\nsabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the\r\nhand of Moses thy servant: 9:15 And gavest them bread from heaven for\r\ntheir hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for\r\ntheir thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess\r\nthe land which thou hadst sworn to give them.\r\n\r\n9:16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks,\r\nand hearkened not to thy commandments, 9:17 And refused to obey,\r\nneither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but\r\nhardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to\r\nreturn to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious\r\nand merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest\r\nthem not.\r\n\r\n9:18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy\r\nGod that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great\r\nprovocations; 9:19 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them\r\nnot in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them\r\nby day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night,\r\nto shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.\r\n\r\n9:20 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and\r\nwithheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for\r\ntheir thirst.\r\n\r\n9:21 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so\r\nthat they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet\r\nswelled not.\r\n\r\n9:22 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide\r\nthem into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land\r\nof the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.\r\n\r\n9:23 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and\r\nbroughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to\r\ntheir fathers, that they should go in to possess it.\r\n\r\n9:24 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou\r\nsubduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and\r\ngavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the\r\nland, that they might do with them as they would.\r\n\r\n9:25 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses\r\nfull of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit\r\ntrees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat,\r\nand delighted themselves in thy great goodness.\r\n\r\n9:26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,\r\nand cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which\r\ntestified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great\r\nprovocations.\r\n\r\n9:27 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies,\r\nwho vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto\r\nthee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold\r\nmercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\n9:28 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:\r\ntherefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they\r\nhad the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto\r\nthee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou\r\ndeliver them according to thy mercies; 9:29 And testifiedst against\r\nthem, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt\r\nproudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against\r\nthy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and\r\nwithdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.\r\n\r\n9:30 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against\r\nthem by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear:\r\ntherefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.\r\n\r\n9:31 Nevertheless for thy great mercies\xe2\x80\x99 sake thou didst not utterly\r\nconsume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n9:32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible\r\nGod, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem\r\nlittle before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our\r\nprinces, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers,\r\nand on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n9:33 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou\r\nhast done right, but we have done wickedly: 9:34 Neither have our\r\nkings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor\r\nhearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou\r\ndidst testify against them.\r\n\r\n9:35 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great\r\ngoodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which\r\nthou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.\r\n\r\n9:36 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou\r\ngavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof,\r\nbehold, we are servants in it: 9:37 And it yieldeth much increase unto\r\nthe kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they\r\nhave dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure,\r\nand we are in great distress.\r\n\r\n9:38 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;\r\nand our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.\r\n\r\n10:1 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of\r\nHachaliah, and Zidkijah, 10:2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 10:3 Pashur,\r\nAmariah, Malchijah, 10:4 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 10:5 Harim,\r\nMeremoth, Obadiah, 10:6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 10:7 Meshullam,\r\nAbijah, Mijamin, 10:8 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n10:9 And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the\r\nsons of Henadad, Kadmiel;

10:30 And that we would not give our daughters unto the\r\npeople of the land, not take their daughters for our sons: 10:31 And\r\nif the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath\r\nday to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on\r\nthe holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the\r\nexaction of every debt.\r\n\r\n10:32 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with\r\nthe third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;\r\n10:33 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for\r\nthe continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for\r\nthe set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to\r\nmake an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n10:34 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the\r\npeople, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God,\r\nafter the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to\r\nburn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:\r\n10:35 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits\r\nof all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD:\r\n10:36 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is\r\nwritten in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks,\r\nto bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in\r\nthe house of our God: 10:37 And that we should bring the firstfruits\r\nof our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees,\r\nof wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of\r\nour God;

Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,\r\nand Hananiah, with trumpets; 12:42 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and\r\nEleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.\r\nAnd the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.\r\n\r\n12:43 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for\r\nGod had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the\r\nchildren rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar\r\noff.\r\n\r\n12:44 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the\r\ntreasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes,\r\nto gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of\r\nthe law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the\r\npriests and for the Levites that waited.\r\n\r\n12:45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God,\r\nand the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of\r\nDavid, and of Solomon his son.\r\n\r\n12:46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of\r\nthe singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.\r\n\r\n12:47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of\r\nNehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day\r\nhis portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the\r\nLevites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.\r\n\r\n13:1 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the\r\npeople; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the\r\nMoabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; 13:2\r\nBecause they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water,\r\nbut hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our\r\nGod turned the curse into a blessing.\r\n\r\n13:3 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they\r\nseparated from Israel all the mixed multitude.\r\n\r\n13:4 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the\r\nchamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: 13:5 And he\r\nhad prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the\r\nmeat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of\r\nthe corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given\r\nto the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of\r\nthe priests.\r\n\r\n13:6 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and\r\nthirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and\r\nafter certain days obtained I leave of the king: 13:7 And I came to\r\nJerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in\r\npreparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.\r\n\r\n13:8 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household\r\nstuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.\r\n\r\n13:9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither\r\nbrought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat\r\noffering and the frankincense.\r\n\r\n13:10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been\r\ngiven them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were\r\nfled every one to his field.\r\n\r\n13:11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of\r\nGod forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n13:12 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine\r\nand the oil unto the treasuries.\r\n\r\n13:13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,\r\nand Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them\r\nwas Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were\r\ncounted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n13:14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good\r\ndeeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n13:15 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the\r\nsabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine,\r\ngrapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into\r\nJerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day\r\nwherein they sold victuals.\r\n\r\n13:16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and\r\nall manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of\r\nJudah, and in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n13:17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,\r\nWhat evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?\r\n13:18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this\r\nevil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel\r\nby profaning the sabbath.\r\n\r\n13:19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to\r\nbe dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut,\r\nand charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and\r\nsome of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be\r\nbrought in on the sabbath day.\r\n\r\n13:20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without\r\nJerusalem once or twice.\r\n\r\n13:21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye\r\nabout the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that\r\ntime forth came they no more on the sabbath.\r\n\r\n13:22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,\r\nand that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath\r\nday.\r\n\r\nRemember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to\r\nthe greatness of thy mercy.\r\n\r\n13:23 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod,\r\nof Ammon, and of Moab: 13:24 And their children spake half in the\r\nspeech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 language, but\r\naccording to the language of each people.\r\n\r\n13:25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of\r\nthem, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying,\r\nYe shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their\r\ndaughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.\r\n\r\n13:26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among\r\nmany nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God,\r\nand God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did\r\noutlandish women cause to sin.\r\n\r\n13:27 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to\r\ntransgress against our God in marrying strange wives?  13:28 And one\r\nof the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in\r\nlaw to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.\r\n\r\n13:29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the\r\npriesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.\r\n\r\n13:30 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards\r\nof the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; 13:31 And\r\nfor the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits.\r\nRemember me, O my God, for good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Esther\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus\r\nwhich reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and\r\nseven and twenty provinces:) 1:2 That in those days, when the king\r\nAhasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the\r\npalace, 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all\r\nhis princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the\r\nnobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: 1:4 When he\r\nshewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his\r\nexcellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.\r\n\r\n1:5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all\r\nthe people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great\r\nand small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalace; 1:6 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with\r\ncords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble:\r\nthe beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue,\r\nand white, and black, marble.\r\n\r\n1:7 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being\r\ndiverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to\r\nthe state of the king.\r\n\r\n1:8 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so\r\nthe king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they\r\nshould do according to every man\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure.\r\n\r\n1:9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal\r\nhouse which belonged to king Ahasuerus.\r\n\r\n1:10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with\r\nwine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,\r\nZethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence\r\nof Ahasuerus the king, 1:11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king\r\nwith the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty:\r\nfor she was fair to look on.\r\n\r\n1:12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment by\r\nhis chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger\r\nburned in him.\r\n\r\n1:13 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so\r\nwas the king\xe2\x80\x99s manner toward all that knew law and judgment: 1:14 And\r\nthe next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,\r\nMarsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) 1:15 What\r\nshall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath\r\nnot performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the\r\nchamberlains?  1:16 And Memucan answered before the king and the\r\nprinces, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but\r\nalso to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the\r\nprovinces of the king Ahasuerus.\r\n\r\n1:17 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so\r\nthat they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be\r\nreported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought\r\nin before him, but she came not.\r\n\r\n1:18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto\r\nall the king\xe2\x80\x99s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen.\r\nThus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.\r\n\r\n1:19 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him,\r\nand let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,\r\nthat it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king\r\nAhasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is\r\nbetter than she.\r\n\r\n1:20 And when the king\xe2\x80\x99s decree which he shall make shall be published\r\nthroughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give\r\nto their husbands honour, both to great and small.\r\n\r\n1:21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did\r\naccording to the word of Memucan: 1:22 For he sent letters into all\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s provinces, into every province according to the writing\r\nthereof, and to every people after their language, that every man\r\nshould bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published\r\naccording to the language of every people.\r\n\r\n2:1 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,\r\nhe remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\n2:2 Then said the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants that ministered unto him, Let there\r\nbe fair young virgins sought for the king: 2:3 And let the king\r\nappoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may\r\ngather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to\r\nthe house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for\r\npurification be given them: 2:4 And let the maiden which pleaseth the\r\nking be queen instead of Vashti.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing pleased the king; and he did so.\r\n\r\n2:5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was\r\nMordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a\r\nBenjamite; 2:6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the\r\ncaptivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah,\r\nwhom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.\r\n\r\n2:7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s daughter:\r\nfor she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and\r\nbeautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took\r\nfor his own daughter.\r\n\r\n2:8 So it came to pass, when the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment and his decree was\r\nheard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the\r\npalace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.\r\n\r\n2:9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and\r\nhe speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as\r\nbelonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her,\r\nout of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the\r\nbest place of the house of the women.\r\n\r\n2:10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai\r\nhad charged her that she should not shew it.\r\n\r\n2:11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.\r\n\r\n2:12 Now when every maid\xe2\x80\x99s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,\r\nafter that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the\r\nwomen, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to\r\nwit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours,\r\nand with other things for the purifying of the women;) 2:13 Then thus\r\ncame every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her\r\nto go with her out of the house of the women unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n2:14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the\r\nsecond house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no\r\nmore, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by\r\nname.\r\n\r\n2:15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of\r\nMordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto\r\nthe king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king\xe2\x80\x99s chamberlain,\r\nthe keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the\r\nsight of all them that looked upon her.\r\n\r\n2:16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in\r\nthe tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n2:17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained\r\ngrace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he\r\nset the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of\r\nVashti.\r\n\r\n2:18 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his\r\nservants, even Esther\xe2\x80\x99s feast; and he made a release to the provinces,\r\nand gave gifts, according to the state of the king.\r\n\r\n2:19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then\r\nMordecai sat in the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate.\r\n\r\n2:20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai\r\nhad charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as\r\nwhen she was brought up with him.\r\n\r\n2:21 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate, two of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door,\r\nwere wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.\r\n\r\n2:22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the\r\nqueen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n2:23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;\r\ntherefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the\r\nbook of the chronicles before the king.\r\n\r\n3:1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of\r\nHammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all\r\nthe princes that were with him.\r\n\r\n3:2 And all the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants, that were in the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate, bowed,\r\nand reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him.\r\nBut Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.\r\n\r\n3:3 Then the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants, which were in the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate, said unto\r\nMordecai, Why transgressest thou the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment?  3:4 Now it\r\ncame to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not\r\nunto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai\xe2\x80\x99s matters\r\nwould stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.\r\n\r\n3:5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,\r\nthen was Haman full of wrath.\r\n\r\n3:6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had\r\nshewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy\r\nall the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even\r\nthe people of Mordecai.\r\n\r\n3:7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year\r\nof king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from\r\nday to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is,\r\nthe month Adar.\r\n\r\n3:8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people\r\nscattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces\r\nof thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither\r\nkeep they the king\xe2\x80\x99s laws: therefore it is not for the king\xe2\x80\x99s profit\r\nto suffer them.\r\n\r\n3:9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be\r\ndestroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands\r\nof those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s treasuries.\r\n\r\n3:10 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman\r\nthe son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 enemy.\r\n\r\n3:11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the\r\npeople also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.\r\n\r\n3:12 Then were the king\xe2\x80\x99s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the\r\nfirst month, and there was written according to all that Haman had\r\ncommanded unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenants, and to the governors that were\r\nover every province, and to the rulers of every people of every\r\nprovince according to the writing thereof, and to every people after\r\ntheir language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and\r\nsealed with the king\xe2\x80\x99s ring.\r\n\r\n3:13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king\xe2\x80\x99s provinces,\r\nto destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and\r\nold, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth\r\nday of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the\r\nspoil of them for a prey.\r\n\r\n3:14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every\r\nprovince was published unto all people, that they should be ready\r\nagainst that day.\r\n\r\n3:15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment, and\r\nthe decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat\r\ndown to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.\r\n\r\n4:1 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his\r\nclothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst\r\nof the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 4:2 And came even\r\nbefore the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate: for none might enter into the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate\r\nclothed with sackcloth.\r\n\r\n4:3 And in every province, whithersoever the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment and\r\nhis decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting,\r\nand weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.\r\n\r\n4:4 So Esther\xe2\x80\x99s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then\r\nwas the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe\r\nMordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n4:5 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king\xe2\x80\x99s chamberlains,\r\nwhom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment\r\nto Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.\r\n\r\n4:6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,\r\nwhich was before the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate.\r\n\r\n4:7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of\r\nthe sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.\r\n\r\n4:8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was\r\ngiven at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to\r\ndeclare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the\r\nking, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him\r\nfor her people.\r\n\r\n4:9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.\r\n\r\n4:10 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto\r\nMordecai; 4:11 All the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and the people of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprovinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come\r\nunto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one\r\nlaw of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall\r\nhold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been\r\ncalled to come in unto the king these thirty days.\r\n\r\n4:12 And they told to Mordecai Esther\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n4:13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself\r\nthat thou shalt escape in the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, more than all the Jews.\r\n\r\n4:14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall\r\nthere enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another\r\nplace; but thou and thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house shall be destroyed: and who\r\nknoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\r\n4:15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 4:16 Go,\r\ngather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye\r\nfor me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and\r\nmy maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,\r\nwhich is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.\r\n\r\n4:17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther\r\nhad commanded him.\r\n\r\n5:1 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal\r\napparel, and stood in the inner court of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, over\r\nagainst the king\xe2\x80\x99s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in\r\nthe royal house, over against the gate of the house.\r\n\r\n5:2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the\r\ncourt, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to\r\nEsther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near,\r\nand touched the top of the sceptre.\r\n\r\n5:3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and\r\nwhat is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n5:4 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king\r\nand Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.\r\n\r\n5:5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as\r\nEsther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that\r\nEsther had prepared.\r\n\r\n5:6 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy\r\npetition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even\r\nto the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.\r\n\r\n5:7 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 5:8\r\nIf I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the\r\nking to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and\r\nHaman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do\r\nto morrow as the king hath said.\r\n\r\n5:9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but\r\nwhen Haman saw Mordecai in the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate, that he stood not up, nor\r\nmoved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.\r\n\r\n5:10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he\r\nsent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.\r\n\r\n5:11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude\r\nof his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him,\r\nand how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n5:12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in\r\nwith the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and\r\nto morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.\r\n\r\n5:13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the\r\nJew sitting at the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate.\r\n\r\n5:14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a\r\ngallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto\r\nthe king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily\r\nwith the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he\r\ncaused the gallows to be made.\r\n\r\n6:1 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring\r\nthe book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n6:2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and\r\nTeresh, two of the king\xe2\x80\x99s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who\r\nsought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.\r\n\r\n6:3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to\r\nMordecai for this? Then said the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants that ministered unto\r\nhim, There is nothing done for him.\r\n\r\n6:4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into\r\nthe outward court of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, to speak unto the king to hang\r\nMordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.\r\n\r\n6:5 And the king\xe2\x80\x99s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in\r\nthe court. And the king said, Let him come in.\r\n\r\n6:6 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done\r\nunto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in\r\nhis heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to\r\nmyself?  6:7 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king\r\ndelighteth to honour, 6:8 Let the royal apparel be brought which the\r\nking useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the\r\ncrown royal which is set upon his head: 6:9 And let this apparel and\r\nhorse be delivered to the hand of one of the king\xe2\x80\x99s most noble\r\nprinces, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth\r\nto honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city,\r\nand proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the\r\nking delighteth to honour.\r\n\r\n6:10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and\r\nthe horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that\r\nsitteth at the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n6:11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,\r\nand brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and\r\nproclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the\r\nking delighteth to honour.\r\n\r\n6:12 And Mordecai came again to the king\xe2\x80\x99s gate. But Haman hasted to\r\nhis house mourning, and having his head covered.\r\n\r\n6:13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing\r\nthat had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto\r\nhim, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast\r\nbegun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely\r\nfall before him.\r\n\r\n6:14 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther\r\nhad prepared.\r\n\r\n7:1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.\r\n\r\n7:2 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the\r\nbanquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be\r\ngranted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even\r\nto the half of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n7:3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in\r\nthy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me\r\nat my petition, and my people at my request: 7:4 For we are sold, I\r\nand my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we\r\nhad been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue,\r\nalthough the enemy could not countervail the king\xe2\x80\x99s damage.\r\n\r\n7:5 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen,\r\nWho is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?\r\n7:6 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.\r\nThen Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.\r\n\r\n7:7 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went\r\ninto the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his\r\nlife to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined\r\nagainst him by the king.\r\n\r\n7:8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of\r\nthe banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther\r\nwas. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the\r\nhouse? As the word went out of king\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, they covered Haman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n7:9 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,\r\nBehold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for\r\nMordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of\r\nHaman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.\r\n\r\n7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for\r\nMordecai. Then was the king\xe2\x80\x99s wrath pacified.\r\n\r\n8:1 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the\r\nJews\xe2\x80\x99 enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king;\r\nfor Esther had told what he was unto her.\r\n\r\n8:2 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and\r\ngave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of\r\nHaman.\r\n\r\n8:3 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his\r\nfeet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman\r\nthe Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.\r\n\r\n8:4 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther\r\narose, and stood before the king, 8:5 And said, If it please the king,\r\nand if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the\r\nking, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the\r\nletters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he\r\nwrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king\xe2\x80\x99s provinces: 8:6\r\nFor how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?\r\nor how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?  8:7 Then\r\nthe king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew,\r\nBehold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have\r\nhanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.\r\n\r\n8:8 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nand seal it with the king\xe2\x80\x99s ring: for the writing which is written in\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s name, and sealed with the king\xe2\x80\x99s ring, may no man reverse.\r\n\r\n8:9 Then were the king\xe2\x80\x99s scribes called at that time in the third\r\nmonth, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day\r\nthereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded\r\nunto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of\r\nthe provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty\r\nand seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing\r\nthereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews\r\naccording to their writing, and according to their language.\r\n\r\n8:10 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus\xe2\x80\x99 name, and sealed it with the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on\r\nmules, camels, and young dromedaries: 8:11 Wherein the king granted\r\nthe Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and\r\nto stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish,\r\nall the power of the people and province that would assault them, both\r\nlittle ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 8:12\r\nUpon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the\r\nthirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.\r\n\r\n8:13 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every\r\nprovince was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be\r\nready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.\r\n\r\n8:14 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being\r\nhastened and pressed on by the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment. And the decree was\r\ngiven at Shushan the palace.\r\n\r\n8:15 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal\r\napparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a\r\ngarment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and\r\nwas glad.\r\n\r\n8:16 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.\r\n\r\n8:17 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness,\r\na feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became\r\nJews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.\r\n\r\n9:1 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the\r\nthirteenth day of the same, when the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment and his decree\r\ndrew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the\r\nJews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the\r\ncontrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) 9:2 The\r\nJews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the\r\nprovinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their\r\nhurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon\r\nall people.\r\n\r\n9:3 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the\r\ndeputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear\r\nof Mordecai fell upon them.\r\n\r\n9:4 For Mordecai was great in the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and his fame went out\r\nthroughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n9:5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the\r\nsword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto\r\nthose that hated them.\r\n\r\n9:6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n9:7 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 9:8 And Poratha, and\r\nAdalia, and Aridatha, 9:9 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and\r\nVajezatha, 9:10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy\r\nof the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.\r\n\r\n9:11 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the\r\npalace was brought before the king.\r\n\r\n9:12 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and\r\ndestroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of\r\nHaman; what have they done in the rest of the king\xe2\x80\x99s provinces? now\r\nwhat is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy\r\nrequest further? and it shall be done.\r\n\r\n9:13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the\r\nJews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s decree, and let Haman\xe2\x80\x99s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.\r\n\r\n9:14 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given\r\nat Shushan; and they hanged Haman\xe2\x80\x99s ten sons.\r\n\r\n9:15 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on\r\nthe fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men\r\nat Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.\r\n\r\n9:16 But the other Jews that were in the king\xe2\x80\x99s provinces gathered\r\nthemselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from\r\ntheir enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but\r\nthey laid not their hands on the prey, 9:17 On the thirteenth day of\r\nthe month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and\r\nmade it a day of feasting and gladness.\r\n\r\n9:18 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the\r\nthirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the\r\nfifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting\r\nand gladness.\r\n\r\n9:19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled\r\ntowns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and\r\nfeasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.\r\n\r\n9:20 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the\r\nJews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh\r\nand far, 9:21 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the\r\nfourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same,\r\nyearly, 9:22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies,\r\nand the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from\r\nmourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting\r\nand joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n9:23 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai\r\nhad written unto them; 9:24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the\r\nAgagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to\r\ndestroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and\r\nto destroy them; 9:25 But when Esther came before the king, he\r\ncommanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against\r\nthe Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons\r\nshould be hanged on the gallows.\r\n\r\n9:26 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.\r\n\r\nTherefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had\r\nseen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, 9:27 The\r\nJews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all\r\nsuch as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that\r\nthey would keep these two days according to their writing, and\r\naccording to their appointed time every year; 9:28 And that these days\r\nshould be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every\r\nfamily, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim\r\nshould not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish\r\nfrom their seed.\r\n\r\n9:29 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the\r\nJew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.\r\n\r\n9:30 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty\r\nand seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace\r\nand truth, 9:31 To confirm these days of Purim in their times\r\nappointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had\r\nenjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their\r\nseed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.\r\n\r\n9:32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it\r\nwas written in the book.\r\n\r\n10:1 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the\r\nisles of the sea.\r\n\r\n10:2 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the\r\ndeclaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced\r\nhim, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings\r\nof Media and Persia?  10:3 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king\r\nAhasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of\r\nhis brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to\r\nall his seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Job\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that\r\nman was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.\r\n\r\n1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\n1:3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand\r\ncamels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and\r\na very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the\r\nmen of the east.\r\n\r\n1:4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;\r\nand sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,\r\nthat Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,\r\nand offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for\r\nJob said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their\r\nhearts. Thus did Job continually.\r\n\r\n1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present\r\nthemselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.\r\n\r\n1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan\r\nanswered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and\r\nfrom walking up and down in it.\r\n\r\n1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,\r\nthat there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright\r\nman, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  1:9 Then Satan\r\nanswered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  1:10 Hast\r\nnot thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all\r\nthat he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands,\r\nand his substance is increased in the land.\r\n\r\n1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he\r\nwill curse thee to thy face.\r\n\r\n1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy\r\npower; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth\r\nfrom the presence of the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating\r\nand drinking wine in their eldest brother\xe2\x80\x99s house: 1:14 And there came\r\na messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses\r\nfeeding beside them: 1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took\r\nthem away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the\r\nsword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\r\n\r\n1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The\r\nfire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and\r\nthe servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The\r\nChaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have\r\ncarried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the\r\nsword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\r\n\r\n1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy\r\nsons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s house: 1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the\r\nwilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon\r\nthe young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and\r\nfell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 1:21 And said, Naked came I\r\nout of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD\r\ngave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.\r\n\r\n2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present\r\nthemselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present\r\nhimself before the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan\r\nanswered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and\r\nfrom walking up and down in it.\r\n\r\n2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,\r\nthat there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright\r\nman, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth\r\nfast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy\r\nhim without cause.\r\n\r\n2:4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all\r\nthat a man hath will he give for his life.\r\n\r\n2:5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,\r\nand he will curse thee to thy face.\r\n\r\n2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but\r\nsave his life.\r\n\r\n2:7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job\r\nwith sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.\r\n\r\n2:8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat\r\ndown among the ashes.\r\n\r\n2:9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine\r\nintegrity?  curse God, and die.\r\n\r\n2:10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women\r\nspeaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we\r\nnot receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.\r\n\r\n2:11 Now when Job\xe2\x80\x99s three friends heard of all this evil that was come\r\nupon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the\r\nTemanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they\r\nhad made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to\r\ncomfort him.\r\n\r\n2:12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,\r\nthey lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his\r\nmantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.\r\n\r\n2:13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven\r\nnights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief\r\nwas very great.\r\n\r\n3:1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.\r\n\r\n3:2 And Job spake, and said, 3:3 Let the day perish wherein I was\r\nborn, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\n3:4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,\r\nneither let the light shine upon it.\r\n\r\n3:5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell\r\nupon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.\r\n\r\n3:6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be\r\njoined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of\r\nthe months.\r\n\r\n3:7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.\r\n\r\n3:8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up\r\ntheir mourning.\r\n\r\n3:9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for\r\nlight, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 3:10\r\nBecause it shut not up the doors of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb, nor hid sorrow\r\nfrom mine eyes.\r\n\r\n3:11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost\r\nwhen I came out of the belly?  3:12 Why did the knees prevent me? or\r\nwhy the breasts that I should suck?  3:13 For now should I have lain\r\nstill and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,\r\n3:14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate\r\nplaces for themselves; 3:15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled\r\ntheir houses with silver: 3:16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had\r\nnot been; as infants which never saw light.\r\n\r\n3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n3:18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the\r\noppressor.\r\n\r\n3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n3:20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto\r\nthe bitter in soul; 3:21 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and\r\ndig for it more than for hid treasures; 3:22 Which rejoice\r\nexceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?  3:23 Why is\r\nlight given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?\r\n3:24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured\r\nout like the waters.\r\n\r\n3:25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that\r\nwhich I was afraid of is come unto me.\r\n\r\n3:26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet\r\ntrouble came.\r\n\r\n4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 4:2 If we assay to\r\ncommune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself\r\nfrom speaking?  4:3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast\r\nstrengthened the weak hands.\r\n\r\n4:4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast\r\nstrengthened the feeble knees.\r\n\r\n4:5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,\r\nand thou art troubled.\r\n\r\n4:6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the\r\nuprightness of thy ways?  4:7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever\r\nperished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?  4:8\r\nEven as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n4:9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils\r\nare they consumed.\r\n\r\n4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and\r\nthe teeth of the young lions, are broken.\r\n\r\n4:11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhelps are scattered abroad.\r\n\r\n4:12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a\r\nlittle thereof.\r\n\r\n4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep\r\nfalleth on men, 4:14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all\r\nmy bones to shake.\r\n\r\n4:15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood\r\nup: 4:16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an\r\nimage was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice,\r\nsaying, 4:17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be\r\nmore pure than his maker?  4:18 Behold, he put no trust in his\r\nservants; and his angels he charged with folly: 4:19 How much less in\r\nthem that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust,\r\nwhich are crushed before the moth?  4:20 They are destroyed from\r\nmorning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.\r\n\r\n4:21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,\r\neven without wisdom.\r\n\r\n5:1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of\r\nthe saints wilt thou turn?  5:2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and\r\nenvy slayeth the silly one.\r\n\r\n5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\n5:4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the\r\ngate, neither is there any to deliver them.\r\n\r\n5:5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the\r\nthorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.\r\n\r\n5:6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth\r\ntrouble spring out of the ground; 5:7 Yet man is born unto trouble, as\r\nthe sparks fly upward.\r\n\r\n5:8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 5:9\r\nWhich doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without\r\nnumber: 5:10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon\r\nthe fields: 5:11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which\r\nmourn may be exalted to safety.\r\n\r\n5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands\r\ncannot perform their enterprise.\r\n\r\n5:13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of\r\nthe froward is carried headlong.\r\n\r\n5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday\r\nas in the night.\r\n\r\n5:15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from\r\nthe hand of the mighty.\r\n\r\n5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.\r\n\r\n5:17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise\r\nnot thou the chastening of the Almighty: 5:18 For he maketh sore, and\r\nbindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.\r\n\r\n5:19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall\r\nno evil touch thee.\r\n\r\n5:20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the\r\npower of the sword.\r\n\r\n5:21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt\r\nthou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.\r\n\r\n5:22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be\r\nafraid of the beasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n5:23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the\r\nbeasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.\r\n\r\n5:24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and\r\nthou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.\r\n\r\n5:25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine\r\noffspring as the grass of the earth.\r\n\r\n5:26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of\r\ncorn cometh in in his season.\r\n\r\n5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it\r\nfor thy good.\r\n\r\n6:1 But Job answered and said, 6:2 Oh that my grief were throughly\r\nweighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!  6:3 For now\r\nit would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are\r\nswallowed up.\r\n\r\n6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof\r\ndrinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n6:5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over\r\nhis fodder?  6:6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or\r\nis there any taste in the white of an egg?  6:7 The things that my\r\nsoul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.\r\n\r\n6:8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the\r\nthing that I long for!  6:9 Even that it would please God to destroy\r\nme; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!  6:10 Then\r\nshould I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let\r\nhim not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.\r\n\r\n6:11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,\r\nthat I should prolong my life?  6:12 Is my strength the strength of\r\nstones? or is my flesh of brass?  6:13 Is not my help in me? and is\r\nwisdom driven quite from me?  6:14 To him that is afflicted pity\r\nshould be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the\r\nAlmighty.\r\n\r\n6:15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream\r\nof brooks they pass away; 6:16 Which are blackish by reason of the\r\nice, and wherein the snow is hid: 6:17 What time they wax warm, they\r\nvanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.\r\n\r\n6:18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and\r\nperish.\r\n\r\n6:19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n6:20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither,\r\nand were ashamed.\r\n\r\n6:21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.\r\n\r\n6:22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your\r\nsubstance?  6:23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s hand? or, Redeem me\r\nfrom the hand of the mighty?  6:24 Teach me, and I will hold my\r\ntongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.\r\n\r\n6:25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?\r\n6:26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is\r\ndesperate, which are as wind?  6:27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless,\r\nand ye dig a pit for your friend.\r\n\r\n6:28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto\r\nyou if I lie.\r\n\r\n6:29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my\r\nrighteousness is in it.\r\n\r\n6:30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse\r\nthings?  7:1 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not\r\nhis days also like the days of an hireling?  7:2 As a servant\r\nearnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the\r\nreward of his work: 7:3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and\r\nwearisome nights are appointed to me.\r\n\r\n7:4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?\r\nand I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.\r\n\r\n7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is\r\nbroken, and become loathsome.\r\n\r\n7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s shuttle, and are spent without\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n7:7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.\r\n\r\n7:8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes\r\nare upon me, and I am not.\r\n\r\n7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down\r\nto the grave shall come up no more.\r\n\r\n7:10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place\r\nknow him any more.\r\n\r\n7:11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the\r\nanguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.\r\n\r\n7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?  7:13\r\nWhen I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my\r\ncomplaints; 7:14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me\r\nthrough visions: 7:15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death\r\nrather than my life.\r\n\r\n7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days\r\nare vanity.\r\n\r\n7:17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou\r\nshouldest set thine heart upon him?  7:18 And that thou shouldest\r\nvisit him every morning, and try him every moment?  7:19 How long wilt\r\nthou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my\r\nspittle?  7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou\r\npreserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so\r\nthat I am a burden to myself?  7:21 And why dost thou not pardon my\r\ntransgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the\r\ndust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.\r\n\r\n8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou\r\nspeak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like\r\na strong wind?  8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty\r\npervert justice?  8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he\r\nhave cast them away for their transgression; 8:5 If thou wouldest seek\r\nunto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 8:6 If\r\nthou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and\r\nmake the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.\r\n\r\n8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself\r\nto the search of their fathers: 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and\r\nknow nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 8:10 Shall\r\nnot they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their\r\nheart?  8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow\r\nwithout water?  8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut\r\ndown, it withereth before any other herb.\r\n\r\n8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite\xe2\x80\x99s hope\r\nshall perish: 8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall\r\nbe a spider\xe2\x80\x99s web.\r\n\r\n8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall\r\nhold it fast, but it shall not endure.\r\n\r\n8:16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying,\r\nI have not seen thee.\r\n\r\n8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall\r\nothers grow.\r\n\r\n8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he\r\nhelp the evil doers: 8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and\r\nthy lips with rejoicing.\r\n\r\n8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling\r\nplace of the wicked shall come to nought.\r\n\r\n9:1 Then Job answered and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but\r\nhow should man be just with God?  9:3 If he will contend with him, he\r\ncannot answer him one of a thousand.\r\n\r\n9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened\r\nhimself against him, and hath prospered?  9:5 Which removeth the\r\nmountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.\r\n\r\n9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\n9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders\r\nwithout number.\r\n\r\n9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I\r\nperceive him not.\r\n\r\n9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto\r\nhim, What doest thou?  9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the\r\nproud helpers do stoop under him.\r\n\r\n9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to\r\nreason with him?  9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not\r\nanswer, but I would make supplication to my judge.\r\n\r\n9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe\r\nthat he had hearkened unto my voice.\r\n\r\n9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds\r\nwithout cause.\r\n\r\n9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\n9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who\r\nshall set me a time to plead?  9:20 If I justify myself, mine own\r\nmouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me\r\nperverse.\r\n\r\n9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would\r\ndespise my life.\r\n\r\n9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect\r\nand the wicked.\r\n\r\n9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\n9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the\r\nfaces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?  9:25 Now\r\nmy days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.\r\n\r\n9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that\r\nhasteth to the prey.\r\n\r\n9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my\r\nheaviness, and comfort myself: 9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I\r\nknow that thou wilt not hold me innocent.\r\n\r\n9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?  9:30 If I wash myself\r\nwith snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 9:31 Yet shalt thou\r\nplunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.\r\n\r\n9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we\r\nshould come together in judgment.\r\n\r\n9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand\r\nupon us both.\r\n\r\n9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify\r\nme: 9:35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon\r\nmyself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.\r\n\r\n10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou\r\ncontendest with me.\r\n\r\n10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou\r\nshouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel\r\nof the wicked?  10:4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man\r\nseeth?  10:5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndays, 10:6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest\r\nafter my sin?  10:7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is\r\nnone that can deliver out of thine hand.\r\n\r\n10:8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;\r\nyet thou dost destroy me.\r\n\r\n10:9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and\r\nwilt thou bring me into dust again?  10:10 Hast thou not poured me out\r\nas milk, and curdled me like cheese?  10:11 Thou hast clothed me with\r\nskin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.\r\n\r\n10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath\r\npreserved my spirit.\r\n\r\n10:13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this\r\nis with thee.\r\n\r\n10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from\r\nmine iniquity.\r\n\r\n10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I\r\nnot lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine\r\naffliction; 10:16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:\r\nand again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.\r\n\r\n10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine\r\nindignation upon me; changes and war are against me.\r\n\r\n10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh\r\nthat I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  10:19 I should\r\nhave been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from\r\nthe womb to the grave.\r\n\r\n10:20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may\r\ntake comfort a little, 10:21 Before I go whence I shall not return,\r\neven to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 10:22 A land of\r\ndarkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any\r\norder, and where the light is as darkness.\r\n\r\n11:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2 Should not\r\nthe multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be\r\njustified?  11:3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when\r\nthou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?  11:4 For thou hast\r\nsaid, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.\r\n\r\n11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 11:6\r\nAnd that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are\r\ndouble to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less\r\nthan thine iniquity deserveth.\r\n\r\n11:7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the\r\nAlmighty unto perfection?  11:8 It is as high as heaven; what canst\r\nthou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?  11:9 The measure\r\nthereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.\r\n\r\n11:10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can\r\nhinder him?  11:11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also;\r\nwill he not then consider it?  11:12 For vain men would be wise,\r\nthough man be born like a wild ass\xe2\x80\x99s colt.\r\n\r\n11:13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward\r\nhim; 11:14 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not\r\nwickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.\r\n\r\n11:15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou\r\nshalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 11:16 Because thou shalt forget\r\nthy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: 11:17 And thine\r\nage shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou\r\nshalt be as the morning.\r\n\r\n11:18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt\r\ndig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.\r\n\r\n11:19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea,\r\nmany shall make suit unto thee.\r\n\r\n11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not\r\nescape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.\r\n\r\n12:1 And Job answered and said, 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people,\r\nand wisdom shall die with you.\r\n\r\n12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to\r\nyou: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?  12:4 I am as one\r\nmocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:\r\nthe just upright man is laughed to scorn.\r\n\r\n12:5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in\r\nthe thought of him that is at ease.\r\n\r\n12:6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are\r\nsecure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.\r\n\r\n12:7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls\r\nof the air, and they shall tell thee: 12:8 Or speak to the earth, and\r\nit shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath\r\nwrought this?  12:10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,\r\nand the breath of all mankind.\r\n\r\n12:11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?  12:12\r\nWith the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.\r\n\r\n12:13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n12:14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he\r\nshutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.\r\n\r\n12:15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he\r\nsendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.\r\n\r\n12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver\r\nare his.\r\n\r\n12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges\r\nfools.\r\n\r\n12:18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\n12:19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.\r\n\r\n12:20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the\r\nunderstanding of the aged.\r\n\r\n12:21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of\r\nthe mighty.\r\n\r\n12:22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to\r\nlight the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the\r\nnations, and straiteneth them again.\r\n\r\n12:24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the\r\nearth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no\r\nway.\r\n\r\n12:25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to\r\nstagger like a drunken man.\r\n\r\n13:1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and\r\nunderstood it.\r\n\r\n13:2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n13:3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n13:4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.\r\n\r\n13:5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.\r\n\r\n13:7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?\r\n13:8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?  13:9 Is it\r\ngood that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do\r\nye so mock him?  13:10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly\r\naccept persons.\r\n\r\n13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall\r\nupon you?  13:12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to\r\nbodies of clay.\r\n\r\n13:13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on\r\nme what will.\r\n\r\n13:14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in\r\nmine hand?  13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I\r\nwill maintain mine own ways before him.\r\n\r\n13:16 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n13:17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.\r\n\r\n13:18 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n13:19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue,\r\nI shall give up the ghost.\r\n\r\n13:20 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n13:21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n13:22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer\r\nthou me.\r\n\r\n13:23 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my\r\ntransgression and my sin.\r\n\r\n13:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?\r\n13:25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue\r\nthe dry stubble?  13:26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and\r\nmakest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.\r\n\r\n13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly\r\nunto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.\r\n\r\n13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.\r\n\r\n14:2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as\r\na shadow, and continueth not.\r\n\r\n14:3 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me\r\ninto judgment with thee?  14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an\r\nunclean? not one.\r\n\r\n14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with\r\nthee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 14:6 Turn\r\nfrom him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling,\r\nhis day.\r\n\r\n14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will\r\nsprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.\r\n\r\n14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock\r\nthereof die in the ground; 14:9 Yet through the scent of water it will\r\nbud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.\r\n\r\n14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,\r\nand where is he?  14:11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood\r\ndecayeth and drieth up: 14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till\r\nthe heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of\r\ntheir sleep.\r\n\r\n14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest\r\nkeep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me\r\na set time, and remember me!  14:14 If a man die, shall he live again?\r\nall the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\r\n\r\n14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire\r\nto the work of thine hands.\r\n\r\n14:16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my\r\nsin?  14:17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up\r\nmine iniquity.\r\n\r\n14:18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock\r\nis removed out of his place.\r\n\r\n14:19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which\r\ngrow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n14:20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou\r\nchangest his countenance, and sendest him away.\r\n\r\n14:21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are\r\nbrought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.\r\n\r\n14:22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him\r\nshall mourn.\r\n\r\n15:1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 15:2 Should a wise\r\nman utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?  15:3\r\nShould he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he\r\ncan do no good?  15:4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest\r\nprayer before God.\r\n\r\n15:5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the\r\ntongue of the crafty.\r\n\r\n15:6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips\r\ntestify against thee.\r\n\r\n15:7 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before\r\nthe hills?  15:8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou\r\nrestrain wisdom to thyself?  15:9 What knowest thou, that we know not?\r\nwhat understandest thou, which is not in us?  15:10 With us are both\r\nthe grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.\r\n\r\n15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret\r\nthing with thee?  15:12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what\r\ndo thy eyes wink at, 15:13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God,\r\nand lettest such words go out of thy mouth?  15:14 What is man, that\r\nhe should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be\r\nrighteous?  15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the\r\nheavens are not clean in his sight.\r\n\r\n15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh\r\niniquity like water?  15:17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which\r\nI have seen I will declare; 15:18 Which wise men have told from their\r\nfathers, and have not hid it: 15:19 Unto whom alone the earth was\r\ngiven, and no stranger passed among them.\r\n\r\n15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number\r\nof years is hidden to the oppressor.\r\n\r\n15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer\r\nshall come upon him.\r\n\r\n15:22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is\r\nwaited for of the sword.\r\n\r\n15:23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth\r\nthat the day of darkness is ready at his hand.\r\n\r\n15:24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail\r\nagainst him, as a king ready to the battle.\r\n\r\n15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth\r\nhimself against the Almighty.\r\n\r\n15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of\r\nhis bucklers: 15:27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and\r\nmaketh collops of fat on his flanks.\r\n\r\n15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man\r\ninhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.\r\n\r\n15:29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,\r\nneither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.\r\n\r\n15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his\r\nbranches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.\r\n\r\n15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall\r\nbe his recompence.\r\n\r\n15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall\r\nnot be green.\r\n\r\n15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast\r\noff his flower as the olive.\r\n\r\n15:34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire\r\nshall consume the tabernacles of bribery.\r\n\r\n15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly\r\nprepareth deceit.\r\n\r\n16:1 Then Job answered and said, 16:2 I have heard many such things:\r\nmiserable comforters are ye all.\r\n\r\n16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou\r\nanswerest?  16:4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x99s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head\r\nat you.\r\n\r\n16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my\r\nlips should asswage your grief.\r\n\r\n16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,\r\nwhat am I eased?  16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made\r\ndesolate all my company.\r\n\r\n16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against\r\nme: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.\r\n\r\n16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me\r\nwith his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.\r\n\r\n16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me\r\nupon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into\r\nthe hands of the wicked.\r\n\r\n16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken\r\nme by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.\r\n\r\n16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins\r\nasunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.\r\n\r\n16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like\r\na giant.\r\n\r\n16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of\r\ndeath; 16:17 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is\r\npure.\r\n\r\n16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.\r\n\r\n16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.\r\n\r\n16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for\r\nhis neighbour!  16:22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the\r\nway whence I shall not return.\r\n\r\n17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n17:2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in\r\ntheir provocation?  17:3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee;\r\nwho is he that will strike hands with me?  17:4 For thou hast hid\r\ntheir heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.\r\n\r\n17:5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his\r\nchildren shall fail.\r\n\r\n17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was\r\nas a tabret.\r\n\r\n17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are\r\nas a shadow.\r\n\r\n17:8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall\r\nstir up himself against the hypocrite.\r\n\r\n17:9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean\r\nhands shall be stronger and stronger.\r\n\r\n17:10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot\r\nfind one wise man among you.\r\n\r\n17:11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts\r\nof my heart.\r\n\r\n17:12 They change the night into day: the light is short because of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n17:13 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou\r\nart my mother, and my sister.\r\n\r\n17:15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?\r\n17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest\r\ntogether is in the dust.\r\n\r\n18:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 18:2 How long will it\r\nbe ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.\r\n\r\n18:3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your\r\nsight?  18:4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be\r\nforsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?\r\n18:5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of\r\nhis fire shall not shine.\r\n\r\n18:6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall\r\nbe put out with him.\r\n\r\n18:7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own\r\ncounsel shall cast him down.\r\n\r\n18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a\r\nsnare.\r\n\r\n18:9 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n18:10 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n18:12 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be\r\nready at his side.\r\n\r\n18:13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of\r\ndeath shall devour his strength.\r\n\r\n18:14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it\r\nshall bring him to the king of terrors.\r\n\r\n18:15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:\r\nbrimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.\r\n\r\n18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch\r\nbe cut off.\r\n\r\n18:17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have\r\nno name in the street.\r\n\r\n18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n18:19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any\r\nremaining in his dwellings.\r\n\r\n18:20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they\r\nthat went before were affrighted.\r\n\r\n18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the\r\nplace of him that knoweth not God.\r\n\r\n19:1 Then Job answered and said, 19:2 How long will ye vex my soul,\r\nand break me in pieces with words?  19:3 These ten times have ye\r\nreproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n19:4 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n19:5 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead\r\nagainst me my reproach: 19:6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and\r\nhath compassed me with his net.\r\n\r\n19:7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but\r\nthere is no judgment.\r\n\r\n19:8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set\r\ndarkness in my paths.\r\n\r\n19:9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n19:10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope\r\nhath he removed like a tree.\r\n\r\n19:11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me\r\nunto him as one of his enemies.\r\n\r\n19:12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and\r\nencamp round about my tabernacle.\r\n\r\n19:13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are\r\nverily estranged from me.\r\n\r\n19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten\r\nme.\r\n\r\n19:15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a\r\nstranger: I am an alien in their sight.\r\n\r\n19:16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him\r\nwith my mouth.\r\n\r\n19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s sake of mine own body.\r\n\r\n19:18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against\r\nme.\r\n\r\n19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are\r\nturned against me.\r\n\r\n19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped\r\nwith the skin of my teeth.\r\n\r\n19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the\r\nhand of God hath touched me.\r\n\r\n19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my\r\nflesh?  19:23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were\r\nprinted in a book!  19:24 That they were graven with an iron pen and\r\nlead in the rock for ever!  19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth,\r\nand that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 19:26 And\r\nthough after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I\r\nsee God: 19:27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall\r\nbehold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.\r\n\r\n19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the\r\nmatter is found in me?  19:29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath\r\nbringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n20:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2 Therefore do\r\nmy thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.\r\n\r\n20:3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my\r\nunderstanding causeth me to answer.\r\n\r\n20:4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,\r\n20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the\r\nhypocrite but for a moment?  20:6 Though his excellency mount up to\r\nthe heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 20:7 Yet he shall\r\nperish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say,\r\nWhere is he?  20:8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be\r\nfound: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.\r\n\r\n20:9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall\r\nhis place any more behold him.\r\n\r\n20:10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall\r\nrestore their goods.\r\n\r\n20:11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down\r\nwith him in the dust.\r\n\r\n20:12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under\r\nhis tongue; 20:13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it\r\nstill within his mouth: 20:14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it\r\nis the gall of asps within him.\r\n\r\n20:15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:\r\nGod shall cast them out of his belly.\r\n\r\n20:16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper\xe2\x80\x99s tongue shall slay\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n20:17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n20:18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not\r\nswallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be,\r\nand he shall not rejoice therein.\r\n\r\n20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he\r\nhath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 20:20 Surely\r\nhe shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that\r\nwhich he desired.\r\n\r\n20:21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man\r\nlook for his goods.\r\n\r\n20:22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every\r\nhand of the wicked shall come upon him.\r\n\r\n20:23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of\r\nhis wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.\r\n\r\n20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall\r\nstrike him through.\r\n\r\n20:25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering\r\nsword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.\r\n\r\n20:26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown\r\nshall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his\r\ntabernacle.\r\n\r\n20:27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise\r\nup against him.\r\n\r\n20:28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow\r\naway in the day of his wrath.\r\n\r\n20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage\r\nappointed unto him by God.\r\n\r\n21:1 But Job answered and said, 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and\r\nlet this be your consolations.\r\n\r\n21:3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock\r\non.\r\n\r\n21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should\r\nnot my spirit be troubled?  21:5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay\r\nyour hand upon your mouth.\r\n\r\n21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in\r\npower?  21:8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and\r\ntheir offspring before their eyes.\r\n\r\n21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and\r\ncasteth not her calf.\r\n\r\n21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their\r\nchildren dance.\r\n\r\n21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n21:13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n21:14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not\r\nthe knowledge of thy ways.\r\n\r\n21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit\r\nshould we have, if we pray unto him?  21:16 Lo, their good is not in\r\ntheir hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.\r\n\r\n21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh\r\ntheir destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.\r\n\r\n21:18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm\r\ncarrieth away.\r\n\r\n21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,\r\nand he shall know it.\r\n\r\n21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the\r\nwrath of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the\r\nnumber of his months is cut off in the midst?  21:22 Shall any teach\r\nGod knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.\r\n\r\n21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.\r\n\r\n21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with\r\nmarrow.\r\n\r\n21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never\r\neateth with pleasure.\r\n\r\n21:26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n21:27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye\r\nwrongfully imagine against me.\r\n\r\n21:28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the\r\ndwelling places of the wicked?  21:29 Have ye not asked them that go\r\nby the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 21:30 That the wicked is\r\nreserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the\r\nday of wrath.\r\n\r\n21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him\r\nwhat he hath done?  21:32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and\r\nshall remain in the tomb.\r\n\r\n21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man\r\nshall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.\r\n\r\n21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there\r\nremaineth falsehood?  22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and\r\nsaid, 22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be\r\nprofitable unto himself?  22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty,\r\nthat thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy\r\nways perfect?  22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he\r\nenter with thee into judgment?  22:5 Is not thy wickedness great? and\r\nthine iniquities infinite?  22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy\r\nbrother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.\r\n\r\n22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast\r\nwithholden bread from the hungry.\r\n\r\n22:8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable\r\nman dwelt in it.\r\n\r\n22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless\r\nhave been broken.\r\n\r\n22:10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth\r\nthee; 22:11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of\r\nwaters cover thee.\r\n\r\n22:12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the\r\nstars, how high they are!  22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know?\r\ncan he judge through the dark cloud?  22:14 Thick clouds are a\r\ncovering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?\r\n22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown\r\nwith a flood: 22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can\r\nthe Almighty do for them?  22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good\r\nthings: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.\r\n\r\n22:19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them\r\nto scorn.\r\n\r\n22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them\r\nthe fire consumeth.\r\n\r\n22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good\r\nshall come unto thee.\r\n\r\n22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his\r\nwords in thine heart.\r\n\r\n22:23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou\r\nshalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.\r\n\r\n22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as\r\nthe stones of the brooks.\r\n\r\n22:25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have\r\nplenty of silver.\r\n\r\n22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt\r\nlift up thy face unto God.\r\n\r\n22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and\r\nthou shalt pay thy vows.\r\n\r\n22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto\r\nthee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.\r\n\r\n22:29 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting\r\nup; and he shall save the humble person.\r\n\r\n22:30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered\r\nby the pureness of thine hands.\r\n\r\n23:1 Then Job answered and said, 23:2 Even to day is my complaint\r\nbitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.\r\n\r\n23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to\r\nhis seat!  23:4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth\r\nwith arguments.\r\n\r\n23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand\r\nwhat he would say unto me.\r\n\r\n23:6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would\r\nput strength in me.\r\n\r\n23:7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be\r\ndelivered for ever from my judge.\r\n\r\n23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I\r\ncannot perceive him: 23:9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I\r\ncannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot\r\nsee him: 23:10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried\r\nme, I shall come forth as gold.\r\n\r\n23:11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\n23:12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I\r\nhave esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.\r\n\r\n23:13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul\r\ndesireth, even that he doeth.\r\n\r\n23:14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many\r\nsuch things are with him.\r\n\r\n23:15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am\r\nafraid of him.\r\n\r\n23:16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:\r\n23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he\r\ncovered the darkness from my face.\r\n\r\n24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that\r\nknow him not see his days?  24:2 Some remove the landmarks; they\r\nviolently take away flocks, and feed thereof.\r\n\r\n24:3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nox for a pledge.\r\n\r\n24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide\r\nthemselves together.\r\n\r\n24:5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;\r\nrising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and\r\nfor their children.\r\n\r\n24:6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the\r\nvintage of the wicked.\r\n\r\n24:7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no\r\ncovering in the cold.\r\n\r\n24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the\r\nrock for want of a shelter.\r\n\r\n24:9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\n24:10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away\r\nthe sheaf from the hungry; 24:11 Which make oil within their walls,\r\nand tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.\r\n\r\n24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded\r\ncrieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.\r\n\r\n24:13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not\r\nthe ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.\r\n\r\n24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,\r\nand in the night is as a thief.\r\n\r\n24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,\r\nNo eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.\r\n\r\n24:16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for\r\nthemselves in the daytime: they know not the light.\r\n\r\n24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one\r\nknow them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n24:18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth:\r\nhe beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.\r\n\r\n24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave\r\nthose which have sinned.\r\n\r\n24:20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;\r\nhe shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not\r\ngood to the widow.\r\n\r\n24:22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no\r\nman is sure of life.\r\n\r\n24:23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet\r\nhis eyes are upon their ways.\r\n\r\n24:24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought\r\nlow; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the\r\ntops of the ears of corn.\r\n\r\n24:25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my\r\nspeech nothing worth?  25:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and\r\nsaid, 25:2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n25:3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his\r\nlight arise?  25:4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can\r\nhe be clean that is born of a woman?  25:5 Behold even to the moon,\r\nand it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.\r\n\r\n25:6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a\r\nworm?  26:1 But Job answered and said, 26:2 How hast thou helped him\r\nthat is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?\r\n26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast\r\nthou plentifully declared the thing as it is?  26:4 To whom hast thou\r\nuttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?  26:5 Dead things are\r\nformed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.\r\n\r\n26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the\r\nearth upon nothing.\r\n\r\n26:8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is\r\nnot rent under them.\r\n\r\n26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and\r\nnight come to an end.\r\n\r\n26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.\r\n\r\n26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he\r\nsmiteth through the proud.\r\n\r\n26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath\r\nformed the crooked serpent.\r\n\r\n26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is\r\nheard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?  27:1\r\nMoreover Job continued his parable, and said, 27:2 As God liveth, who\r\nhath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;\r\n27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my\r\nnostrils; 27:4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter\r\ndeceit.\r\n\r\n27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not\r\nremove mine integrity from me.\r\n\r\n27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart\r\nshall not reproach me so long as I live.\r\n\r\n27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me\r\nas the unrighteous.\r\n\r\n27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,\r\nwhen God taketh away his soul?  27:9 Will God hear his cry when\r\ntrouble cometh upon him?  27:10 Will he delight himself in the\r\nAlmighty? will he always call upon God?  27:11 I will teach you by the\r\nhand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.\r\n\r\n27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus\r\naltogether vain?  27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God,\r\nand the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the\r\nAlmighty.\r\n\r\n27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his\r\noffspring shall not be satisfied with bread.\r\n\r\n27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his\r\nwidows shall not weep.\r\n\r\n27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the\r\nclay; 27:17 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the\r\ninnocent shall divide the silver.\r\n\r\n27:18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper\r\nmaketh.\r\n\r\n27:19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he\r\nopeneth his eyes, and he is not.\r\n\r\n27:20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away\r\nin the night.\r\n\r\n27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a\r\nstorm hurleth him out of his place.\r\n\r\n27:22 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee\r\nout of his hand.\r\n\r\n27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n28:1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where\r\nthey fine it.\r\n\r\n28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n28:3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection:\r\nthe stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters\r\nforgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.\r\n\r\n28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned\r\nup as it were fire.\r\n\r\n28:6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n28:7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye hath not seen: 28:8 The lion\xe2\x80\x99s whelps have not trodden it, nor the\r\nfierce lion passed by it.\r\n\r\n28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the\r\nmountains by the roots.\r\n\r\n28:10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every\r\nprecious thing.\r\n\r\n28:11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is\r\nhid bringeth he forth to light.\r\n\r\n28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of\r\nunderstanding?  28:13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it\r\nfound in the land of the living.\r\n\r\n28:14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed\r\nfor the price thereof.\r\n\r\n28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious\r\nonyx, or the sapphire.\r\n\r\n28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it\r\nshall not be for jewels of fine gold.\r\n\r\n28:18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price\r\nof wisdom is above rubies.\r\n\r\n28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be\r\nvalued with pure gold.\r\n\r\n28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of\r\nunderstanding?  28:21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,\r\nand kept close from the fowls of the air.\r\n\r\n28:22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with\r\nour ears.\r\n\r\n28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n28:24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the\r\nwhole heaven; 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth\r\nthe waters by measure.\r\n\r\n28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning\r\nof the thunder: 28:27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared\r\nit, yea, and searched it out.\r\n\r\n28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is\r\nwisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\r\n\r\n29:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2 Oh that I were\r\nas in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 29:3 When his\r\ncandle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through\r\ndarkness; 29:4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of\r\nGod was upon my tabernacle; 29:5 When the Almighty was yet with me,\r\nwhen my children were about me; 29:6 When I washed my steps with\r\nbutter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 29:7 When I went out\r\nto the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!\r\n29:8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and\r\nstood up.\r\n\r\n29:9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n29:10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the\r\nroof of their mouth.\r\n\r\n29:11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw\r\nme, it gave witness to me: 29:12 Because I delivered the poor that\r\ncried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.\r\n\r\n29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I\r\ncaused the widow\xe2\x80\x99s heart to sing for joy.\r\n\r\n29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a\r\nrobe and a diadem.\r\n\r\n29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.\r\n\r\n29:16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I\r\nsearched out.\r\n\r\n29:17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n29:18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my\r\ndays as the sand.\r\n\r\n29:19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night\r\nupon my branch.\r\n\r\n29:20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.\r\n\r\n29:21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n29:22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n29:23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their\r\nmouth wide as for the latter rain.\r\n\r\n29:24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my\r\ncountenance they cast not down.\r\n\r\n29:25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the\r\narmy, as one that comforteth the mourners.\r\n\r\n30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose\r\nfathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.\r\n\r\n30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom\r\nold age was perished?  30:3 For want and famine they were solitary;\r\nfleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.\r\n\r\n30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n30:5 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as\r\nafter a thief;) 30:6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves\r\nof the earth, and in the rocks.\r\n\r\n30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were\r\ngathered together.\r\n\r\n30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were\r\nviler than the earth.\r\n\r\n30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.\r\n\r\n30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in\r\nmy face.\r\n\r\n30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also\r\nlet loose the bridle before me.\r\n\r\n30:12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and\r\nthey raise up against me the ways of their destruction.\r\n\r\n30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no\r\nhelper.\r\n\r\n30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the\r\ndesolation they rolled themselves upon me.\r\n\r\n30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and\r\nmy welfare passeth away as a cloud.\r\n\r\n30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction\r\nhave taken hold upon me.\r\n\r\n30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews\r\ntake no rest.\r\n\r\n30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it\r\nbindeth me about as the collar of my coat.\r\n\r\n30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou\r\nregardest me not.\r\n\r\n30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest\r\nthyself against me.\r\n\r\n30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,\r\nand dissolvest my substance.\r\n\r\n30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house\r\nappointed for all living.\r\n\r\n30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though\r\nthey cry in his destruction.\r\n\r\n30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul\r\ngrieved for the poor?  30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came\r\nunto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.\r\n\r\n30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction\r\nprevented me.\r\n\r\n30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.\r\n\r\n30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.\r\n\r\n30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice\r\nof them that weep.\r\n\r\n31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a\r\nmaid?  31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what\r\ninheritance of the Almighty from on high?  31:3 Is not destruction to\r\nthe wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?  31:4\r\nDoth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?  31:5 If I have\r\nwalked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 31:6 Let me\r\nbe weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.\r\n\r\n31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked\r\nafter mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 31:8 Then\r\nlet me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.\r\n\r\n31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid\r\nwait at my neighbours door; 31:10 Then let my wife grind unto\r\nanother, and let others bow down upon her.\r\n\r\n31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be\r\npunished by the judges.\r\n\r\n31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root\r\nout all mine increase.\r\n\r\n31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my\r\nmaidservant, when they contended with me; 31:14 What then shall I do\r\nwhen God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?\r\n31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one\r\nfashion us in the womb?  31:16 If I have withheld the poor from their\r\ndesire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 31:17 Or have\r\neaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten\r\nthereof; 31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a\r\nfather, and I have guided her from my mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb;) 31:19 If I have\r\nseen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;\r\n31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with\r\nthe fleece of my sheep; 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the\r\nfatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 31:22 Then let mine arm\r\nfall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.\r\n\r\n31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of\r\nhis highness I could not endure.\r\n\r\n31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou\r\nart my confidence; 31:25 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and\r\nbecause mine hand had gotten much; 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it\r\nshined, or the moon walking in brightness; 31:27 And my heart hath\r\nbeen secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 31:28 This\r\nalso were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have\r\ndenied the God that is above.\r\n\r\n31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted\r\nup myself when evil found him: 31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth\r\nto sin by wishing a curse to his soul.\r\n\r\n31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his\r\nflesh!  we cannot be satisfied.\r\n\r\n31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors\r\nto the traveller.\r\n\r\n31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity\r\nin my bosom: 31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt\r\nof families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the\r\ndoor?  31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the\r\nAlmighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.\r\n\r\n31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince\r\nwould I go near unto him.\r\n\r\n31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof\r\ncomplain; 31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or\r\nhave caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 31:40 Let thistles\r\ngrow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.\r\n\r\nThe words of Job are ended.\r\n\r\n32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous\r\nin his own eyes.\r\n\r\n32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the\r\nBuzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled,\r\nbecause he justified himself rather than God.\r\n\r\n32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because\r\nthey had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.\r\n\r\n32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder\r\nthan he.\r\n\r\n32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these\r\nthree men, then his wrath was kindled.\r\n\r\n32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am\r\nyoung, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew\r\nyou mine opinion.\r\n\r\n32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty\r\ngiveth them understanding.\r\n\r\n32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.\r\n\r\n32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,\r\nwhilst ye searched out what to say.\r\n\r\n32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you\r\nthat convinced Job, or that answered his words: 32:13 Lest ye should\r\nsay, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.\r\n\r\n32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I\r\nanswer him with your speeches.\r\n\r\n32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.\r\n\r\n32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and\r\nanswered no more;) 32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also\r\nwill shew mine opinion.\r\n\r\n32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.\r\n\r\n32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to\r\nburst like new bottles.\r\n\r\n32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man\xe2\x80\x99s person, neither let me\r\ngive flattering titles unto man.\r\n\r\n32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker\r\nwould soon take me away.\r\n\r\n33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all\r\nmy words.\r\n\r\n33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips\r\nshall utter knowledge clearly.\r\n\r\n33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\r\nhath given me life.\r\n\r\n33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand\r\nup.\r\n\r\n33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God\xe2\x80\x99s stead: I also am\r\nformed out of the clay.\r\n\r\n33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my\r\nhand be heavy upon thee.\r\n\r\n33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the\r\nvoice of thy words, saying, 33:9 I am clean without transgression, I\r\nam innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.\r\n\r\n33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his\r\nenemy, 33:11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my\r\npaths.\r\n\r\n33:12 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God\r\nis greater than man.\r\n\r\n33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of\r\nany of his matters.\r\n\r\n33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.\r\n\r\n33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth\r\nupon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 33:16 Then he openeth the ears\r\nof men, and sealeth their instruction, 33:17 That he may withdraw man\r\nfrom his purpose, and hide pride from man.\r\n\r\n33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from\r\nperishing by the sword.\r\n\r\n33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude\r\nof his bones with strong pain: 33:20 So that his life abhorreth bread,\r\nand his soul dainty meat.\r\n\r\n33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his\r\nbones that were not seen stick out.\r\n\r\n33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the\r\ndestroyers.\r\n\r\n33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a\r\nthousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 33:24 Then he is gracious\r\nunto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have\r\nfound a ransom.\r\n\r\n33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child\xe2\x80\x99s: he shall return to\r\nthe days of his youth: 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be\r\nfavourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will\r\nrender unto man his righteousness.\r\n\r\n33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and\r\nperverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 33:28 He will\r\ndeliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n33:29 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To\r\nbring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of\r\nthe living.\r\n\r\n33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n33:32 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to\r\njustify thee.\r\n\r\n33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 34:2 Hear my words, O ye\r\nwise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.\r\n\r\n34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.\r\n\r\n34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without\r\ntransgression.\r\n\r\n34:7 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?  34:8\r\nWhich goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with\r\nwicked men.\r\n\r\n34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should\r\ndelight himself with God.\r\n\r\n34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it\r\nfrom God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he\r\nshould commit iniquity.\r\n\r\n34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every\r\nman to find according to his ways.\r\n\r\n34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty\r\npervert judgment.\r\n\r\n34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed\r\nthe whole world?  34:14 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather\r\nunto himself his spirit and his breath; 34:15 All flesh shall perish\r\ntogether, and man shall turn again unto dust.\r\n\r\n34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice\r\nof my words.\r\n\r\n34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn\r\nhim that is most just?  34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art\r\nwicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?  34:19 How much less to him\r\nthat accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more\r\nthan the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.\r\n\r\n34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at\r\nmidnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his\r\ngoings.\r\n\r\n34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of\r\niniquity may hide themselves.\r\n\r\n34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should\r\nenter into judgment with God.\r\n\r\n34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set\r\nothers in their stead.\r\n\r\n34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the\r\nnight, so that they are destroyed.\r\n\r\n34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;\r\n34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of\r\nhis ways: 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto\r\nhim, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.\r\n\r\n34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he\r\nhideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a\r\nnation, or against a man only: 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not,\r\nlest the people be ensnared.\r\n\r\n34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne\r\nchastisement, I will not offend any more: 34:32 That which I see not\r\nteach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.\r\n\r\n34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,\r\nwhether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore\r\nspeak what thou knowest.\r\n\r\n34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken\r\nunto me.\r\n\r\n34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his\r\nanswers for wicked men.\r\n\r\n34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands\r\namong us, and multiplieth his words against God.\r\n\r\n35:1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be\r\nright, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God\xe2\x80\x99s?  35:3\r\nFor thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit\r\nshall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?  35:4 I will answer thee,\r\nand thy companions with thee.\r\n\r\n35:5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are\r\nhigher than thou.\r\n\r\n35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy\r\ntransgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?  35:7 If thou\r\nbe righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine\r\nhand?  35:8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy\r\nrighteousness may profit the son of man.\r\n\r\n35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed\r\nto cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.\r\n\r\n35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the\r\nnight; 35:11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and\r\nmaketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?  35:12 There they cry, but\r\nnone giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.\r\n\r\n35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty\r\nregard it.\r\n\r\n35:14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is\r\nbefore him; therefore trust thou in him.\r\n\r\n35:15 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet\r\nhe knoweth it not in great extremity: 35:16 Therefore doth Job open\r\nhis mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.\r\n\r\n36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I\r\nwill shew thee that I have yet to speak on God\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.\r\n\r\n36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe\r\nrighteousness to my Maker.\r\n\r\n36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in\r\nknowledge is with thee.\r\n\r\n36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in\r\nstrength and wisdom.\r\n\r\n36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings\r\nare they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they\r\nare exalted.\r\n\r\n36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of\r\naffliction; 36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their\r\ntransgressions that they have exceeded.\r\n\r\n36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that\r\nthey return from iniquity.\r\n\r\n36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in\r\nprosperity, and their years in pleasures.\r\n\r\n36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they\r\nshall die without knowledge.\r\n\r\n36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he\r\nbindeth them.\r\n\r\n36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.\r\n\r\n36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears\r\nin oppression.\r\n\r\n36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a\r\nbroad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be\r\nset on thy table should be full of fatness.\r\n\r\n36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and\r\njustice take hold on thee.\r\n\r\n36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his\r\nstroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.\r\n\r\n36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.\r\n\r\n36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather\r\nthan affliction.\r\n\r\n36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?  36:23\r\nWho hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought\r\niniquity?  36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\n36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.\r\n\r\n36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the\r\nnumber of his years be searched out.\r\n\r\n36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain\r\naccording to the vapour thereof: 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and\r\ndistil upon man abundantly.\r\n\r\n36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the\r\nnoise of his tabernacle?  36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon\r\nit, and covereth the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.\r\n\r\n36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to\r\nshine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.\r\n\r\n36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also\r\nconcerning the vapour.\r\n\r\n37:1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.\r\n\r\n37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth\r\nout of his mouth.\r\n\r\n37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto\r\nthe ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his\r\nexcellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.\r\n\r\n37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth\r\nhe, which we cannot comprehend.\r\n\r\n37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the\r\nsmall rain, and to the great rain of his strength.\r\n\r\n37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.\r\n\r\n37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.\r\n\r\n37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the\r\nwaters is straitened.\r\n\r\n37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his\r\nbright cloud: 37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that\r\nthey may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world\r\nin the earth.\r\n\r\n37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,\r\nor for mercy.\r\n\r\n37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous\r\nworks of God.\r\n\r\n37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of\r\nhis cloud to shine?  37:16 Dost thou know the balancings of the\r\nclouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?\r\n37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the\r\nsouth wind?  37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is\r\nstrong, and as a molten looking glass?  37:19 Teach us what we shall\r\nsay unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.\r\n\r\n37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he\r\nshall be swallowed up.\r\n\r\n37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but\r\nthe wind passeth, and cleanseth them.\r\n\r\n37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\n37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent\r\nin power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not\r\nafflict.\r\n\r\n37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise\r\nof heart.\r\n\r\n38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2\r\nWho is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?  38:3\r\nGird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and\r\nanswer thou me.\r\n\r\n38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?\r\ndeclare, if thou hast understanding.\r\n\r\n38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath\r\nstretched the line upon it?  38:6 Whereupon are the foundations\r\nthereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 38:7 When the\r\nmorning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\r\n38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it\r\nhad issued out of the womb?  38:9 When I made the cloud the garment\r\nthereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 38:10 And brake up\r\nfor it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, 38:11 And said,\r\nHitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud\r\nwaves be stayed?  38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy\r\ndays; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 38:13 That it might\r\ntake hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken\r\nout of it?  38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as\r\na garment.\r\n\r\n38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm\r\nshall be broken.\r\n\r\n38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou\r\nwalked in the search of the depth?  38:17 Have the gates of death been\r\nopened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?\r\n38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou\r\nknowest it all.\r\n\r\n38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,\r\nwhere is the place thereof, 38:20 That thou shouldest take it to the\r\nbound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house\r\nthereof?  38:21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or\r\nbecause the number of thy days is great?  38:22 Hast thou entered into\r\nthe treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the\r\nhail, 38:23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against\r\nthe day of battle and war?  38:24 By what way is the light parted,\r\nwhich scattereth the east wind upon the earth?  38:25 Who hath divided\r\na watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the\r\nlightning of thunder; 38:26 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no\r\nman is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 38:27 To satisfy\r\nthe desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb\r\nto spring forth?  38:28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten\r\nthe drops of dew?  38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary\r\nfrost of heaven, who hath gendered it?  38:30 The waters are hid as\r\nwith a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.\r\n\r\n38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the\r\nbands of Orion?  38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?\r\nor canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?  38:33 Knowest thou the\r\nordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the\r\nearth?  38:34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that\r\nabundance of waters may cover thee?  38:35 Canst thou send lightnings,\r\nthat they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?  38:36 Who hath put\r\nwisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the\r\nheart?  38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the\r\nbottles of heaven, 38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the\r\nclods cleave fast together?  38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the\r\nlion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 38:40 When they couch\r\nin their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?  38:41 Who\r\nprovideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God,\r\nthey wander for lack of meat.\r\n\r\n39:1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring\r\nforth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?  39:2 Canst thou\r\nnumber the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they\r\nbring forth?  39:3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young\r\nones, they cast out their sorrows.\r\n\r\n39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they\r\ngo forth, and return not unto them.\r\n\r\n39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands\r\nof the wild ass?  39:6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the\r\nbarren land his dwellings.\r\n\r\n39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the\r\ncrying of the driver.\r\n\r\n39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after\r\nevery green thing.\r\n\r\n39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?\r\n39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will\r\nhe harrow the valleys after thee?  39:11 Wilt thou trust him, because\r\nhis strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?  39:12\r\nWilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it\r\ninto thy barn?  39:13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?\r\nor wings and feathers unto the ostrich?  39:14 Which leaveth her eggs\r\nin the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 39:15 And forgetteth that the\r\nfoot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.\r\n\r\n39:16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not\r\nhers: her labour is in vain without fear; 39:17 Because God hath\r\ndeprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.\r\n\r\n39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse\r\nand his rider.\r\n\r\n39:19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck\r\nwith thunder?  39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the\r\nglory of his nostrils is terrible.\r\n\r\n39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth\r\non to meet the armed men.\r\n\r\n39:22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he\r\nback from the sword.\r\n\r\n39:23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n39:24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither\r\nbelieveth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.\r\n\r\n39:25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle\r\nafar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.\r\n\r\n39:26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward\r\nthe south?  39:27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her\r\nnest on high?  39:28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the\r\ncrag of the rock, and the strong place.\r\n\r\n39:29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.\r\n\r\n39:30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,\r\nthere is she.\r\n\r\n40:1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 40:2 Shall he that\r\ncontendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let\r\nhim answer it.\r\n\r\n40:3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 40:4 Behold, I am vile;\r\nwhat shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.\r\n\r\n40:5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will\r\nproceed no further.\r\n\r\n40:6 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,\r\n40:7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and\r\ndeclare thou unto me.\r\n\r\n40:8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that\r\nthou mayest be righteous?  40:9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst\r\nthou thunder with a voice like him?  40:10 Deck thyself now with\r\nmajesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.\r\n\r\n40:11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is\r\nproud, and abase him.\r\n\r\n40:12 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread\r\ndown the wicked in their place.\r\n\r\n40:13 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.\r\n\r\n40:14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can\r\nsave thee.\r\n\r\n40:15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as\r\nan ox.\r\n\r\n40:16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the\r\nnavel of his belly.\r\n\r\n40:17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are\r\nwrapped together.\r\n\r\n40:18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\n40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make\r\nhis sword to approach unto him.\r\n\r\n40:20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts\r\nof the field play.\r\n\r\n40:21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and\r\nfens.\r\n\r\n40:22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the\r\nbrook compass him about.\r\n\r\n40:23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth\r\nthat he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.\r\n\r\n40:24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.\r\n\r\n41:1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a\r\ncord which thou lettest down?  41:2 Canst thou put an hook into his\r\nnose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?  41:3 Will he make many\r\nsupplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?  41:4\r\nWill he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant\r\nfor ever?  41:5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou\r\nbind him for thy maidens?  41:6 Shall the companions make a banquet of\r\nhim? shall they part him among the merchants?  41:7 Canst thou fill\r\nhis skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?  41:8 Lay\r\nthine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.\r\n\r\n41:9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down\r\neven at the sight of him?  41:10 None is so fierce that dare stir him\r\nup: who then is able to stand before me?  41:11 Who hath prevented me,\r\nthat I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.\r\n\r\n41:12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n41:13 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him\r\nwith his double bridle?  41:14 Who can open the doors of his face? his\r\nteeth are terrible round about.\r\n\r\n41:15 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.\r\n\r\n41:16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.\r\n\r\n41:17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they\r\ncannot be sundered.\r\n\r\n41:18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the\r\neyelids of the morning.\r\n\r\n41:19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.\r\n\r\n41:20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or\r\ncaldron.\r\n\r\n41:21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n41:22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n41:23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in\r\nthemselves; they cannot be moved.\r\n\r\n41:24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the\r\nnether millstone.\r\n\r\n41:25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of\r\nbreakings they purify themselves.\r\n\r\n41:26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the\r\ndart, nor the habergeon.\r\n\r\n41:27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.\r\n\r\n41:28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him\r\ninto stubble.\r\n\r\n41:29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a\r\nspear.\r\n\r\n41:30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things\r\nupon the mire.\r\n\r\n41:31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a\r\npot of ointment.\r\n\r\n41:32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to\r\nbe hoary.\r\n\r\n41:33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.\r\n\r\n41:34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children\r\nof pride.\r\n\r\n42:1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 42:2 I know that thou canst\r\ndo every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.\r\n\r\n42:3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I\r\nuttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I\r\nknew not.\r\n\r\n42:4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,\r\nand declare thou unto me.\r\n\r\n42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye\r\nseeth thee.\r\n\r\n42:6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\r\n\r\n42:7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto\r\nJob, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled\r\nagainst thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of\r\nme the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.\r\n\r\n42:8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go\r\nto my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and\r\nmy servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal\r\nwith you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing\r\nwhich is right, like my servant Job.\r\n\r\n42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the\r\nNaamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the\r\nLORD also accepted Job.\r\n\r\n42:10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his\r\nfriends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.\r\n\r\n42:11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters,\r\nand all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat\r\nbread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him\r\nover all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also\r\ngave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.\r\n\r\n42:12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his\r\nbeginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand\r\ncamels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.\r\n\r\n42:13 He had also seven sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\n42:14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the\r\nsecond, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.\r\n\r\n42:15 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters\r\nof Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.\r\n\r\n42:16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his\r\nsons, and his sons\xe2\x80\x99 sons, even four generations.\r\n\r\n42:17 So Job died, being old and full of days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Psalms\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,\r\nnor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the\r\nscornful.\r\n\r\n1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he\r\nmeditate day and night.\r\n\r\n1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that\r\nbringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not\r\nwither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\r\n\r\n1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind\r\ndriveth away.\r\n\r\n1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners\r\nin the congregation of the righteous.\r\n\r\n1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the\r\nungodly shall perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?\r\n\r\n2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\r\ntogether, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,\r\n\r\n2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from\r\nus.\r\n\r\n2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have\r\nthem in derision.\r\n\r\n2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his\r\nsore displeasure.\r\n\r\n2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.\r\n\r\n2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my\r\nSon; this day have I begotten thee.\r\n\r\n2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine\r\ninheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\r\n\r\n2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in\r\npieces like a potter\xe2\x80\x99s vessel.\r\n\r\n2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.\r\n\r\n2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when\r\nhis wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their\r\ntrust in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3:1 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that\r\nrise up against me.\r\n\r\n3:2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up\r\nof mine head.\r\n\r\n3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his\r\nholy hill. Selah.\r\n\r\n3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.\r\n\r\n3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set\r\nthemselves against me round about.\r\n\r\n3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine\r\nenemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the\r\nungodly.\r\n\r\n3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged\r\nme when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.\r\n\r\n4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how\r\nlong will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.\r\n\r\n4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for\r\nhimself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.\r\n\r\n4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your\r\nbed, and be still. Selah.\r\n\r\n4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n4:6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou\r\nup the light of thy countenance upon us.\r\n\r\n4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that\r\ntheir corn and their wine increased.\r\n\r\n4:8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only\r\nmakest me dwell in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5:1 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.\r\n\r\n5:2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto\r\nthee will I pray.\r\n\r\n5:3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning\r\nwill I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.\r\n\r\n5:4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither\r\nshall evil dwell with thee.\r\n\r\n5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers\r\nof iniquity.\r\n\r\n5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor\r\nthe bloody and deceitful man.\r\n\r\n5:7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy\r\nmercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\r\n\r\n5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;\r\nmake thy way straight before my face.\r\n\r\n5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is\r\nvery wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with\r\ntheir tongue.\r\n\r\n5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;\r\ncast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have\r\nrebelled against thee.\r\n\r\n5:11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them\r\never shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that\r\nlove thy name be joyful in thee.\r\n\r\n5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou\r\ncompass him as with a shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy\r\nhot displeasure.\r\n\r\n6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my\r\nbones are vexed.\r\n\r\n6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?\r\n\r\n6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies\xe2\x80\x99 sake.\r\n\r\n6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who\r\nshall give thee thanks?\r\n\r\n6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;\r\nI water my couch with my tears.\r\n\r\n6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of\r\nall mine enemies.\r\n\r\n6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath\r\nheard the voice of my weeping.\r\n\r\n6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return\r\nand be ashamed suddenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7:1 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them\r\nthat persecute me, and deliver me:\r\n\r\n7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while\r\nthere is none to deliver.\r\n\r\n7:3 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my\r\nhands;\r\n\r\n7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,\r\nI have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)\r\n\r\n7:5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread\r\ndown my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.\r\n\r\n7:6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage\r\nof mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n7:7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for\r\ntheir sakes therefore return thou on high.\r\n\r\n7:8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my\r\nrighteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.\r\n\r\n7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish\r\nthe just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.\r\n\r\n7:10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.\r\n\r\n7:11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every\r\nday.\r\n\r\n7:12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and\r\nmade it ready.\r\n\r\n7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he\r\nordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.\r\n\r\n7:14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,\r\nand brought forth falsehood.\r\n\r\n7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which\r\nhe made.\r\n\r\n7:16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent\r\ndealing shall come down upon his own pate.\r\n\r\n7:17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will\r\nsing praise to the name of the LORD most high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8:1 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who\r\nhast set thy glory above the heavens.\r\n\r\n8:2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained\r\nstrength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy\r\nand the avenger.\r\n\r\n8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and\r\nthe stars, which thou hast ordained;\r\n\r\n8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,\r\nthat thou visitest him?\r\n\r\n8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast\r\ncrowned him with glory and honour.\r\n\r\n8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou\r\nhast put all things under his feet:\r\n\r\n8:7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;\r\n\r\n8:8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever\r\npasseth through the paths of the seas.\r\n\r\n8:9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n9:1 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth\r\nall thy marvellous works.\r\n\r\n9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy\r\nname, O thou most High.\r\n\r\n9:3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at\r\nthy presence.\r\n\r\n9:4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the\r\nthrone judging right.\r\n\r\n9:5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,\r\nthou hast put out their name for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n9:6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou\r\nhast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.\r\n\r\n9:7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne\r\nfor judgment.\r\n\r\n9:8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister\r\njudgment to the people in uprightness.\r\n\r\n9:9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in\r\ntimes of trouble.\r\n\r\n9:10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for\r\nthou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.\r\n\r\n9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among\r\nthe people his doings.\r\n\r\n9:12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he\r\nforgetteth not the cry of the humble.\r\n\r\n9:13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of\r\nthem that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:\r\n\r\n9:14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter\r\nof Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.\r\n\r\n9:15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net\r\nwhich they hid is their own foot taken.\r\n\r\n9:16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked\r\nis snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.\r\n\r\n9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that\r\nforget God.\r\n\r\n9:18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of\r\nthe poor shall not perish for ever.\r\n\r\n9:19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in\r\nthy sight.\r\n\r\n9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to\r\nbe but men. Selah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10:1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in\r\ntimes of trouble?\r\n\r\n10:2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be\r\ntaken in the devices that they have imagined.\r\n\r\n10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire, and blesseth the\r\ncovetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.\r\n\r\n10:4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek\r\nafter God: God is not in all his thoughts.\r\n\r\n10:5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of\r\nhis sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.\r\n\r\n10:6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall\r\nnever be in adversity.\r\n\r\n10:7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his\r\ntongue is mischief and vanity.\r\n\r\n10:8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret\r\nplaces doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\n10:9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait\r\nto catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into\r\nhis net.\r\n\r\n10:10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by\r\nhis strong ones.\r\n\r\n10:11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his\r\nface; he will never see it.\r\n\r\n10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.\r\n\r\n10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his\r\nheart, Thou wilt not require it.\r\n\r\n10:14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to\r\nrequite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou\r\nart the helper of the fatherless.\r\n\r\n10:15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his\r\nwickedness till thou find none.\r\n\r\n10:16 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out\r\nof his land.\r\n\r\n10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt\r\nprepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:\r\n\r\n10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the\r\nearth may no more oppress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird\r\nto your mountain?\r\n\r\n11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow\r\nupon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.\r\n\r\n11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?\r\n\r\n11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s throne is in heaven:\r\nhis eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.\r\n\r\n11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth\r\nviolence his soul hateth.\r\n\r\n11:6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an\r\nhorrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.\r\n\r\n11:7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth\r\nbehold the upright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from\r\namong the children of men.\r\n\r\n12:2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering\r\nlips and with a double heart do they speak.\r\n\r\n12:3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that\r\nspeaketh proud things:\r\n\r\n12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our\r\nown: who is lord over us?\r\n\r\n12:5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now\r\nwill I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that\r\npuffeth at him.\r\n\r\n12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a\r\nfurnace of earth, purified seven times.\r\n\r\n12:7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this\r\ngeneration for ever.\r\n\r\n12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13:1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt\r\nthou hide thy face from me?\r\n\r\n13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my\r\nheart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?\r\n\r\n13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I\r\nsleep the sleep of death;\r\n\r\n13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that\r\ntrouble me rejoice when I am moved.\r\n\r\n13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\n13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are\r\ncorrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n14:2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see\r\nif there were any that did understand, and seek God.\r\n\r\n14:3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:\r\nthere is none that doeth good, no, not one.\r\n\r\n14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my\r\npeople as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of\r\nthe righteous.\r\n\r\n14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\n14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the\r\nLORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,\r\nand Israel shall be glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15:1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy\r\nholy hill?\r\n\r\n15:2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and\r\nspeaketh the truth in his heart.\r\n\r\n15:3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his\r\nneighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.\r\n\r\n15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them\r\nthat fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n15:5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward\r\nagainst the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16:1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.\r\n\r\n16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my\r\ngoodness extendeth not to thee;\r\n\r\n16:3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in\r\nwhom is all my delight.\r\n\r\n16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god:\r\ntheir drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their\r\nnames into my lips.\r\n\r\n16:5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou\r\nmaintainest my lot.\r\n\r\n16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a\r\ngoodly heritage.\r\n\r\n16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also\r\ninstruct me in the night seasons.\r\n\r\n16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right\r\nhand, I shall not be moved.\r\n\r\n16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also\r\nshall rest in hope.\r\n\r\n16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou\r\nsuffer thine Holy One to see corruption.\r\n\r\n16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness\r\nof joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17:1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my\r\nprayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.\r\n\r\n17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes\r\nbehold the things that are equal.\r\n\r\n17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;\r\nthou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my\r\nmouth shall not transgress.\r\n\r\n17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept\r\nme from the paths of the destroyer.\r\n\r\n17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.\r\n\r\n17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline\r\nthine ear unto me, and hear my speech.\r\n\r\n17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy\r\nright hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy\r\nwings,\r\n\r\n17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who\r\ncompass me about.\r\n\r\n17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak\r\nproudly.\r\n\r\n17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their\r\neyes bowing down to the earth;\r\n\r\n17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a\r\nyoung lion lurking in secret places.\r\n\r\n17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul\r\nfrom the wicked, which is thy sword:\r\n\r\n17:14 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,\r\nwhich have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest\r\nwith thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest\r\nof their substance to their babes.\r\n\r\n17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be\r\nsatisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.\r\n\r\n18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,\r\nmy strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my\r\nsalvation, and my high tower.\r\n\r\n18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall\r\nI be saved from mine enemies.\r\n\r\n18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men\r\nmade me afraid.\r\n\r\n18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death\r\nprevented me.\r\n\r\n18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he\r\nheard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even\r\ninto his ears.\r\n\r\n18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the\r\nhills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.\r\n\r\n18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his\r\nmouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.\r\n\r\n18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the\r\nwings of the wind.\r\n\r\n18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him\r\nwere dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.\r\n\r\n18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,\r\nhail stones and coals of fire.\r\n\r\n18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his\r\nvoice; hail stones and coals of fire.\r\n\r\n18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out\r\nlightnings, and discomfited them.\r\n\r\n18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of\r\nthe world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the\r\nbreath of thy nostrils.\r\n\r\n18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.\r\n\r\n18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated\r\nme: for they were too strong for me.\r\n\r\n18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my\r\nstay.\r\n\r\n18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,\r\nbecause he delighted in me.\r\n\r\n18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to\r\nthe cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.\r\n\r\n18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly\r\ndeparted from my God.\r\n\r\n18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his\r\nstatutes from me.\r\n\r\n18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my\r\nrighteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.\r\n\r\n18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an\r\nupright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;\r\n\r\n18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward\r\nthou wilt shew thyself froward.\r\n\r\n18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down\r\nhigh looks.\r\n\r\n18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I\r\nleaped over a wall.\r\n\r\n18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:\r\nhe is a buckler to all those that trust in him.\r\n\r\n18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?\r\n\r\n18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and setteth me upon my high\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by\r\nmine arms.\r\n\r\n18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy\r\nright hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.\r\n\r\n18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.\r\n\r\n18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I\r\nturn again till they were consumed.\r\n\r\n18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are\r\nfallen under my feet.\r\n\r\n18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast\r\nsubdued under me those that rose up against me.\r\n\r\n18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might\r\ndestroy them that hate me.\r\n\r\n18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD,\r\nbut he answered them not.\r\n\r\n18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did\r\ncast them out as the dirt in the streets.\r\n\r\n18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and\r\nthou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not\r\nknown shall serve me.\r\n\r\n18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers\r\nshall submit themselves unto me.\r\n\r\n18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my\r\nsalvation be exalted.\r\n\r\n18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.\r\n\r\n18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up\r\nabove those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the\r\nviolent man.\r\n\r\n18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the\r\nheathen, and sing praises unto thy name.\r\n\r\n18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to\r\nhis anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth\r\nhis handywork.\r\n\r\n19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.\r\n\r\n19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to\r\nthe end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,\r\n\r\n19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth\r\nas a strong man to run a race.\r\n\r\n19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit\r\nunto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.\r\n\r\n19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the\r\ntestimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.\r\n\r\n19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the\r\ncommandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.\r\n\r\n19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments\r\nof the LORD are true and righteous altogether.\r\n\r\n19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:\r\nsweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\r\n\r\n19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them\r\nthere is great reward.\r\n\r\n19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\n19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not\r\nhave dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be\r\ninnocent from the great transgression.\r\n\r\n19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be\r\nacceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of\r\nJacob defend thee;\r\n\r\n20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of\r\nZion;\r\n\r\n20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we\r\nwill set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.\r\n\r\n20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him\r\nfrom his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.\r\n\r\n20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember\r\nthe name of the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand\r\nupright.\r\n\r\n20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21:1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation\r\nhow greatly shall he rejoice!\r\n\r\n21:2 Thou hast given him his heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire, and hast not withholden\r\nthe request of his lips. Selah.\r\n\r\n21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou\r\nsettest a crown of pure gold on his head.\r\n\r\n21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of\r\ndays for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n21:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou\r\nlaid upon him.\r\n\r\n21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him\r\nexceeding glad with thy countenance.\r\n\r\n21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the\r\nmost High he shall not be moved.\r\n\r\n21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall\r\nfind out those that hate thee.\r\n\r\n21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger:\r\nthe LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed\r\nfrom among the children of men.\r\n\r\n21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous\r\ndevice, which they are not able to perform.\r\n\r\n21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt\r\nmake ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.\r\n\r\n21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing\r\nand praise thy power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far\r\nfrom helping me, and from the words of my roaring?\r\n\r\n22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the\r\nnight season, and am not silent.\r\n\r\n22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,\r\nand were not confounded.\r\n\r\n22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,\r\nthey shake the head, saying,\r\n\r\n22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver\r\nhim, seeing he delighted in him.\r\n\r\n22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me\r\nhope when I was upon my mother\xe2\x80\x99s breasts.\r\n\r\n22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s belly.\r\n\r\n22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset\r\nme round.\r\n\r\n22:13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a\r\nroaring lion.\r\n\r\n22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:\r\nmy heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.\r\n\r\n22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth\r\nto my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.\r\n\r\n22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have\r\ninclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.\r\n\r\n22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.\r\n\r\n22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.\r\n\r\n22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee\r\nto help me.\r\n\r\n22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the\r\ndog.\r\n\r\n22:21 Save me from the lion\xe2\x80\x99s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the\r\nhorns of the unicorns.\r\n\r\n22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the\r\ncongregation will I praise thee.\r\n\r\n22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,\r\nglorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.\r\n\r\n22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the\r\nafflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried\r\nunto him, he heard.\r\n\r\n22:25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay\r\nmy vows before them that fear him.\r\n\r\n22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD\r\nthat seek him: your heart shall live for ever.\r\n\r\n22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:\r\nand all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.\r\n\r\n22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s: and he is the governor among the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they\r\nthat go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive\r\nhis own soul.\r\n\r\n22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a\r\npeople that shall be born, that he hath done this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.\r\n\r\n23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside\r\nthe still waters.\r\n\r\n23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness\r\nfor his name\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I\r\nwill fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they\r\ncomfort me.\r\n\r\n23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:\r\nthou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\r\n\r\n23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my\r\nlife: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24:1 The earth is the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and\r\nthey that dwell therein.\r\n\r\n24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\n24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD?

be not silent to me: lest,\r\nif thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.\r\n\r\n28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I\r\nlift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.\r\n\r\n28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of\r\niniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in\r\ntheir hearts.\r\n\r\n28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the\r\nwickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their\r\nhands; render to them their desert.\r\n\r\n28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation\r\nof his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.\r\n\r\n28:6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my\r\nsupplications.\r\n\r\n28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,\r\nand I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my\r\nsong will I praise him.\r\n\r\n28:8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his\r\nanointed.\r\n\r\n28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and\r\nlift them up for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD\r\nin the beauty of holiness.\r\n\r\n29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory\r\nthundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.\r\n\r\n29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full\r\nof majesty.\r\n\r\n29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh\r\nthe cedars of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like\r\na young unicorn.\r\n\r\n29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.\r\n\r\n29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh\r\nthe wilderness of Kadesh.\r\n\r\n29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth\r\nthe forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.\r\n\r\n29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for\r\never.\r\n\r\n29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless\r\nhis people with peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast\r\nnot made my foes to rejoice over me.\r\n\r\n30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.\r\n\r\n30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast\r\nkept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.\r\n\r\n30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the\r\nremembrance of his holiness.\r\n\r\n30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:\r\nweeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\r\n\r\n30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.\r\n\r\n30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:\r\nthou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.\r\n\r\n30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.\r\n\r\n30:9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?\r\nShall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?\r\n\r\n30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.\r\n\r\n30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put\r\noff my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;\r\n\r\n30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nO LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust;

therefore for thy name\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake lead me, and guide me.\r\n\r\n31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for\r\nthou art my strength.\r\n\r\n31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD\r\nGod of truth.\r\n\r\n31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered\r\nmy trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;\r\n\r\n31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set\r\nmy feet in a large room.\r\n\r\n31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is\r\nconsumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.\r\n\r\n31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my\r\nstrength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.\r\n\r\n31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my\r\nneighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me\r\nwithout fled from me.\r\n\r\n31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:\r\nwhile they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\n31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.\r\n\r\n31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine\r\nenemies, and from them that persecute me.\r\n\r\n31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy\r\nmercies\xe2\x80\x99 sake.\r\n\r\n31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let\r\nthe wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.\r\n\r\n31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous\r\nthings proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.\r\n\r\n31:19 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them\r\nthat fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee\r\nbefore the sons of men!\r\n\r\n31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the\r\npride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the\r\nstrife of tongues.\r\n\r\n31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous\r\nkindness in a strong city.\r\n\r\n31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:\r\nnevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried\r\nunto thee.\r\n\r\n31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the\r\nfaithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.\r\n\r\n31:24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye\r\nthat hope in the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and\r\nin whose spirit there is no guile.\r\n\r\n32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all\r\nthe day long.\r\n\r\n32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is\r\nturned into the drought of summer. Selah.\r\n\r\n32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.\r\nI said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou\r\nforgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.\r\n\r\n32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time\r\nwhen thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they\r\nshall not come nigh unto him.\r\n\r\n32:7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;\r\nthou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.\r\n\r\n32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt\r\ngo: I will guide thee with mine eye.\r\n\r\n32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no\r\nunderstanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest\r\nthey come near unto thee.\r\n\r\n32:10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the\r\nLORD, mercy shall compass him about.\r\n\r\n32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for\r\njoy, all ye that are upright in heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the\r\nupright.\r\n\r\n33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an\r\ninstrument of ten strings.\r\n\r\n33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.\r\n\r\n33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the\r\ngoodness of the LORD.\r\n\r\n33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host\r\nof them by the breath of his mouth.\r\n\r\n33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth\r\nup the depth in storehouses.\r\n\r\n33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the\r\nworld stand in awe of him.\r\n\r\n33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.\r\n\r\n33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he\r\nmaketh the devices of the people of none effect.\r\n\r\n33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his\r\nheart to all generations.\r\n\r\n33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom\r\nhe hath chosen for his own inheritance.\r\n\r\n33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.\r\n\r\n33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the\r\ninhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\n33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man\r\nis not delivered by much strength.\r\n\r\n33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver\r\nany by his great strength.\r\n\r\n33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon\r\nthem that hope in his mercy;\r\n\r\n33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.\r\n\r\n33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in\r\nhis holy name.\r\n\r\n33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually\r\nbe in my mouth.\r\n\r\n34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear\r\nthereof, and be glad.\r\n\r\n34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.\r\n\r\n34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my\r\nfears.\r\n\r\n34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were\r\nnot ashamed.\r\n\r\n34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of\r\nall his troubles.\r\n\r\n34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,\r\nand delivereth them.\r\n\r\n34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that\r\ntrusteth in him.\r\n\r\n34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that\r\nfear him.\r\n\r\n34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek\r\nthe LORD shall not want any good thing.\r\n\r\n34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he\r\nmay see good?\r\n\r\n34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\r\n\r\n34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.\r\n\r\n34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are\r\nopen unto their cry.\r\n\r\n34:16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off\r\nthe remembrance of them from the earth.\r\n\r\n34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out\r\nof all their troubles.\r\n\r\n34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and\r\nsaveth such as be of a contrite spirit.\r\n\r\n34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD\r\ndelivereth him out of them all.\r\n\r\n34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.\r\n\r\n34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous\r\nshall be desolate.\r\n\r\n34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them\r\nthat trust in him shall be desolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35:1 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight\r\nagainst them that fight against me.\r\n\r\n35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.\r\n\r\n35:3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that\r\npersecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.\r\n\r\n35:4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:\r\nlet them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.\r\n\r\n35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the\r\nLORD chase them.\r\n\r\n35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD\r\npersecute them.\r\n\r\n35:7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which\r\nwithout cause they have digged for my soul.\r\n\r\n35:8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that\r\nhe hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.\r\n\r\n35:9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\n35:10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which\r\ndeliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor\r\nand the needy from him that spoileth him?\r\n\r\n35:11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that\r\nI knew not.\r\n\r\n35:12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.\r\n\r\n35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I\r\nhumbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n35:14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I\r\nbowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.\r\n\r\n35:15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves\r\ntogether: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me,\r\nand I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:\r\n\r\n35:16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with\r\ntheir teeth.\r\n\r\n35:17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their\r\ndestructions, my darling from the lions.\r\n\r\n35:18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise\r\nthee among much people.\r\n\r\n35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:\r\nneither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.\r\n\r\n35:20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters\r\nagainst them that are quiet in the land.\r\n\r\n35:21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,\r\naha, our eye hath seen it.\r\n\r\n35:22 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not\r\nfar from me.\r\n\r\n35:23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,\r\nmy God and my Lord.\r\n\r\n35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let\r\nthem not rejoice over me.\r\n\r\n35:25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let\r\nthem not say, We have swallowed him up.\r\n\r\n35:26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that\r\nrejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour\r\nthat magnify themselves against me.\r\n\r\n35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous\r\ncause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which\r\nhath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.\r\n\r\n35:28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise\r\nall the day long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36:1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there\r\nis no fear of God before his eyes.\r\n\r\n36:2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be\r\nfound to be hateful.\r\n\r\n36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off\r\nto be wise, and to do good.\r\n\r\n36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way\r\nthat is not good; he abhorreth not evil.\r\n\r\n36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness\r\nreacheth unto the clouds.\r\n\r\n36:6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are\r\na great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.\r\n\r\n36:7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the\r\nchildren of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.\r\n\r\n36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;\r\nand thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.\r\n\r\n36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy\r\nrighteousness to the upright in heart.\r\n\r\n36:11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand\r\nof the wicked remove me.\r\n\r\n36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,\r\nand shall not be able to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious\r\nagainst the workers of iniquity.\r\n\r\n37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the\r\ngreen herb.\r\n\r\n37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,\r\nand verily thou shalt be fed.\r\n\r\n37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the\r\ndesires of thine heart.\r\n\r\n37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall\r\nbring it to pass.\r\n\r\n37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy\r\njudgment as the noonday.\r\n\r\n37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself\r\nbecause of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who\r\nbringeth wicked devices to pass.\r\n\r\n37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise\r\nto do evil.\r\n\r\n37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the\r\nLORD, they shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\n37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou\r\nshalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.\r\n\r\n37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight\r\nthemselves in the abundance of peace.\r\n\r\n37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n37:13 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to\r\ncast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows\r\nshall be broken.\r\n\r\n37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of\r\nmany wicked.\r\n\r\n37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD\r\nupholdeth the righteous.\r\n\r\n37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance\r\nshall be for ever.\r\n\r\n37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of\r\nfamine they shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\n37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall\r\nbe as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they\r\nconsume away.\r\n\r\n37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous\r\nsheweth mercy, and giveth.\r\n\r\n37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they\r\nthat be cursed of him shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he\r\ndelighteth in his way.\r\n\r\n37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD\r\nupholdeth him with his hand.\r\n\r\n37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the\r\nrighteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.\r\n\r\n37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.\r\n\r\n37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.\r\n\r\n37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they\r\nare preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for\r\never.\r\n\r\n37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue\r\ntalketh of judgment.\r\n\r\n37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall\r\nslide.\r\n\r\n37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.\r\n\r\n37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he\r\nis judged.\r\n\r\n37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to\r\ninherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.\r\n\r\n37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself\r\nlike a green bay tree.\r\n\r\n37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but\r\nhe could not be found.\r\n\r\n37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of\r\nthat man is peace.\r\n\r\n37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of\r\nthe wicked shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their\r\nstrength in the time of trouble.\r\n\r\n37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver\r\nthem from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38:1 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n38:2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.\r\n\r\n38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither\r\nis there any rest in my bones because of my sin.\r\n\r\n38:4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden\r\nthey are too heavy for me.\r\n\r\n38:5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.\r\n\r\n38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no\r\nsoundness in my flesh.\r\n\r\n38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the\r\ndisquietness of my heart.\r\n\r\n38:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid\r\nfrom thee.\r\n\r\n38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of\r\nmine eyes, it also is gone from me.\r\n\r\n38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my\r\nkinsmen stand afar off.\r\n\r\n38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they\r\nthat seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all\r\nthe day long.\r\n\r\n38:13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that\r\nopeneth not his mouth.\r\n\r\n38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no\r\nreproofs.\r\n\r\n38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.\r\n\r\n38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:\r\nwhen my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.\r\n\r\n38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.\r\n\r\n38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.\r\n\r\n38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that\r\nhate me wrongfully are multiplied.\r\n\r\n38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;\r\nbecause I follow the thing that good is.\r\n\r\n38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.\r\n\r\n38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my\r\ntongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my\r\nsorrow was stirred.\r\n\r\n39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:\r\nthen spake I with my tongue,\r\n\r\n39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what\r\nit is: that I may know how frail I am.\r\n\r\n39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is\r\nas nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is\r\naltogether vanity.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are\r\ndisquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall\r\ngather them.\r\n\r\n39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.\r\n\r\n39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach\r\nof the foolish.\r\n\r\n39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.\r\n\r\n39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of\r\nthine hand.\r\n\r\n39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou\r\nmakest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is\r\nvanity. Selah.\r\n\r\n39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy\r\npeace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as\r\nall my fathers were.\r\n\r\n39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and\r\nbe no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and\r\nheard my cry.\r\n\r\n40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry\r\nclay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.\r\n\r\n40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:\r\nmany shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.\r\n\r\n40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and\r\nrespecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.\r\n\r\n40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast\r\ndone, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned\r\nup in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are\r\nmore than can be numbered.\r\n\r\n40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou\r\nopened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.\r\n\r\n40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written\r\nof me,\r\n\r\n40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I\r\nhave not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.\r\n\r\n40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have\r\ndeclared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy\r\nlovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.\r\n\r\n40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy\r\nlovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.\r\n\r\n40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities\r\nhave taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are\r\nmore than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.\r\n\r\n40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help\r\nme.\r\n\r\n40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my\r\nsoul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that\r\nwish me evil.\r\n\r\n40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto\r\nme, Aha, aha.\r\n\r\n40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let\r\nsuch as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.\r\n\r\n40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art\r\nmy help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver\r\nhim in time of trouble.\r\n\r\n41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be\r\nblessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\n41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou\r\nwilt make all his bed in his sickness.\r\n\r\n41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have\r\nsinned against thee.\r\n\r\n41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name\r\nperish?\r\n\r\n41:6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth\r\niniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.\r\n\r\n41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they\r\ndevise my hurt.\r\n\r\n41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that\r\nhe lieth he shall rise up no more.\r\n\r\n41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat\r\nof my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\r\n\r\n41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I\r\nmay requite them.\r\n\r\n41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth\r\nnot triumph over me.\r\n\r\n41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest\r\nme before thy face for ever.\r\n\r\n41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to\r\neverlasting. Amen, and Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul\r\nafter thee, O God.\r\n\r\n42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come\r\nand appear before God?\r\n\r\n42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually\r\nsay unto me, Where is thy God?\r\n\r\n42:4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had\r\ngone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with\r\nthe voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.\r\n\r\n42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in\r\nme?  hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I\r\nremember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the\r\nhill Mizar.\r\n\r\n42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy\r\nwaves and thy billows are gone over me.\r\n\r\n42:8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and\r\nin the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\n42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I\r\nmourning because of the oppression of the enemy?\r\n\r\n42:10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while\r\nthey say daily unto me, Where is thy God?\r\n\r\n42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted\r\nwithin me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the\r\nhealth of my countenance, and my God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O\r\ndeliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.\r\n\r\n43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?\r\nwhy go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?\r\n\r\n43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them\r\nbring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.\r\n\r\n43:4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:\r\nyea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.\r\n\r\n43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted\r\nwithin me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health\r\nof my countenance, and my God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44:1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,\r\nwhat work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.\r\n\r\n44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst\r\nthem; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.\r\n\r\n44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,\r\nneither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine\r\narm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour\r\nunto them.\r\n\r\n44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.\r\n\r\n44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will\r\nwe tread them under that rise up against us.\r\n\r\n44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.\r\n\r\n44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to\r\nshame that hated us.\r\n\r\n44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth\r\nwith our armies.\r\n\r\n44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate\r\nus spoil for themselves.\r\n\r\n44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast\r\nscattered us among the heathen.\r\n\r\n44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy\r\nwealth by their price.\r\n\r\n44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a\r\nderision to them that are round about us.\r\n\r\n44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head\r\namong the people.\r\n\r\n44:15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face\r\nhath covered me,\r\n\r\n44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason\r\nof the enemy and avenger.\r\n\r\n44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,\r\nneither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.\r\n\r\n44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined\r\nfrom thy way;\r\n\r\n44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and\r\ncovered us with the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our\r\nhands to a strange god;\r\n\r\n44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted\r\nas sheep for the slaughter.\r\n\r\n44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for\r\never.\r\n\r\n44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction\r\nand our oppression?\r\n\r\n44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies\xe2\x80\x99 sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45:1 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I\r\nhave made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.\r\n\r\n45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into\r\nthy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.\r\n\r\n45:3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and\r\nthy majesty.\r\n\r\n45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and\r\nmeekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee\r\nterrible things.\r\n\r\n45:5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king\xe2\x80\x99s enemies;\r\nwhereby the people fall under thee.\r\n\r\n45:6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy\r\nkingdom is a right sceptre.\r\n\r\n45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,\r\nthy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of\r\nthe ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.\r\n\r\n45:9 Kings\xe2\x80\x99 daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right\r\nhand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.\r\n\r\n45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget\r\nalso thine own people, and thy father\xe2\x80\x99s house;\r\n\r\n45:11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord;\r\nand worship thou him.\r\n\r\n45:12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the\r\nrich among the people shall intreat thy favour.\r\n\r\n45:13 The king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of\r\nwrought gold.\r\n\r\n45:14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the\r\nvirgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.\r\n\r\n45:15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall\r\nenter into the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace.\r\n\r\n45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest\r\nmake princes in all the earth.\r\n\r\n45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:\r\ntherefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\r\n\r\n46:2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and\r\nthough the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;\r\n\r\n46:3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the\r\nmountains shake with the swelling thereof.

Selah.\r\n\r\n48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of\r\nthe earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.\r\n\r\n48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,\r\nbecause of thy judgments.\r\n\r\n48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may\r\ntell it to the generation following.\r\n\r\n48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide\r\neven unto death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the\r\nworld:\r\n\r\n49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.\r\n\r\n49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart\r\nshall be of understanding.\r\n\r\n49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying\r\nupon the harp.\r\n\r\n49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of\r\nmy heels shall compass me about?\r\n\r\n49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the\r\nmultitude of their riches;\r\n\r\n49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God\r\na ransom for him:\r\n\r\n49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for\r\never:)\r\n\r\n49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.\r\n\r\n49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the\r\nbrutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.\r\n\r\n49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for\r\never, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their\r\nlands after their own names.\r\n\r\n49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the\r\nbeasts that perish.\r\n\r\n49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their\r\nsayings. Selah.\r\n\r\n49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;\r\nand the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and\r\ntheir beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.\r\n\r\n49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he\r\nshall receive me.

Selah.\r\n\r\n50:7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify\r\nagainst thee: I am God, even thy God.\r\n\r\n50:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt\r\nofferings, to have been continually before me.\r\n\r\n50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy\r\nfolds.\r\n\r\n50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a\r\nthousand hills.\r\n\r\n50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of\r\nthe field are mine.\r\n\r\n50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine,\r\nand the fulness thereof.\r\n\r\n50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?\r\n\r\n50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most\r\nHigh:\r\n\r\n50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and\r\nthou shalt glorify me.\r\n\r\n50:16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare\r\nmy statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?\r\n\r\n50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and\r\nhast been partaker with adulterers.\r\n\r\n50:19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.\r\n\r\n50:20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest\r\nthine own mother\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest\r\nthat I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,\r\nand set them in order before thine eyes.\r\n\r\n50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in\r\npieces, and there be none to deliver.\r\n\r\n50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth\r\nhis conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:\r\naccording unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my\r\ntransgressions.\r\n\r\n51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.\r\n\r\n51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy\r\nsight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be\r\nclear when thou judgest.\r\n\r\n51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother\r\nconceive me.\r\n\r\n51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the\r\nhidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.\r\n\r\n51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall\r\nbe whiter than snow.\r\n\r\n51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast\r\nbroken may rejoice.\r\n\r\n51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.\r\n\r\n51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit\r\nwithin me.\r\n\r\n51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy\r\nfree spirit.\r\n\r\n51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be\r\nconverted unto thee.\r\n\r\n51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my\r\nsalvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.\r\n\r\n51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou\r\ndelightest not in burnt offering.\r\n\r\n51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a\r\ncontrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.\r\n\r\n51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,\r\nwith burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer\r\nbullocks upon thine altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness\r\nof God endureth continually.\r\n\r\n52:2 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working\r\ndeceitfully.\r\n\r\n52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak\r\nrighteousness. Selah.\r\n\r\n52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.\r\n\r\n52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee\r\naway, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of\r\nthe land of the living. Selah.\r\n\r\n52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:\r\n\r\n52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted\r\nin the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\n52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in\r\nthe mercy of God for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I\r\nwill wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are\r\nthey, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if\r\nthere were any that did understand, that did seek God.\r\n\r\n53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become\r\nfilthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\r\n\r\n53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people\r\nas they eat bread: they have not called upon God.\r\n\r\n53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath\r\nscattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put\r\nthem to shame, because God hath despised them.\r\n\r\n53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God\r\nbringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and\r\nIsrael shall be glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.\r\n\r\n54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.\r\n\r\n54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after\r\nmy soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.\r\n\r\n54:4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O\r\nLORD; for it is good.\r\n\r\n54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath\r\nseen his desire upon mine enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a\r\nnoise;\r\n\r\n55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of\r\nthe wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.\r\n\r\n55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are\r\nfallen upon me.\r\n\r\n55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath\r\noverwhelmed me.\r\n\r\n55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly\r\naway, and be at rest.\r\n\r\n55:7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.\r\n\r\n55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen\r\nviolence and strife in the city.\r\n\r\n55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief\r\nalso and sorrow are in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not\r\nfrom her streets.\r\n\r\n55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have\r\nborne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself\r\nagainst me; then I would have hid myself from him:\r\n\r\n55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God\r\nin company.\r\n\r\n55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:\r\nfor wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.\r\n\r\n55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.\r\n\r\n55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:\r\nand he shall hear my voice.\r\n\r\n55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was\r\nagainst me: for there were many with me.\r\n\r\n55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.\r\n\r\nSelah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.\r\n\r\n55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with\r\nhim: he hath broken his covenant.\r\n\r\n55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in\r\nhis heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.\r\n\r\n55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he\r\nshall never suffer the righteous to be moved.\r\n\r\n55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of\r\ndestruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their\r\ndays; but I will trust in thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he\r\nfighting daily oppresseth me.\r\n\r\n56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that\r\nfight against me, O thou most High.\r\n\r\n56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.\r\n\r\n56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will\r\nnot fear what flesh can do unto me.\r\n\r\n56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me\r\nfor evil.\r\n\r\n56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark\r\nmy steps, when they wait for my soul.\r\n\r\n56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the\r\npeople, O God.\r\n\r\n56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:\r\nare they not in thy book?\r\n\r\n56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I\r\nknow; for God is for me.\r\n\r\n56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his\r\nword.\r\n\r\n56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do\r\nunto me.\r\n\r\n56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.\r\n\r\n56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou\r\ndeliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light\r\nof the living?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul\r\ntrusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my\r\nrefuge, until these calamities be overpast.\r\n\r\n57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all\r\nthings for me.\r\n\r\n57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him\r\nthat would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and\r\nhis truth.\r\n\r\n57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on\r\nfire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and\r\ntheir tongue a sharp sword.\r\n\r\n57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above\r\nall the earth.\r\n\r\n57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:\r\nthey have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are\r\nfallen themselves. Selah.\r\n\r\n57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto\r\nthee among the nations.\r\n\r\n57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\n57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be\r\nabove all the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge\r\nuprightly, O ye sons of men?\r\n\r\n58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your\r\nhands in the earth.\r\n\r\n58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as\r\nthey be born, speaking lies.\r\n\r\n58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the\r\ndeaf adder that stoppeth her ear;\r\n\r\n58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never\r\nso wisely.\r\n\r\n58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great\r\nteeth of the young lions, O LORD.\r\n\r\n58:7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he\r\nbendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.\r\n\r\n58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like\r\nthe untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.\r\n\r\n58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as\r\nwith a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.\r\n\r\n58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he\r\nshall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.\r\n\r\n58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the\r\nrighteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that\r\nrise up against me.\r\n\r\n59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered\r\nagainst me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.\r\n\r\n59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help\r\nme, and behold.\r\n\r\n59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to\r\nvisit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go\r\nround about the city.\r\n\r\n59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their\r\nlips: for who, say they, doth hear?\r\n\r\n59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the\r\nheathen in derision.\r\n\r\n59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my\r\ndesire upon mine enemies.\r\n\r\n59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power;\r\nand bring them down, O Lord our shield.\r\n\r\n59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them\r\neven be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and\r\nlet them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a\r\ndog, and go round about the city.\r\n\r\n59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy\r\nmercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the\r\nday of my trouble.\r\n\r\n59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,\r\nand the God of my mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast\r\nbeen displeased; O turn thyself to us again.\r\n\r\n60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal\r\nthe breaches thereof; for it shaketh.\r\n\r\n60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to\r\ndrink the wine of astonishment.\r\n\r\n60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be\r\ndisplayed because of the truth. Selah.\r\n\r\n60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and\r\nhear me.\r\n\r\n60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide\r\nShechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.\r\n\r\n60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the\r\nstrength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;\r\n\r\n60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,\r\ntriumph thou because of me.\r\n\r\n60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into\r\nEdom?\r\n\r\n60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,\r\nwhich didst not go out with our armies?\r\n\r\n60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.\r\n\r\n60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread\r\ndown our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.\r\n\r\n61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is\r\noverwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.\r\n\r\n61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the\r\ncovert of thy wings. Selah.\r\n\r\n61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the\r\nheritage of those that fear thy name.\r\n\r\n61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king\xe2\x80\x99s life: and his years as many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,\r\nwhich may preserve him.\r\n\r\n61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily\r\nperform my vows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.\r\n\r\n62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall\r\nnot be greatly moved.\r\n\r\n62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be\r\nslain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering\r\nfence.\r\n\r\n62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they\r\ndelight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.\r\n\r\n62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall\r\nnot be moved.\r\n\r\n62:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and\r\nmy refuge, is in God.\r\n\r\n62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before\r\nhim: God is a refuge for us. Selah.\r\n\r\n62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a\r\nlie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\n62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if\r\nriches increase, set not your heart upon them.\r\n\r\n62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power\r\nbelongeth unto God.\r\n\r\n62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to\r\nevery man according to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth\r\nfor thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where\r\nno water is;\r\n\r\n63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall\r\npraise thee.\r\n\r\n63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in\r\nthy name.\r\n\r\n63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my\r\nmouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:\r\n\r\n63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the\r\nnight watches.\r\n\r\n63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy\r\nwings will I rejoice.\r\n\r\n63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.\r\n\r\n63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the\r\nlower parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.\r\n\r\n63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by\r\nhim shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64:1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\n64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the\r\ninsurrection of the workers of iniquity:\r\n\r\n64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot\r\ntheir arrows, even bitter words:\r\n\r\n64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they\r\nshoot at him, and fear not.\r\n\r\n64:5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of\r\nlaying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?\r\n\r\n64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:\r\nboth the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.\r\n\r\n64:7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all\r\nthat see them shall flee away.\r\n\r\n64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for\r\nthey shall wisely consider of his doing.\r\n\r\n64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;\r\nand all the upright in heart shall glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the\r\nvow be performed.\r\n\r\n65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.\r\n\r\n65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou\r\nshalt purge them away.\r\n\r\n65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach\r\nunto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with\r\nthe goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.\r\n\r\n65:5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of\r\nour salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth,\r\nand of them that are afar off upon the sea:\r\n\r\n65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded\r\nwith power:\r\n\r\n65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,\r\nand the tumult of the people.\r\n\r\n65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy\r\ntokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to\r\nrejoice.\r\n\r\n65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest\r\nit with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them\r\ncorn, when thou hast so provided for it.\r\n\r\n65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the\r\nfurrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the\r\nspringing thereof.\r\n\r\n65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop\r\nfatness.\r\n\r\n65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little\r\nhills rejoice on every side.\r\n\r\n65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are\r\ncovered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:\r\n\r\n66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.\r\n\r\n66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the\r\ngreatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they\r\nshall sing to thy name. Selah.\r\n\r\n66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward\r\nthe children of men.\r\n\r\n66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on\r\nfoot: there did we rejoice in him.\r\n\r\n66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let\r\nnot the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.\r\n\r\n66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to\r\nbe heard:\r\n\r\n66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver\r\nis tried.\r\n\r\n66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our\r\nloins.\r\n\r\n66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through\r\nfire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee\r\nmy vows,\r\n\r\n66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was\r\nin trouble.\r\n\r\n66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the\r\nincense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.\r\n\r\n66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he\r\nhath done for my soul.\r\n\r\n66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:\r\n\r\n66:19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of\r\nmy prayer.\r\n\r\n66:20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his\r\nmercy from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67:1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to\r\nshine upon us; Selah.\r\n\r\n67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge\r\nthe people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.\r\n\r\n67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own\r\nGod, shall bless us.\r\n\r\n67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that\r\nhate him flee before him.\r\n\r\n68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth\r\nbefore the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.\r\n\r\n68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea,\r\nlet them exceedingly rejoice.\r\n\r\n68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth\r\nupon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.\r\n\r\n68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in\r\nhis holy habitation.\r\n\r\n68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which\r\nare bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.\r\n\r\n68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst\r\nmarch through the wilderness; Selah:\r\n\r\n68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:\r\neven Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.\r\n\r\n68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst\r\nconfirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.\r\n\r\n68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared\r\nof thy goodness for the poor.\r\n\r\n68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that\r\npublished it.\r\n\r\n68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home\r\ndivided the spoil.\r\n\r\n68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings\r\nof a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.\r\n\r\n68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in\r\nSalmon.\r\n\r\n68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the\r\nhill of Bashan.\r\n\r\n68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth\r\nto dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.\r\n\r\n68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of\r\nangels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.\r\n\r\n68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:\r\nthou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that\r\nthe LORD God might dwell among them.\r\n\r\n68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even\r\nthe God of our salvation. Selah.\r\n\r\n68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the\r\nLord belong the issues from death.\r\n\r\n68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp\r\nof such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.\r\n\r\n68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my\r\npeople again from the depths of the sea:\r\n\r\n68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and\r\nthe tongue of thy dogs in the same.\r\n\r\n68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my\r\nKing, in the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed\r\nafter; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.\r\n\r\n68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the\r\nfountain of Israel.\r\n\r\n68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah\r\nand their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of\r\nNaphtali.\r\n\r\n68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that\r\nwhich thou hast wrought for us.\r\n\r\n68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents\r\nunto thee.\r\n\r\n68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with\r\nthe calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of\r\nsilver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.\r\n\r\n68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out\r\nher hands unto God.\r\n\r\n68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the\r\nLord; Selah:\r\n\r\n68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of\r\nold; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.\r\n\r\n68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and\r\nhis strength is in the clouds.\r\n\r\n68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of\r\nIsrael is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed\r\nbe God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.\r\n\r\n69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into\r\ndeep waters, where the floods overflow me.\r\n\r\n69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while\r\nI wait for my God.\r\n\r\n69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine\r\nhead: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are\r\nmighty: then I restored that which I took not away.\r\n\r\n69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed\r\nfor my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O\r\nGod of Israel.\r\n\r\n69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my\r\nface.\r\n\r\n69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s children.\r\n\r\n69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches\r\nof them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.\r\n\r\n69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song\r\nof the drunkards.\r\n\r\n69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable\r\ntime: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of\r\nthy salvation.\r\n\r\n69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be\r\ndelivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.\r\n\r\n69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow\r\nme up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.\r\n\r\n69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me\r\naccording to the multitude of thy tender mercies.\r\n\r\n69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:\r\nhear me speedily.\r\n\r\n69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of\r\nmine enemies.\r\n\r\n69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:\r\nmine adversaries are all before thee.\r\n\r\n69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I\r\nlooked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters,\r\nbut I found none.\r\n\r\n69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave\r\nme vinegar to drink.\r\n\r\n69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which\r\nshould have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.\r\n\r\n69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their\r\nloins continually to shake.\r\n\r\n69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger\r\ntake hold of them.\r\n\r\n69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their\r\ntents.\r\n\r\n69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to\r\nthe grief of those whom thou hast wounded.\r\n\r\n69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be\r\nwritten with the righteous.\r\n\r\n69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up\r\non high.\r\n\r\n69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him\r\nwith thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock\r\nthat hath horns and hoofs.\r\n\r\n69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall\r\nlive that seek God.\r\n\r\n69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.\r\n\r\n69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing\r\nthat moveth therein.\r\n\r\n69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that\r\nthey may dwell there, and have it in possession.\r\n\r\n69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that\r\nlove his name shall dwell therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70:1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.\r\n\r\n70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let\r\nthem be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.\r\n\r\n70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,\r\nAha, aha.\r\n\r\n70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let\r\nsuch as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.\r\n\r\n70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my\r\nhelp and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline\r\nthine ear unto me, and save me.\r\n\r\n71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:\r\nthou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the\r\nhand of the unrighteous and cruel man.\r\n\r\n71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that\r\ntook me out of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s bowels: my praise shall be continually of\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.\r\n\r\n71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my\r\nstrength faileth.\r\n\r\n71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my\r\nsoul take counsel together,\r\n\r\n71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there\r\nis none to deliver him.\r\n\r\n71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.\r\n\r\n71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my\r\nsoul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\n71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation\r\nall the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.\r\n\r\n71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention\r\nof thy righteousness, even of thine only.\r\n\r\n71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I\r\ndeclared thy wondrous works.\r\n\r\n71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;\r\nuntil I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power\r\nto every one that is to come.\r\n\r\n71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great\r\nthings: O God, who is like unto thee!\r\n\r\n71:20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt\r\nquicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.\r\n\r\n71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my\r\nGod: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my\r\nsoul, which thou hast redeemed.\r\n\r\n71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:\r\nfor they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little\r\nhills, by righteousness.\r\n\r\n72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children\r\nof the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.\r\n\r\n72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,\r\nthroughout all generations.\r\n\r\n72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that\r\nwater the earth.\r\n\r\n72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace\r\nso long as the moon endureth.\r\n\r\n72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river\r\nunto the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his\r\nenemies shall lick the dust.\r\n\r\n72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the\r\nkings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.\r\n\r\n72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall\r\nserve him.\r\n\r\n72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,\r\nand him that hath no helper.\r\n\r\n72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of\r\nthe needy.\r\n\r\n72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and\r\nprecious shall their blood be in his sight.\r\n\r\n72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of\r\nSheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall\r\nhe be praised.\r\n\r\n72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of\r\nthe mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of\r\nthe city shall flourish like grass of the earth.\r\n\r\n72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as\r\nlong as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall\r\ncall him blessed.\r\n\r\n72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth\r\nwondrous things.\r\n\r\n72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole\r\nearth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.\r\n\r\n72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh\r\nslipped.\r\n\r\n73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of\r\nthe wicked.\r\n\r\n73:4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n73:5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued\r\nlike other men.\r\n\r\n73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence\r\ncovereth them as a garment.\r\n\r\n73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart\r\ncould wish.\r\n\r\n73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they\r\nspeak loftily.\r\n\r\n73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue\r\nwalketh through the earth.\r\n\r\n73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are\r\nwrung out to them.\r\n\r\n73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the\r\nmost High?\r\n\r\n73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they\r\nincrease in riches.\r\n\r\n73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in\r\ninnocency.\r\n\r\n73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the\r\ngeneration of thy children.\r\n\r\n73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;\r\n\r\n73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their\r\nend.\r\n\r\n73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst\r\nthem down into destruction.\r\n\r\n73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are\r\nutterly consumed with terrors.\r\n\r\n73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou\r\nshalt despise their image.\r\n\r\n73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.\r\n\r\n73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.\r\n\r\n73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by\r\nmy right hand.\r\n\r\n73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me\r\nto glory.\r\n\r\n73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth\r\nthat I desire beside thee.\r\n\r\n73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my\r\nheart, and my portion for ever.\r\n\r\n73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast\r\ndestroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.\r\n\r\n73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust\r\nin the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger\r\nsmoke against the sheep of thy pasture?\r\n\r\n74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the\r\nrod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,\r\nwherein thou hast dwelt.\r\n\r\n74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that\r\nthe enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up\r\ntheir ensigns for signs.\r\n\r\n74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the\r\nthick trees.\r\n\r\n74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes\r\nand hammers.\r\n\r\n74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by\r\ncasting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.\r\n\r\n74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they\r\nhave burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.\r\n\r\n74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is\r\nthere among us any that knoweth how long.\r\n\r\n74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy\r\nblaspheme thy name for ever?\r\n\r\n74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out\r\nof thy bosom.\r\n\r\n74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the\r\nheads of the dragons in the waters.\r\n\r\n74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to\r\nbe meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.\r\n\r\n74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up\r\nmighty rivers.\r\n\r\n74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared\r\nthe light and the sun.\r\n\r\n74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made\r\nsummer and winter.\r\n\r\n74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that\r\nthe foolish people have blasphemed thy name.\r\n\r\n74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of\r\nthe wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.\r\n\r\n74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth\r\nare full of the habitations of cruelty.\r\n\r\n74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy\r\npraise thy name.\r\n\r\n74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish\r\nman reproacheth thee daily.\r\n\r\n74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that\r\nrise up against thee increaseth continually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:\r\nfor that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.\r\n\r\n75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.\r\n\r\n75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear\r\nup the pillars of it. Selah.\r\n\r\n75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,\r\nLift not up the horn:\r\n\r\n75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.\r\n\r\n75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,\r\nnor from the south.\r\n\r\n75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;\r\nit is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs\r\nthereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of\r\nJacob.\r\n\r\n75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns\r\nof the righteous shall be exalted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.\r\n\r\n76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.\r\n\r\n76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,\r\nand the battle. Selah.\r\n\r\n76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.\r\n\r\n76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and\r\nnone of the men of might have found their hands.\r\n\r\n76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are\r\ncast into a dead sleep.\r\n\r\n76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight\r\nwhen once thou art angry?\r\n\r\n76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth\r\nfeared, and was still,\r\n\r\n76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of\r\nwrath shalt thou restrain.\r\n\r\n76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about\r\nhim bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.\r\n\r\n76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the\r\nkings of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and\r\nhe gave ear unto me.\r\n\r\n77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the\r\nnight, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.\r\n\r\n77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit\r\nwas overwhelmed. Selah.\r\n\r\n77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.\r\n\r\n77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine\r\nown heart: and my spirit made diligent search.\r\n\r\n77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no\r\nmore?\r\n\r\n77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for\r\nevermore?\r\n\r\n77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his\r\ntender mercies? Selah.\r\n\r\n77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years\r\nof the right hand of the most High.\r\n\r\n77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember\r\nthy wonders of old.\r\n\r\n77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.\r\n\r\n77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as\r\nour God?\r\n\r\n77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy\r\nstrength among the people.\r\n\r\n77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob\r\nand Joseph. Selah.\r\n\r\n77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were\r\nafraid: the depths also were troubled.\r\n\r\n77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine\r\narrows also went abroad.\r\n\r\n77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings\r\nlightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.\r\n\r\n77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy\r\nfootsteps are not known.\r\n\r\n77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and\r\nAaron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words\r\nof my mouth.\r\n\r\n78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of\r\nold:\r\n\r\n78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.\r\n\r\n78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the\r\ngeneration to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his\r\nwonderful works that he hath done.\r\n\r\n78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in\r\nIsrael, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them\r\nknown to their children:\r\n\r\n78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children\r\nwhich should be born; who should arise and declare them to their\r\nchildren:\r\n\r\n78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works\r\nof God, but keep his commandments:\r\n\r\n78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious\r\ngeneration; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose\r\nspirit was not stedfast with God.\r\n\r\n78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned\r\nback in the day of battle.\r\n\r\n78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his\r\nlaw;\r\n\r\n78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.\r\n\r\n78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the\r\nland of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.\r\n\r\n78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made\r\nthe waters to stand as an heap.\r\n\r\n78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night\r\nwith a light of fire.\r\n\r\n78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out\r\nof the great depths.\r\n\r\n78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to\r\nrun down like rivers.\r\n\r\n78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High\r\nin the wilderness.\r\n\r\n78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their\r\nlust.\r\n\r\n78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table\r\nin the wilderness?\r\n\r\n78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the\r\nstreams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for\r\nhis people?\r\n\r\n78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was\r\nkindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;\r\n\r\n78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his\r\nsalvation:\r\n\r\n78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the\r\ndoors of heaven,\r\n\r\n78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them\r\nof the corn of heaven.\r\n\r\n78:25 Man did eat angels\xe2\x80\x99 food: he sent them meat to the full.\r\n\r\n78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power\r\nhe brought in the south wind.\r\n\r\n78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like\r\nas the sand of the sea:\r\n\r\n78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their\r\nown desire;\r\n\r\n78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat\r\nwas yet in their mouths,\r\n\r\n78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,\r\nand smote down the chosen men of Israel.\r\n\r\n78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his\r\nwondrous works.\r\n\r\n78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years\r\nin trouble.\r\n\r\n78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and\r\nenquired early after God.\r\n\r\n78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God\r\ntheir redeemer.\r\n\r\n78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they\r\nlied unto him with their tongues.\r\n\r\n78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they\r\nstedfast in his covenant.\r\n\r\n78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and\r\ndestroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did\r\nnot stir up all his wrath.\r\n\r\n78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth\r\naway, and cometh not again.\r\n\r\n78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him\r\nin the desert!\r\n\r\n78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them\r\nfrom the enemy.\r\n\r\n78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the\r\nfield of Zoan.\r\n\r\n78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that\r\nthey could not drink.\r\n\r\n78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;\r\nand frogs, which destroyed them.\r\n\r\n78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their\r\nlabour unto the locust.\r\n\r\n78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees\r\nwith frost.\r\n\r\n78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to\r\nhot thunderbolts.\r\n\r\n78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and\r\nindignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.\r\n\r\n78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,\r\nbut gave their life over to the pestilence;\r\n\r\n78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their\r\nstrength in the tabernacles of Ham:\r\n\r\n78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them\r\nin the wilderness like a flock.\r\n\r\n78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea\r\noverwhelmed their enemies.\r\n\r\n78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this\r\nmountain, which his right hand had purchased.\r\n\r\n78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an\r\ninheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their\r\ntents.\r\n\r\n78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not\r\nhis testimonies:\r\n\r\n78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they\r\nwere turned aside like a deceitful bow.\r\n\r\n78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved\r\nhim to jealousy with their graven images.\r\n\r\n78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:\r\n\r\n78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he\r\nplaced among men;\r\n\r\n78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into\r\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with\r\nhis inheritance.\r\n\r\n78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not\r\ngiven to marriage.\r\n\r\n78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no\r\nlamentation.\r\n\r\n78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man\r\nthat shouteth by reason of wine.\r\n\r\n78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a\r\nperpetual reproach.\r\n\r\n78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the\r\ntribe of Ephraim:\r\n\r\n78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.\r\n\r\n78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth\r\nwhich he hath established for ever.\r\n\r\n78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the\r\nsheepfolds:\r\n\r\n78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed\r\nJacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.\r\n\r\n78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and\r\nguided them by the skilfulness of his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy\r\ntemple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.\r\n\r\n79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto\r\nthe fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and\r\nthere was none to bury them.\r\n\r\n79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision\r\nto them that are round about us.\r\n\r\n79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy\r\nburn like fire?\r\n\r\n79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and\r\nupon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.\r\n\r\n79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.\r\n\r\n79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender\r\nmercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.\r\n\r\n79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and\r\ndeliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be\r\nknown among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of\r\nthy servants which is shed.\r\n\r\n79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to\r\nthe greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to\r\ndie;\r\n\r\n79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their\r\nreproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.\r\n\r\n79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks\r\nfor ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a\r\nflock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.\r\n\r\n80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,\r\nand come and save us.\r\n\r\n80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall\r\nbe saved.\r\n\r\n80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the\r\nprayer of thy people?\r\n\r\n80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears\r\nto drink in great measure.\r\n\r\n80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies\r\nlaugh among themselves.\r\n\r\n80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and\r\nwe shall be saved.\r\n\r\n80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the\r\nheathen, and planted it.\r\n\r\n80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep\r\nroot, and it filled the land.\r\n\r\n80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs\r\nthereof were like the goodly cedars.\r\n\r\n80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they\r\nwhich pass by the way do pluck her?\r\n\r\n80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of\r\nthe field doth devour it.\r\n\r\n80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,\r\nand behold, and visit this vine;\r\n\r\n80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the\r\nbranch that thou madest strong for thyself.\r\n\r\n80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the\r\nrebuke of thy countenance.\r\n\r\n80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of\r\nman whom thou madest strong for thyself.\r\n\r\n80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call\r\nupon thy name.\r\n\r\n80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and\r\nwe shall be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the\r\nGod of Jacob.\r\n\r\n81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp\r\nwith the psaltery.\r\n\r\n81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on\r\nour solemn feast day.\r\n\r\n81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.\r\n\r\n81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out\r\nthrough the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered\r\nfrom the pots.\r\n\r\n81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee\r\nin the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of\r\nMeribah.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if\r\nthou wilt hearken unto me;\r\n\r\n81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship\r\nany strange god.\r\n\r\n81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of\r\nEgypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.\r\n\r\n81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would\r\nnone of me.\r\n\r\n81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts\xe2\x80\x99 lust: and they walked\r\nin their own counsels.\r\n\r\n81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked\r\nin my ways!\r\n\r\n81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand\r\nagainst their adversaries.\r\n\r\n81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto\r\nhim: but their time should have endured for ever.\r\n\r\n81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and\r\nwith honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among\r\nthe gods.\r\n\r\n82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the\r\nwicked? Selah.\r\n\r\n82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and\r\nneedy.\r\n\r\n82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\n82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in\r\ndarkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.\r\n\r\n82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most\r\nHigh.\r\n\r\n82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.\r\n\r\n82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not\r\nstill, O God.\r\n\r\n83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee\r\nhave lifted up the head.\r\n\r\n83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted\r\nagainst thy hidden ones.\r\n\r\n83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a\r\nnation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.\r\n\r\n83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are\r\nconfederate against thee:\r\n\r\n83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the\r\nHagarenes;\r\n\r\n83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the\r\ninhabitants of Tyre;\r\n\r\n83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of\r\nLot.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,\r\nat the brook of Kison:\r\n\r\n83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.\r\n\r\n83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their\r\nprinces as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:\r\n\r\n83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the\r\nmountains on fire;\r\n\r\n83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with\r\nthy storm.\r\n\r\n83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be\r\nput to shame, and perish:\r\n\r\n83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art\r\nthe most high over all the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!\r\n\r\n84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:\r\nmy heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.\r\n\r\n84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for\r\nherself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of\r\nhosts, my King, and my God.\r\n\r\n84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still\r\npraising thee. Selah.\r\n\r\n84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are\r\nthe ways of them.\r\n\r\n84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain\r\nalso filleth the pools.\r\n\r\n84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion\r\nappeareth before God.\r\n\r\n84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine\r\nanointed.\r\n\r\n84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather\r\nbe a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\n84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace\r\nand glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk\r\nuprightly.\r\n\r\n84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought\r\nback the captivity of Jacob.\r\n\r\n85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered\r\nall their sin. Selah.\r\n\r\n85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from\r\nthe fierceness of thine anger.\r\n\r\n85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us\r\nto cease.\r\n\r\n85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine\r\nanger to all generations?\r\n\r\n85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in\r\nthee?\r\n\r\n85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.\r\n\r\n85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace\r\nunto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\n85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may\r\ndwell in our land.\r\n\r\n85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have\r\nkissed each other.\r\n\r\n85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall\r\nlook down from heaven.\r\n\r\n85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall\r\nyield her increase.\r\n\r\n85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way\r\nof his steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.\r\n\r\n86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant\r\nthat trusteth in thee.\r\n\r\n86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.\r\n\r\n86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift\r\nup my soul.\r\n\r\n86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in\r\nmercy unto all them that call upon thee.\r\n\r\n86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my\r\nsupplications.\r\n\r\n86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt\r\nanswer me.\r\n\r\n86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are\r\nthere any works like unto thy works.\r\n\r\n86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before\r\nthee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.\r\n\r\n86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my\r\nheart to fear thy name.\r\n\r\n86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will\r\nglorify thy name for evermore.\r\n\r\n86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my\r\nsoul from the lowest hell.\r\n\r\n86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of\r\nviolent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,\r\nlong suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.\r\n\r\n86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto\r\nthy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.\r\n\r\n86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,\r\nand be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.\r\n\r\n87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of\r\nJacob.\r\n\r\n87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.\r\n\r\n87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:\r\nbehold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.\r\n\r\n87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her:\r\nand the highest himself shall establish her.\r\n\r\n87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this\r\nman was born there. Selah.\r\n\r\n87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there:\r\nall my springs are in thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before\r\nthee:\r\n\r\n88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;\r\n\r\n88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\n88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man\r\nthat hath no strength:\r\n\r\n88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom\r\nthou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.\r\n\r\n88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.\r\n\r\n88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all\r\nthy waves. Selah.\r\n\r\n88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made\r\nme an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.\r\n\r\n88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called\r\ndaily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.\r\n\r\n88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and\r\npraise thee? Selah.\r\n\r\n88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy\r\nfaithfulness in destruction?\r\n\r\n88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in\r\nthe land of forgetfulness?\r\n\r\n88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my\r\nprayer prevent thee.\r\n\r\n88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face\r\nfrom me?\r\n\r\n88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer\r\nthy terrors I am distracted.\r\n\r\n88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.\r\n\r\n88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me\r\nabout together.\r\n\r\n88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine\r\nacquaintance into darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth\r\nwill I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.\r\n\r\n89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy\r\nfaithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.\r\n\r\n89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to\r\nall generations. Selah.\r\n\r\n89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy\r\nfaithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.\r\n\r\n89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among\r\nthe sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?\r\n\r\n89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to\r\nbe had in reverence of all them that are about him.\r\n\r\n89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to\r\nthy faithfulness round about thee?\r\n\r\n89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,\r\nthou stillest them.\r\n\r\n89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou\r\nhast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.\r\n\r\n89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world\r\nand the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.\r\n\r\n89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon\r\nshall rejoice in thy name.\r\n\r\n89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and\r\ntruth shall go before thy face.\r\n\r\n89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall\r\nwalk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.\r\n\r\n89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy\r\nrighteousness shall they be exalted.\r\n\r\n89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our\r\nhorn shall be exalted.\r\n\r\n89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our\r\nking.\r\n\r\n89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have\r\nlaid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall\r\nstrengthen him.\r\n\r\n89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness\r\nafflict him.\r\n\r\n89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them\r\nthat hate him.\r\n\r\n89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my\r\nname shall his horn be exalted.\r\n\r\n89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock\r\nof my salvation.\r\n\r\n89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall\r\nstand fast with him.\r\n\r\n89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as\r\nthe days of heaven.\r\n\r\n89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;\r\n\r\n89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;\r\n\r\n89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their\r\niniquity with stripes.\r\n\r\n89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,\r\nnor suffer my faithfulness to fail.\r\n\r\n89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone\r\nout of my lips.\r\n\r\n89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.\r\n\r\n89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful\r\nwitness in heaven. Selah.\r\n\r\n89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with\r\nthine anointed.\r\n\r\n89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast\r\nprofaned his crown by casting it to the ground.\r\n\r\n89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his\r\nstrong holds to ruin.\r\n\r\n89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast\r\nmade all his enemies to rejoice.\r\n\r\n89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made\r\nhim to stand in the battle.\r\n\r\n89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him\r\nwith shame. Selah.\r\n\r\n89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath\r\nburn like fire?\r\n\r\n89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men\r\nin vain?\r\n\r\n89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he\r\ndeliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.\r\n\r\n89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest\r\nunto David in thy truth?\r\n\r\n89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in\r\nmy bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;\r\n\r\n89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they\r\nhave reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.\r\n\r\n89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.\r\n\r\n90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst\r\nformed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,\r\nthou art God.\r\n\r\n90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children\r\nof men.\r\n\r\n90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is\r\npast, and as a watch in the night.\r\n\r\n90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in\r\nthe morning they are like grass which groweth up.\r\n\r\n90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it\r\nis cut down, and withereth.\r\n\r\n90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the\r\nlight of thy countenance.\r\n\r\n90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years\r\nas a tale that is told.\r\n\r\n90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by\r\nreason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength\r\nlabour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.\r\n\r\n90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy\r\nfear, so is thy wrath.\r\n\r\n90:12 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts\r\nunto wisdom.\r\n\r\n90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be\r\nglad all our days.\r\n\r\n90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted\r\nus, and the years wherein we have seen evil.\r\n\r\n90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish\r\nthou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands\r\nestablish thou it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide\r\nunder the shadow of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;\r\nin him will I trust.\r\n\r\n91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and\r\nfrom the noisome pestilence.\r\n\r\n91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt\r\nthou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.\r\n\r\n91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the\r\narrow that flieth by day;\r\n\r\n91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the\r\ndestruction that wasteth at noonday.\r\n\r\n91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right\r\nhand; but it shall not come nigh thee.\r\n\r\n91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\n91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the\r\nmost High, thy habitation;\r\n\r\n91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come\r\nnigh thy dwelling.\r\n\r\n91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in\r\nall thy ways.\r\n\r\n91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot\r\nagainst a stone.\r\n\r\n91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the\r\ndragon shalt thou trample under feet.\r\n\r\n91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver\r\nhim: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.\r\n\r\n91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him\r\nin trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.\r\n\r\n91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing\r\npraises unto thy name, O most High:\r\n\r\n92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy\r\nfaithfulness every night,\r\n\r\n92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon\r\nthe harp with a solemn sound.\r\n\r\n92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will\r\ntriumph in the works of thy hands.\r\n\r\n92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.\r\n\r\n92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.\r\n\r\n92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of\r\niniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:\r\n\r\n92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.\r\n\r\n92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall\r\nperish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.\r\n\r\n92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I\r\nshall be anointed with fresh oil.\r\n\r\n92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears\r\nshall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.\r\n\r\n92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow\r\nlike a cedar in Lebanon.\r\n\r\n92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in\r\nthe courts of our God.\r\n\r\n92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat\r\nand flourishing;\r\n\r\n92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no\r\nunrighteousness in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is\r\nclothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world\r\nalso is stablished, that it cannot be moved.\r\n\r\n93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.\r\n\r\n93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up\r\ntheir voice; the floods lift up their waves.\r\n\r\n93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea,\r\nthan the mighty waves of the sea.\r\n\r\n93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O\r\nLORD, for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance\r\nbelongeth, shew thyself.\r\n\r\n94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the\r\nproud.\r\n\r\n94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked\r\ntriumph?\r\n\r\n94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the\r\nworkers of iniquity boast themselves?\r\n\r\n94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.\r\n\r\n94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of\r\nJacob regard it.\r\n\r\n94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will\r\nye be wise?\r\n\r\n94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the\r\neye, shall he not see?\r\n\r\n94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that\r\nteacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?\r\n\r\n94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.\r\n\r\n94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest\r\nhim out of thy law;\r\n\r\n94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until\r\nthe pit be digged for the wicked.\r\n\r\n94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he\r\nforsake his inheritance.\r\n\r\n94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the\r\nupright in heart shall follow it.\r\n\r\n94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand\r\nup for me against the workers of iniquity?\r\n\r\n94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.\r\n\r\n94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight\r\nmy soul.\r\n\r\n94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which\r\nframeth mischief by a law?\r\n\r\n94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the\r\nrighteous, and condemn the innocent blood.\r\n\r\n94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.\r\n\r\n94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut\r\nthem off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to\r\nthe rock of our salvation.\r\n\r\n95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a\r\njoyful noise unto him with psalms.\r\n\r\n95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.\r\n\r\n95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the\r\nhills is his also.\r\n\r\n95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry\r\nland.\r\n\r\n95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD\r\nour maker.\r\n\r\n95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the\r\nsheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,\r\n\r\n95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day\r\nof temptation in the wilderness:\r\n\r\n95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.\r\n\r\n95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,\r\nIt is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my\r\nways:\r\n\r\n95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from\r\nday to day.\r\n\r\n96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be\r\nfeared above all gods.\r\n\r\n96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the\r\nLORD glory and strength.\r\n\r\n96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an\r\noffering, and come into his courts.\r\n\r\n96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,\r\nall the earth.\r\n\r\n96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also\r\nshall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the\r\npeople righteously.\r\n\r\n96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea\r\nroar, and the fulness thereof.\r\n\r\n96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all\r\nthe trees of the wood rejoice\r\n\r\n96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the\r\nearth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people\r\nwith his truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of\r\nisles be glad thereof.\r\n\r\n97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and\r\njudgment are the habitation of his throne.\r\n\r\n97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.\r\n\r\n97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\n97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the\r\npresence of the Lord of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast\r\nthemselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.\r\n\r\n97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced\r\nbecause of thy judgments, O LORD.\r\n\r\n97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted\r\nfar above all gods.\r\n\r\n97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his\r\nsaints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.\r\n\r\n97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the\r\nremembrance of his holiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous\r\nthings: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.\r\n\r\n98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he\r\nopenly shewed in the sight of the heathen.\r\n\r\n98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of\r\nIsrael: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.\r\n\r\n98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud\r\nnoise, and rejoice, and sing praise.\r\n\r\n98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of\r\na psalm.\r\n\r\n98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the\r\nLORD, the King.\r\n\r\n98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they\r\nthat dwell therein.\r\n\r\n98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together\r\n\r\n98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with\r\nrighteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the\r\ncherubims; let the earth be moved.\r\n\r\n99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.\r\n\r\n99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.\r\n\r\n99:4 The king\xe2\x80\x99s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish\r\nequity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.\r\n\r\n99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he\r\nis holy.\r\n\r\n99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that\r\ncall upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.\r\n\r\n99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his\r\ntestimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.\r\n\r\n99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that\r\nforgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.\r\n\r\n99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the\r\nLORD our God is holy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.\r\n\r\n100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and\r\nnot we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.\r\n\r\n100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with\r\npraise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.\r\n\r\n100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth\r\nendureth to all generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I\r\nsing.\r\n\r\n101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou\r\ncome unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.\r\n\r\n101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of\r\nthem that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.\r\n\r\n101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him\r\nthat hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.\r\n\r\n101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may\r\ndwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.\r\n\r\n101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that\r\ntelleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.\r\n\r\n101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut\r\noff all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.\r\n\r\n102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;\r\nincline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.\r\n\r\n102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as\r\nan hearth.\r\n\r\n102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget\r\nto eat my bread.\r\n\r\n102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\n102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.\r\n\r\n102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad\r\nagainst me are sworn against me.\r\n\r\n102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\n102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast\r\nlifted me up, and cast me down.\r\n\r\n102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered\r\nlike grass.\r\n\r\n102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance\r\nunto all generations.\r\n\r\n102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to\r\nfavour her, yea, the set time, is come.\r\n\r\n102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the\r\ndust thereof.\r\n\r\n102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the\r\nkings of the earth thy glory.\r\n\r\n102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise\r\ntheir prayer.\r\n\r\n102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the\r\npeople which shall be created shall praise the LORD.\r\n\r\n102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from\r\nheaven did the LORD behold the earth;\r\n\r\n102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are\r\nappointed to death;\r\n\r\n102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in\r\nJerusalem;\r\n\r\n102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to\r\nserve the LORD.\r\n\r\n102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.\r\n\r\n102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy\r\nyears are throughout all generations.\r\n\r\n102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the\r\nheavens are the work of thy hands.\r\n\r\n102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them\r\nshall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and\r\nthey shall be changed:\r\n\r\n102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.\r\n\r\n102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed\r\nshall be established before thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his\r\nholy name.\r\n\r\n103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:\r\n\r\n103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy\r\ndiseases;\r\n\r\n103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with\r\nlovingkindness and tender mercies;\r\n\r\n103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is\r\nrenewed like the eagle\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are\r\noppressed.\r\n\r\n103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous\r\nin mercy.\r\n\r\n103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for\r\never.\r\n\r\n103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us\r\naccording to our iniquities.\r\n\r\n103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his\r\nmercy toward them that fear him.\r\n\r\n103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our\r\ntransgressions from us.\r\n\r\n103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them\r\nthat fear him.\r\n\r\n103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\r\n\r\n103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so\r\nhe flourisheth.\r\n\r\n103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place\r\nthereof shall know it no more.\r\n\r\n103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting\r\nupon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren;\r\n\r\n103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his\r\ncommandments to do them.\r\n\r\n103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his\r\nkingdom ruleth over all.\r\n\r\n103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do\r\nhis commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.\r\n\r\n103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that\r\ndo his pleasure.\r\n\r\n103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:\r\nbless the LORD, O my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;\r\nthou art clothed with honour and majesty.\r\n\r\n104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who\r\nstretchest out the heavens like a curtain:\r\n\r\n104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh\r\nthe clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:\r\n\r\n104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:\r\n\r\n104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be\r\nremoved for ever.\r\n\r\n104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters\r\nstood above the mountains.\r\n\r\n104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted\r\naway.\r\n\r\n104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto\r\nthe place which thou hast founded for them.\r\n\r\n104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they\r\nturn not again to cover the earth.\r\n\r\n104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses\r\nquench their thirst.\r\n\r\n104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,\r\nwhich sing among the branches.\r\n\r\n104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied\r\nwith the fruit of thy works.\r\n\r\n104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the\r\nservice of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;\r\n\r\n104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his\r\nface to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,\r\nwhich he hath planted;\r\n\r\n104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir\r\ntrees are her house.\r\n\r\n104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks\r\nfor the conies.\r\n\r\n104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts\r\nof the forest do creep forth.\r\n\r\n104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them\r\ndown in their dens.\r\n\r\n104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made\r\nthem all: the earth is full of thy riches.\r\n\r\n104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping\r\ninnumerable, both small and great beasts.\r\n\r\n104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast\r\nmade to play therein.\r\n\r\n104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat\r\nin due season.\r\n\r\n104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,\r\nthey are filled with good.\r\n\r\n104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their\r\nbreath, they die, and return to their dust.\r\n\r\n104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou\r\nrenewest the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall\r\nrejoice in his works.\r\n\r\n104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the\r\nhills, and they smoke.\r\n\r\n104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise\r\nto my God while I have my being.\r\n\r\n104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the\r\nwicked be no more.

Praise ye the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his\r\ndeeds among the people.\r\n\r\n105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that\r\nseek the LORD.\r\n\r\n105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.\r\n\r\n105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,\r\nand the judgments of his mouth;\r\n\r\n105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.\r\n\r\n105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he\r\ncommanded to a thousand generations.\r\n\r\n105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;\r\n\r\n105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for\r\nan everlasting covenant:\r\n\r\n105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of\r\nyour inheritance:\r\n\r\n105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and\r\nstrangers in it.\r\n\r\n105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to\r\nanother people;\r\n\r\n105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for\r\ntheir sakes;\r\n\r\n105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.\r\n\r\n105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the\r\nwhole staff of bread.\r\n\r\n105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a\r\nservant:\r\n\r\n105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:\r\n\r\n105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and\r\nlet him go free.\r\n\r\n105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:\r\n\r\n105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of\r\nHam.\r\n\r\n105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger\r\nthan their enemies.\r\n\r\n105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with\r\nhis servants.\r\n\r\n105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.\r\n\r\n105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of\r\nHam.\r\n\r\n105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not\r\nagainst his word.\r\n\r\n105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.\r\n\r\n105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of\r\ntheir kings.\r\n\r\n105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all\r\ntheir coasts.\r\n\r\n105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.\r\n\r\n105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the\r\ntrees of their coasts.\r\n\r\n105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that\r\nwithout number,\r\n\r\n105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the\r\nfruit of their ground.\r\n\r\n105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all\r\ntheir strength.\r\n\r\n105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was\r\nnot one feeble person among their tribes.\r\n\r\n105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them\r\nwith the bread of heaven.\r\n\r\n105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the\r\ndry places like a river.\r\n\r\n105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.\r\n\r\n105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with\r\ngladness:\r\n\r\n105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the\r\nlabour of the people;\r\n\r\n105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise\r\nye the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:\r\nfor his mercy endureth for ever.\r\n\r\n106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth\r\nall his praise?\r\n\r\n106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth\r\nrighteousness at all times.\r\n\r\n106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy\r\npeople: O visit me with thy salvation;\r\n\r\n106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the\r\ngladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.\r\n\r\n106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we\r\nhave done wickedly.\r\n\r\n106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered\r\nnot the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at\r\nthe Red sea.\r\n\r\n106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that he might\r\nmake his mighty power to be known.\r\n\r\n106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them\r\nthrough the depths, as through the wilderness.\r\n\r\n106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and\r\nredeemed them from the hand of the enemy.\r\n\r\n106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.\r\n\r\n106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:\r\n\r\n106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in\r\nthe desert.\r\n\r\n106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the\r\ncompany of Abiram.\r\n\r\n106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up\r\nthe wicked.\r\n\r\n106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.\r\n\r\n106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that\r\neateth grass.\r\n\r\n106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in\r\nEgypt;\r\n\r\n106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the\r\nRed sea.\r\n\r\n106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his\r\nchosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he\r\nshould destroy them.\r\n\r\n106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his\r\nword:\r\n\r\n106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them\r\nin the wilderness:\r\n\r\n106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter\r\nthem in the lands.\r\n\r\n106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the\r\nsacrifices of the dead.\r\n\r\n106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the\r\nplague brake in upon them.\r\n\r\n106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the\r\nplague was stayed.\r\n\r\n106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all\r\ngenerations for evermore.\r\n\r\n106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went\r\nill with Moses for their sakes:\r\n\r\n106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly\r\nwith his lips.\r\n\r\n106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD\r\ncommanded them:\r\n\r\n106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.\r\n\r\n106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.\r\n\r\n106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto\r\ndevils,\r\n\r\n106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of\r\ntheir daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and\r\nthe land was polluted with blood.\r\n\r\n106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring\r\nwith their own inventions.\r\n\r\n106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,\r\ninsomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.\r\n\r\n106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that\r\nhated them ruled over them.\r\n\r\n106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into\r\nsubjection under their hand.\r\n\r\n106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with\r\ntheir counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.\r\n\r\n106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their\r\ncry:\r\n\r\n106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according\r\nto the multitude of his mercies.\r\n\r\n106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them\r\ncaptives.\r\n\r\n106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,\r\nto give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.\r\n\r\n106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to\r\neverlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy\r\nendureth for ever.\r\n\r\n107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from\r\nthe hand of the enemy;\r\n\r\n107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the\r\nwest, from the north, and from the south.\r\n\r\n107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no\r\ncity to dwell in.\r\n\r\n107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.\r\n\r\n107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered\r\nthem out of their distresses.\r\n\r\n107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a\r\ncity of habitation.\r\n\r\n107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his\r\nwonderful works to the children of men!\r\n\r\n107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul\r\nwith goodness.\r\n\r\n107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound\r\nin affliction and iron;\r\n\r\n107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned\r\nthe counsel of the most High:\r\n\r\n107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell\r\ndown, and there was none to help.\r\n\r\n107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved\r\nthem out of their distresses.\r\n\r\n107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and\r\nbrake their bands in sunder.\r\n\r\n107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his\r\nwonderful works to the children of men!\r\n\r\n107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron\r\nin sunder.\r\n\r\n107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their\r\niniquities, are afflicted.\r\n\r\n107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near\r\nunto the gates of death.\r\n\r\n107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth\r\nthem out of their distresses.\r\n\r\n107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from\r\ntheir destructions.\r\n\r\n107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his\r\nwonderful works to the children of men!\r\n\r\n107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and\r\ndeclare his works with rejoicing.\r\n\r\n107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in\r\ngreat waters;\r\n\r\n107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.\r\n\r\n107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth\r\nup the waves thereof.\r\n\r\n107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:\r\ntheir soul is melted because of trouble.\r\n\r\n107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are\r\nat their wit\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\n\r\n107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth\r\nthem out of their distresses.\r\n\r\n107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them\r\nunto their desired haven.\r\n\r\n107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his\r\nwonderful works to the children of men!\r\n\r\n107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and\r\npraise him in the assembly of the elders.\r\n\r\n107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into\r\ndry ground;\r\n\r\n107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them\r\nthat dwell therein.\r\n\r\n107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground\r\ninto watersprings.\r\n\r\n107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare\r\na city for habitation;\r\n\r\n107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits\r\nof increase.\r\n\r\n107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and\r\nsuffereth not their cattle to decrease.\r\n\r\n107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,\r\naffliction, and sorrow.\r\n\r\n107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in\r\nthe wilderness, where there is no way.\r\n\r\n107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him\r\nfamilies like a flock.\r\n\r\n107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall\r\nstop her mouth.\r\n\r\n107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall\r\nunderstand the lovingkindness of the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with\r\nmy glory.\r\n\r\n108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.\r\n\r\n108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing\r\npraises unto thee among the nations.\r\n\r\n108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth\r\nunto the clouds.\r\n\r\n108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above\r\nall the earth;\r\n\r\n108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and\r\nanswer me.\r\n\r\n108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide\r\nShechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.\r\n\r\n108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength\r\nof mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;\r\n\r\n108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over\r\nPhilistia will I triumph.\r\n\r\n108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into\r\nEdom?\r\n\r\n108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,\r\nO God, go forth with our hosts?\r\n\r\n108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.\r\n\r\n108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall\r\ntread down our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;\r\n\r\n109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are\r\nopened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.\r\n\r\n109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought\r\nagainst me without a cause.\r\n\r\n109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.\r\n\r\n109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his\r\nprayer become sin.\r\n\r\n109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.\r\n\r\n109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.\r\n\r\n109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them\r\nseek their bread also out of their desolate places.\r\n\r\n109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the\r\nstrangers spoil his labour.\r\n\r\n109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there\r\nbe any to favour his fatherless children.\r\n\r\n109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following\r\nlet their name be blotted out.\r\n\r\n109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;\r\nand let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.\r\n\r\n109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off\r\nthe memory of them from the earth.\r\n\r\n109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted\r\nthe poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.\r\n\r\n109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted\r\nnot in blessing, so let it be far from him.\r\n\r\n109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so\r\nlet it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.\r\n\r\n109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a\r\ngirdle wherewith he is girded continually.\r\n\r\n109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and\r\nof them that speak evil against my soul.\r\n\r\n109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name\xe2\x80\x99s sake:\r\nbecause thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.\r\n\r\n109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.\r\n\r\n109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and\r\ndown as the locust.\r\n\r\n109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of\r\nfatness.\r\n\r\n109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me\r\nthey shaked their heads.\r\n\r\n109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:\r\n\r\n109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\n109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be\r\nashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.\r\n\r\n109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover\r\nthemselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.\r\n\r\n109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth;

seek thy servant; for I\r\ndo not forget thy commandments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.\r\n\r\n120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,\r\nthou false tongue?\r\n\r\n120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.\r\n\r\n120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents\r\nof Kedar!\r\n\r\n120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.\r\n\r\n120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee\r\nwill not slumber.\r\n\r\n121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.\r\n\r\n121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.\r\n\r\n121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve\r\nthy soul.\r\n\r\n121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from\r\nthis time forth, and even for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:\r\n\r\n122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the\r\ntestimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house\r\nof David.\r\n\r\n122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.\r\n\r\n122:8 For my brethren and companions\xe2\x80\x99 sakes, I will now say, Peace be\r\nwithin thee.\r\n\r\n122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\n123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their\r\nmasters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so\r\nour eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.\r\n\r\n123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are\r\nexceedingly filled with contempt.\r\n\r\n123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that\r\nare at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel\r\nsay;\r\n\r\n124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose\r\nup against us:\r\n\r\n124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was\r\nkindled against us:\r\n\r\n124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our\r\nsoul:\r\n\r\n124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.\r\n\r\n124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:\r\nthe snare is broken, and we are escaped.\r\n\r\n124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot\r\nbe removed, but abideth for ever.\r\n\r\n125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round\r\nabout his people from henceforth even for ever.\r\n\r\n125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the\r\nrighteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.\r\n\r\n125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are\r\nupright in their hearts.\r\n\r\n125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD\r\nshall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be\r\nupon Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like\r\nthem that dream.\r\n\r\n126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with\r\nsinging: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great\r\nthings for them.\r\n\r\n126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.\r\n\r\n126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.\r\n\r\n126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.\r\n\r\n126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall\r\ndoubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build\r\nit: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.\r\n\r\n127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the\r\nbread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.\r\n\r\n127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the\r\nwomb is his reward.\r\n\r\n127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of\r\nthe youth.\r\n\r\n127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall\r\nnot be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD;

nor he that bindeth\r\nsheaves his bosom.\r\n\r\n129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be\r\nupon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.\r\n\r\n130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of\r\nmy supplications.\r\n\r\n130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall\r\nstand?\r\n\r\n130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.\r\n\r\n130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the\r\nmorning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.\r\n\r\n130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,\r\nand with him is plenteous redemption.\r\n\r\n130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I\r\nexercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.\r\n\r\n131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is\r\nweaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.\r\n\r\n131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:\r\n\r\n132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of\r\nJacob;\r\n\r\n132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go\r\nup into my bed;\r\n\r\n132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,\r\n\r\n132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the\r\nmighty God of Jacob.\r\n\r\n132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his\r\nfootstool.\r\n\r\n132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.\r\n\r\n132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy\r\nsaints shout for joy.\r\n\r\n132:10 For thy servant David\xe2\x80\x99s sake turn not away the face of thine\r\nanointed.\r\n\r\n132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from\r\nit; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.\r\n\r\n132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I\r\nshall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\n132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\n132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired\r\nit.\r\n\r\n132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor\r\nwith bread.\r\n\r\n132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints\r\nshall shout aloud for joy.\r\n\r\n132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a\r\nlamp for mine anointed.\r\n\r\n132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall\r\nhis crown flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell\r\ntogether in unity!\r\n\r\n133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down\r\nupon the beard, even Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s beard: that went down to the skirts of\r\nhis garments;\r\n\r\n133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the\r\nmountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even\r\nlife for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n134:1 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by\r\nnight stand in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.\r\n\r\n134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him,\r\nO ye servants of the LORD.\r\n\r\n135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the\r\nhouse of our God.\r\n\r\n135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his\r\nname; for it is pleasant.\r\n\r\n135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his\r\npeculiar treasure.\r\n\r\n135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above\r\nall gods.\r\n\r\n135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in\r\nearth, in the seas, and all deep places.\r\n\r\n135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he\r\nmaketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his\r\ntreasuries.\r\n\r\n135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.\r\n\r\n135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,\r\nupon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.\r\n\r\n135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;\r\n\r\n135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the\r\nkingdoms of Canaan:\r\n\r\n135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\n135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever;

1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge\r\nand discretion.\r\n\r\n1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of\r\nunderstanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 To understand a\r\nproverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark\r\nsayings.\r\n\r\n1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools\r\ndespise wisdom and instruction.\r\n\r\n1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the\r\nlaw of thy mother: 1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy\r\nhead, and chains about thy neck.\r\n\r\n1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.\r\n\r\n1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk\r\nprivily for the innocent without cause: 1:12 Let us swallow them up\r\nalive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:\r\n1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses\r\nwith spoil: 1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:\r\n1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from\r\ntheir path: 1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.\r\n\r\n1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for\r\ntheir own lives.\r\n\r\n1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh\r\naway the life of the owners thereof.\r\n\r\n1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:\r\n1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of\r\nthe gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 1:22 How long,\r\nye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in\r\ntheir scorning, and fools hate knowledge?  1:23 Turn you at my\r\nreproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known\r\nmy words unto you.\r\n\r\n1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my\r\nhand, and no man regarded; 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my\r\ncounsel, and would none of my reproof: 1:26 I also will laugh at your\r\ncalamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 When your fear\r\ncometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when\r\ndistress and anguish cometh upon you.\r\n\r\n1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall\r\nseek me early, but they shall not find me: 1:29 For that they hated\r\nknowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 1:30 They would\r\nnone of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.\r\n\r\n1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be\r\nfilled with their own devices.\r\n\r\n1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the\r\nprosperity of fools shall destroy them.\r\n\r\n1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be\r\nquiet from fear of evil.\r\n\r\n2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments\r\nwith thee; 2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply\r\nthine heart to understanding; 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,\r\nand liftest up thy voice for understanding; 2:4 If thou seekest her as\r\nsilver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 Then shalt\r\nthou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.\r\n\r\n2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to\r\nthem that walk uprightly.\r\n\r\n2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his\r\nsaints.\r\n\r\n2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and\r\nequity; yea, every good path.\r\n\r\n2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant\r\nunto thy soul; 2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding\r\nshall keep thee: 2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,\r\nfrom the man that speaketh froward things; 2:13 Who leave the paths of\r\nuprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 Who rejoice to do\r\nevil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 2:15 Whose ways\r\nare crooked, and they froward in their paths: 2:16 To deliver thee\r\nfrom the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with\r\nher words; 2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth\r\nthe covenant of her God.\r\n\r\n2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.\r\n\r\n2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the\r\npaths of life.\r\n\r\n2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths\r\nof the righteous.\r\n\r\n2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall\r\nremain in it.\r\n\r\n2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the\r\ntransgressors shall be rooted out of it.\r\n\r\n3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my\r\ncommandments: 3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall\r\nthey add to thee.\r\n\r\n3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;\r\nwrite them upon the table of thine heart: 3:4 So shalt thou find\r\nfavour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.\r\n\r\n3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine\r\nown understanding.\r\n\r\n3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\r\n\r\n3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.\r\n\r\n3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of\r\nall thine increase: 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and\r\nthy presses shall burst out with new wine.\r\n\r\n3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary\r\nof his correction: 3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even\r\nas a father the son in whom he delighteth.\r\n\r\n3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of\r\nsilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.\r\n\r\n3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst\r\ndesire are not to be compared unto her.\r\n\r\n3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches\r\nand honour.\r\n\r\n3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\r\n\r\n3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy\r\nis every one that retaineth her.\r\n\r\n3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath\r\nhe established the heavens.\r\n\r\n3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop\r\ndown the dew.\r\n\r\n3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom\r\nand discretion: 3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to\r\nthy neck.\r\n\r\n3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not\r\nstumble.\r\n\r\n3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt\r\nlie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.\r\n\r\n3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the\r\nwicked, when it cometh.\r\n\r\n3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot\r\nfrom being taken.\r\n\r\n3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the\r\npower of thine hand to do it.\r\n\r\n3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I\r\nwill give; when thou hast it by thee.\r\n\r\n3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth\r\nsecurely by thee.\r\n\r\n3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.\r\n\r\n3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is\r\nwith the righteous.\r\n\r\n3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he\r\nblesseth the habitation of the just.\r\n\r\n3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the\r\nlowly.\r\n\r\n3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of\r\nfools.\r\n\r\n4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.\r\n\r\n4:3 For I was my father\xe2\x80\x99s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\n4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my\r\nwords: keep my commandments, and live.\r\n\r\n4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from\r\nthe words of my mouth.\r\n\r\n4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she\r\nshall keep thee.\r\n\r\n4:7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all\r\nthy getting get understanding.\r\n\r\n4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to\r\nhonour, when thou dost embrace her.\r\n\r\n4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of\r\nglory shall she deliver to thee.\r\n\r\n4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life\r\nshall be many.\r\n\r\n4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right\r\npaths.\r\n\r\n4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou\r\nrunnest, thou shalt not stumble.\r\n\r\n4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she\r\nis thy life.\r\n\r\n4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of\r\nevil men.\r\n\r\n4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.\r\n\r\n4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their\r\nsleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.\r\n\r\n4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth\r\nmore and more unto the perfect day.\r\n\r\n4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they\r\nstumble.\r\n\r\n4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.\r\n\r\n4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of\r\nthine heart.\r\n\r\n4:22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all\r\ntheir flesh.\r\n\r\n4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far\r\nfrom thee.\r\n\r\n4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight\r\nbefore thee.\r\n\r\n4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.\r\n\r\n4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my\r\nunderstanding: 5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy\r\nlips may keep knowledge.\r\n\r\n5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her\r\nmouth is smoother than oil: 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood,\r\nsharp as a two-edged sword.\r\n\r\n5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.\r\n\r\n5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are\r\nmoveable, that thou canst not know them.\r\n\r\n5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the\r\nwords of my mouth.\r\n\r\n5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her\r\nhouse: 5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto\r\nthe cruel: 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy\r\nlabours be in the house of a stranger; 5:11 And thou mourn at the\r\nlast, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 5:12 And say, How have\r\nI hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 5:13 And have not\r\nobeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that\r\ninstructed me!  5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the\r\ncongregation and assembly.\r\n\r\n5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of\r\nthine own well.\r\n\r\n5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers\xe2\x80\x99 with thee.\r\n\r\n5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n5:19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts\r\nsatisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.\r\n\r\n5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and\r\nembrace the bosom of a stranger?  5:21 For the ways of man are before\r\nthe eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.\r\n\r\n5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be\r\nholden with the cords of his sins.\r\n\r\n5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his\r\nfolly he shall go astray.\r\n\r\n6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken\r\nthy hand with a stranger, 6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thy\r\nmouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.\r\n\r\n6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into\r\nthe hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.\r\n\r\n6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.\r\n\r\n6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a\r\nbird from the hand of the fowler.\r\n\r\n6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 6:7\r\nWhich having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 6:8 Provideth her meat in\r\nthe summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.\r\n\r\n6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of\r\nthy sleep?  6:10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little\r\nfolding of the hands to sleep: 6:11 So shall thy poverty come as one\r\nthat travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.\r\n\r\n6:12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.\r\n\r\n6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth\r\nwith his fingers; 6:14 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth\r\nmischief continually; he soweth discord.\r\n\r\n6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be\r\nbroken without remedy.\r\n\r\n6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an\r\nabomination unto him: 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands\r\nthat shed innocent blood, 6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked\r\nimaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 6:19 A false\r\nwitness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.\r\n\r\n6:20 My son, keep thy father\xe2\x80\x99s commandment, and forsake not the law of\r\nthy mother: 6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them\r\nabout thy neck.\r\n\r\n6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall\r\nkeep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.\r\n\r\n6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs\r\nof instruction are the way of life: 6:24 To keep thee from the evil\r\nwoman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.\r\n\r\n6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take\r\nthee with her eyelids.\r\n\r\n6:26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of\r\nbread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.\r\n\r\n6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?\r\n6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  6:29 So\r\nhe that goeth in to his neighbours wife; whosoever toucheth her shall\r\nnot be innocent.\r\n\r\n6:30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when\r\nhe is hungry; 6:31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he\r\nshall give all the substance of his house.\r\n\r\n6:32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding:\r\nhe that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.\r\n\r\n6:33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be\r\nwiped away.\r\n\r\n6:34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in\r\nthe day of vengeance.\r\n\r\n6:35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,\r\nthough thou givest many gifts.\r\n\r\n7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.\r\n\r\n7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine\r\neye.\r\n\r\n7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy\r\nkinswoman: 7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from\r\nthe stranger which flattereth with her words.\r\n\r\n7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 7:7\r\nAnd beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a\r\nyoung man void of understanding, 7:8 Passing through the street near\r\nher corner; and he went the way to her house, 7:9 In the twilight, in\r\nthe evening, in the black and dark night: 7:10 And, behold, there met\r\nhim a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.\r\n\r\n7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 7:12\r\nNow is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every\r\ncorner.)  7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent\r\nface said unto him, 7:14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have\r\nI payed my vows.\r\n\r\n7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face,\r\nand I have found thee.\r\n\r\n7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved\r\nworks, with fine linen of Egypt.\r\n\r\n7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.\r\n\r\n7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us\r\nsolace ourselves with loves.\r\n\r\n7:19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 7:20\r\nHe hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\n7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the\r\nflattering of her lips she forced him.\r\n\r\n7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter,\r\nor as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 7:23 Till a dart strike\r\nthrough his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not\r\nthat it is for his life.\r\n\r\n7:24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the\r\nwords of my mouth.\r\n\r\n7:25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her\r\npaths.\r\n\r\n7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have\r\nbeen slain by her.\r\n\r\n7:27 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  8:2\r\nShe standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of\r\nthe paths.\r\n\r\n8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming\r\nin at the doors.\r\n\r\n8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.\r\n\r\n8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an\r\nunderstanding heart.\r\n\r\n8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my\r\nlips shall be right things.\r\n\r\n8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination\r\nto my lips.\r\n\r\n8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing\r\nfroward or perverse in them.\r\n\r\n8:9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them\r\nthat find knowledge.\r\n\r\n8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than\r\nchoice gold.\r\n\r\n8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be\r\ndesired are not to be compared to it.\r\n\r\n8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\n8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and\r\nthe evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.\r\n\r\n8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.\r\n\r\n8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.\r\n\r\n8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find\r\nme.\r\n\r\n8:18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue\r\nthan choice silver.\r\n\r\n8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of\r\njudgment: 8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit\r\nsubstance; and I will fill their treasures.\r\n\r\n8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his\r\nworks of old.\r\n\r\n8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the\r\nearth was.\r\n\r\n8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were\r\nno fountains abounding with water.\r\n\r\n8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought\r\nforth: 8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,\r\nnor the highest part of the dust of the world.\r\n\r\n8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass\r\nupon the face of the depth: 8:28 When he established the clouds above:\r\nwhen he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 8:29 When he gave to\r\nthe sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment:\r\nwhen he appointed the foundations of the earth: 8:30 Then I was by\r\nhim, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight,\r\nrejoicing always before him; 8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of\r\nhis earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.\r\n\r\n8:32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are\r\nthey that keep my ways.\r\n\r\n8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.\r\n\r\n8:34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,\r\nwaiting at the posts of my doors.\r\n\r\n8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they\r\nthat hate me love death.\r\n\r\n9:1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven\r\npillars: 9:2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;\r\nshe hath also furnished her table.\r\n\r\n9:3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest\r\nplaces of the city, 9:4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as\r\nfor him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 9:5 Come, eat of\r\nmy bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.\r\n\r\n9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.\r\n\r\n9:7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that\r\nrebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.\r\n\r\n9:8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and\r\nhe will love thee.\r\n\r\n9:9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a\r\njust man, and he will increase in learning.\r\n\r\n9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the\r\nknowledge of the holy is understanding.\r\n\r\n9:11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life\r\nshall be increased.\r\n\r\n9:12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou\r\nscornest, thou alone shalt bear it.\r\n\r\n9:13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.\r\n\r\n9:14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high\r\nplaces of the city, 9:15 To call passengers who go right on their\r\nways: 9:16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him\r\nthat wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 9:17 Stolen waters are\r\nsweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.\r\n\r\n9:18 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests\r\nare in the depths of hell.\r\n\r\n10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a\r\nfoolish son is the heaviness of his mother.\r\n\r\n10:2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness\r\ndelivereth from death.\r\n\r\n10:3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but\r\nhe casteth away the substance of the wicked.\r\n\r\n10:4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of\r\nthe diligent maketh rich.\r\n\r\n10:5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth\r\nin harvest is a son that causeth shame.\r\n\r\n10:6 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth\r\nthe mouth of the wicked.\r\n\r\n10:7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked\r\nshall rot.\r\n\r\n10:8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool\r\nshall fall.\r\n\r\n10:9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth\r\nhis ways shall be known.\r\n\r\n10:10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool\r\nshall fall.\r\n\r\n10:11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence\r\ncovereth the mouth of the wicked.\r\n\r\n10:12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.\r\n\r\n10:13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but\r\na rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.\r\n\r\n10:14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n10:15 The rich man\xe2\x80\x99s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the\r\npoor is their poverty.\r\n\r\n10:16 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the\r\nwicked to sin.\r\n\r\n10:17 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that\r\nrefuseth reproof erreth.\r\n\r\n10:18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a\r\nslander, is a fool.\r\n\r\n10:19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that\r\nrefraineth his lips is wise.\r\n\r\n10:20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the\r\nwicked is little worth.\r\n\r\n10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n10:22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no\r\nsorrow with it.\r\n\r\n10:23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of\r\nunderstanding hath wisdom.\r\n\r\n10:24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire\r\nof the righteous shall be granted.\r\n\r\n10:25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the\r\nrighteous is an everlasting foundation.\r\n\r\n10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the\r\nsluggard to them that send him.\r\n\r\n10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the\r\nwicked shall be shortened.\r\n\r\n10:28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation\r\nof the wicked shall perish.\r\n\r\n10:29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction\r\nshall be to the workers of iniquity.\r\n\r\n10:30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not\r\ninhabit the earth.\r\n\r\n10:31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward\r\ntongue shall be cut out.\r\n\r\n10:32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth\r\nof the wicked speaketh frowardness.\r\n\r\n11:1 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is\r\nhis delight.\r\n\r\n11:2 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n11:3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the\r\nperverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.\r\n\r\n11:4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness\r\ndelivereth from death.\r\n\r\n11:5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the\r\nwicked shall fall by his own wickedness.\r\n\r\n11:6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but\r\ntransgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.\r\n\r\n11:7 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the\r\nhope of unjust men perisheth.\r\n\r\n11:8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n11:9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through\r\nknowledge shall the just be delivered.\r\n\r\n11:10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and\r\nwhen the wicked perish, there is shouting.\r\n\r\n11:11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is\r\noverthrown by the mouth of the wicked.\r\n\r\n11:12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of\r\nunderstanding holdeth his peace.\r\n\r\n11:13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful\r\nspirit concealeth the matter.\r\n\r\n11:14 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of\r\ncounsellors there is safety.\r\n\r\n11:15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that\r\nhateth suretiship is sure.\r\n\r\n11:16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.\r\n\r\n11:17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is\r\ncruel troubleth his own flesh.\r\n\r\n11:18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth\r\nrighteousness shall be a sure reward.\r\n\r\n11:19 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil\r\npursueth it to his own death.\r\n\r\n11:20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:\r\nbut such as are upright in their way are his delight.\r\n\r\n11:21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:\r\nbut the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.\r\n\r\n11:22 As a jewel of gold in a swine\xe2\x80\x99s snout, so is a fair woman which\r\nis without discretion.\r\n\r\n11:23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of\r\nthe wicked is wrath.\r\n\r\n11:24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that\r\nwithholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\r\n\r\n11:25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall\r\nbe watered also himself.\r\n\r\n11:26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but\r\nblessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.\r\n\r\n11:27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that\r\nseeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.\r\n\r\n11:28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous\r\nshall flourish as a branch.\r\n\r\n11:29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the\r\nfool shall be servant to the wise of heart.\r\n\r\n11:30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that\r\nwinneth souls is wise.\r\n\r\n11:31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much\r\nmore the wicked and the sinner.\r\n\r\n12:1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth\r\nreproof is brutish.\r\n\r\n12:2 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked\r\ndevices will he condemn.\r\n\r\n12:3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the\r\nrighteous shall not be moved.\r\n\r\n12:4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh\r\nashamed is as rottenness in his bones.\r\n\r\n12:5 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the\r\nwicked are deceit.\r\n\r\n12:6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the\r\nmouth of the upright shall deliver them.\r\n\r\n12:7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the\r\nrighteous shall stand.\r\n\r\n12:8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is\r\nof a perverse heart shall be despised.\r\n\r\n12:9 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that\r\nhonoureth himself, and lacketh bread.\r\n\r\n12:10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender\r\nmercies of the wicked are cruel.\r\n\r\n12:11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he\r\nthat followeth vain persons is void of understanding.\r\n\r\n12:12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the\r\nrighteous yieldeth fruit.\r\n\r\n12:13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the\r\njust shall come out of trouble.\r\n\r\n12:14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:\r\nand the recompence of a man\xe2\x80\x99s hands shall be rendered unto him.\r\n\r\n12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that\r\nhearkeneth unto counsel is wise.\r\n\r\n12:16 A fool\xe2\x80\x99s wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n12:17 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false\r\nwitness deceit.\r\n\r\n12:18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the\r\ntongue of the wise is health.\r\n\r\n12:19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying\r\ntongue is but for a moment.\r\n\r\n12:20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the\r\ncounsellors of peace is joy.\r\n\r\n12:21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be\r\nfilled with mischief.\r\n\r\n12:22 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly\r\nare his delight.\r\n\r\n12:23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools\r\nproclaimeth foolishness.\r\n\r\n12:24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall\r\nbe under tribute.\r\n\r\n12:25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word\r\nmaketh it glad.\r\n\r\n12:26 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way\r\nof the wicked seduceth them.\r\n\r\n12:27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but\r\nthe substance of a diligent man is precious.\r\n\r\n12:28 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof\r\nthere is no death.\r\n\r\n13:1 A wise son heareth his father\xe2\x80\x99s instruction: but a scorner\r\nheareth not rebuke.\r\n\r\n13:2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of\r\nthe transgressors shall eat violence.\r\n\r\n13:3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth\r\nwide his lips shall have destruction.\r\n\r\n13:4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul\r\nof the diligent shall be made fat.\r\n\r\n13:5 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and\r\ncometh to shame.\r\n\r\n13:6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but\r\nwickedness overthroweth the sinner.\r\n\r\n13:7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is\r\nthat maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.\r\n\r\n13:8 The ransom of a man\xe2\x80\x99s life are his riches: but the poor heareth\r\nnot rebuke.\r\n\r\n13:9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked\r\nshall be put out.\r\n\r\n13:10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n13:11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that\r\ngathereth by labour shall increase.\r\n\r\n13:12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh,\r\nit is a tree of life.\r\n\r\n13:13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth\r\nthe commandment shall be rewarded.\r\n\r\n13:14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the\r\nsnares of death.\r\n\r\n13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors\r\nis hard.\r\n\r\n13:16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open\r\nhis folly.\r\n\r\n13:17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful\r\nambassador is health.\r\n\r\n13:18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but\r\nhe that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.\r\n\r\n13:19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is\r\nabomination to fools to depart from evil.\r\n\r\n13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of\r\nfools shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\n13:21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be\r\nrepayed.\r\n\r\n13:22 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children\xe2\x80\x99s children:\r\nand the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.\r\n\r\n13:23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is\r\ndestroyed for want of judgment.\r\n\r\n13:24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him\r\nchasteneth him betimes.\r\n\r\n13:25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the\r\nbelly of the wicked shall want.\r\n\r\n14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it\r\ndown with her hands.\r\n\r\n14:2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that\r\nis perverse in his ways despiseth him.\r\n\r\n14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of\r\nthe wise shall preserve them.\r\n\r\n14:4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the\r\nstrength of the ox.\r\n\r\n14:5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter\r\nlies.\r\n\r\n14:6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is\r\neasy unto him that understandeth.\r\n\r\n14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not\r\nin him the lips of knowledge.\r\n\r\n14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly\r\nof fools is deceit.\r\n\r\n14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n14:10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not\r\nintermeddle with his joy.\r\n\r\n14:11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle\r\nof the upright shall flourish.\r\n\r\n14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end\r\nthereof are the ways of death.\r\n\r\n14:13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that\r\nmirth is heaviness.\r\n\r\n14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a\r\ngood man shall be satisfied from himself.\r\n\r\n14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh\r\nwell to his going.\r\n\r\n14:16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool\r\nrageth, and is confident.\r\n\r\n14:17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked\r\ndevices is hated.\r\n\r\n14:18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n14:19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the\r\nrighteous.\r\n\r\n14:20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath\r\nmany friends.\r\n\r\n14:21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy\r\non the poor, happy is he.\r\n\r\n14:22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be\r\nto them that devise good.\r\n\r\n14:23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth\r\nonly to penury.\r\n\r\n14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of\r\nfools is folly.\r\n\r\n14:25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness\r\nspeaketh lies.\r\n\r\n14:26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children\r\nshall have a place of refuge.\r\n\r\n14:27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the\r\nsnares of death.\r\n\r\n14:28 In the multitude of people is the king\xe2\x80\x99s honour: but in the want\r\nof people is the destruction of the prince.\r\n\r\n14:29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that\r\nis hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\r\n\r\n14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness\r\nof the bones.\r\n\r\n14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that\r\nhonoureth him hath mercy on the poor.\r\n\r\n14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous\r\nhath hope in his death.\r\n\r\n14:33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but\r\nthat which is in the midst of fools is made known.\r\n\r\n14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n14:35 The king\xe2\x80\x99s favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is\r\nagainst him that causeth shame.\r\n\r\n15:1 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n15:2 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of\r\nfools poureth out foolishness.\r\n\r\n15:3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and\r\nthe good.\r\n\r\n15:4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is\r\na breach in the spirit.\r\n\r\n15:5 A fool despiseth his father\xe2\x80\x99s instruction: but he that regardeth\r\nreproof is prudent.\r\n\r\n15:6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the\r\nrevenues of the wicked is trouble.\r\n\r\n15:7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the\r\nfoolish doeth not so.\r\n\r\n15:8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but\r\nthe prayer of the upright is his delight.\r\n\r\n15:9 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he\r\nloveth him that followeth after righteousness.\r\n\r\n15:10 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he\r\nthat hateth reproof shall die.\r\n\r\n15:11 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the\r\nhearts of the children of men?  15:12 A scorner loveth not one that\r\nreproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.\r\n\r\n15:13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of\r\nthe heart the spirit is broken.\r\n\r\n15:14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but\r\nthe mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.\r\n\r\n15:15 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a\r\nmerry heart hath a continual feast.\r\n\r\n15:16 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure\r\nand trouble therewith.\r\n\r\n15:17 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and\r\nhatred therewith.\r\n\r\n15:18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger\r\nappeaseth strife.\r\n\r\n15:19 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the\r\nway of the righteous is made plain.\r\n\r\n15:20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n15:21 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of\r\nunderstanding walketh uprightly.\r\n\r\n15:22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude\r\nof counsellors they are established.\r\n\r\n15:23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in\r\ndue season, how good is it!  15:24 The way of life is above to the\r\nwise, that he may depart from hell beneath.\r\n\r\n15:25 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will\r\nestablish the border of the widow.\r\n\r\n15:26 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but\r\nthe words of the pure are pleasant words.\r\n\r\n15:27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that\r\nhateth gifts shall live.\r\n\r\n15:28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of\r\nthe wicked poureth out evil things.\r\n\r\n15:29 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of\r\nthe righteous.\r\n\r\n15:30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report\r\nmaketh the bones fat.\r\n\r\n15:31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.\r\n\r\n15:32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that\r\nheareth reproof getteth understanding.\r\n\r\n15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before\r\nhonour is humility.\r\n\r\n16:1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the\r\ntongue, is from the LORD.\r\n\r\n16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD\r\nweigheth the spirits.\r\n\r\n16:3 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n16:4 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked\r\nfor the day of evil.\r\n\r\n16:5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD:\r\nthough hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.\r\n\r\n16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the\r\nLORD men depart from evil.\r\n\r\n16:7 When a man\xe2\x80\x99s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to\r\nbe at peace with him.\r\n\r\n16:8 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without\r\nright.\r\n\r\n16:9 A man\xe2\x80\x99s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.\r\n\r\n16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth\r\ntransgresseth not in judgment.\r\n\r\n16:11 A just weight and balance are the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s: all the weights of the\r\nbag are his work.\r\n\r\n16:12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the\r\nthrone is established by righteousness.\r\n\r\n16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that\r\nspeaketh right.\r\n\r\n16:14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man\r\nwill pacify it.\r\n\r\n16:15 In the light of the king\xe2\x80\x99s countenance is life; and his favour\r\nis as a cloud of the latter rain.\r\n\r\n16:16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get\r\nunderstanding rather to be chosen than silver!  16:17 The highway of\r\nthe upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\n16:18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n16:19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to\r\ndivide the spoil with the proud.\r\n\r\n16:20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso\r\ntrusteth in the LORD, happy is he.\r\n\r\n16:21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of\r\nthe lips increaseth learning.\r\n\r\n16:22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but\r\nthe instruction of fools is folly.\r\n\r\n16:23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n16:24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and\r\nhealth to the bones.\r\n\r\n16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end\r\nthereof are the ways of death.\r\n\r\n16:26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth\r\nit of him.\r\n\r\n16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a\r\nburning fire.\r\n\r\n16:28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n16:29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the\r\nway that is not good.\r\n\r\n16:30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips\r\nhe bringeth evil to pass.\r\n\r\n16:31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n16:32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that\r\nruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.\r\n\r\n16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n17:1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house\r\nfull of sacrifices with strife.\r\n\r\n17:2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and\r\nshall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.\r\n\r\n17:3 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the\r\nLORD trieth the hearts.\r\n\r\n17:4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to\r\na naughty tongue.\r\n\r\n17:5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad\r\nat calamities shall not be unpunished.\r\n\r\n17:6 Children\xe2\x80\x99s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of\r\nchildren are their fathers.\r\n\r\n17:7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a\r\nprince.\r\n\r\n17:8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:\r\nwhithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.\r\n\r\n17:9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that\r\nrepeateth a matter separateth very friends.\r\n\r\n17:10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes\r\ninto a fool.\r\n\r\n17:11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger\r\nshall be sent against him.\r\n\r\n17:12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool\r\nin his folly.\r\n\r\n17:13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n17:14 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:\r\ntherefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.\r\n\r\n17:15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just,\r\neven they both are abomination to the LORD.\r\n\r\n17:16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,\r\nseeing he hath no heart to it?  17:17 A friend loveth at all times,\r\nand a brother is born for adversity.\r\n\r\n17:18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety\r\nin the presence of his friend.\r\n\r\n17:19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth\r\nhis gate seeketh destruction.\r\n\r\n17:20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a\r\nperverse tongue falleth into mischief.\r\n\r\n17:21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father\r\nof a fool hath no joy.\r\n\r\n17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit\r\ndrieth the bones.\r\n\r\n17:23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways\r\nof judgment.\r\n\r\n17:24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a\r\nfool are in the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her\r\nthat bare him.\r\n\r\n17:26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for\r\nequity.\r\n\r\n17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of\r\nunderstanding is of an excellent spirit.\r\n\r\n17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he\r\nthat shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.\r\n\r\n18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and\r\nintermeddleth with all wisdom.\r\n\r\n18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may\r\ndiscover itself.\r\n\r\n18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with\r\nignominy reproach.\r\n\r\n18:4 The words of a man\xe2\x80\x99s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring\r\nof wisdom as a flowing brook.\r\n\r\n18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow\r\nthe righteous in judgment.\r\n\r\n18:6 A fool\xe2\x80\x99s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for\r\nstrokes.\r\n\r\n18:7 A fool\xe2\x80\x99s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of\r\nhis soul.\r\n\r\n18:8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into\r\nthe innermost parts of the belly.\r\n\r\n18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a\r\ngreat waster.\r\n\r\n18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth\r\ninto it, and is safe.\r\n\r\n18:11 The rich man\xe2\x80\x99s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in\r\nhis own conceit.\r\n\r\n18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before\r\nhonour is humility.\r\n\r\n18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and\r\nshame unto him.\r\n\r\n18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded\r\nspirit who can bear?  18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth\r\nknowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\r\n\r\n18:16 A man\xe2\x80\x99s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his\r\nneighbour cometh and searcheth him.\r\n\r\n18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the\r\nmighty.\r\n\r\n18:19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and\r\ntheir contentions are like the bars of a castle.\r\n\r\n18:20 A man\xe2\x80\x99s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;\r\nand with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.\r\n\r\n18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that\r\nlove it shall eat the fruit thereof.\r\n\r\n18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.\r\n\r\n18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is\r\na friend that sticketh closer than a brother.\r\n\r\n19:1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is\r\nperverse in his lips, and is a fool.\r\n\r\n19:2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he\r\nthat hasteth with his feet sinneth.\r\n\r\n19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth\r\nagainst the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\n19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh\r\nlies shall not escape.\r\n\r\n19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a\r\nfriend to him that giveth gifts.\r\n\r\n19:7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his\r\nfriends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are\r\nwanting to him.\r\n\r\n19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth\r\nunderstanding shall find good.\r\n\r\n19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh\r\nlies shall perish.\r\n\r\n19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to\r\nhave rule over princes.\r\n\r\n19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory\r\nto pass over a transgression.\r\n\r\n19:12 The king\xe2\x80\x99s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is\r\nas dew upon the grass.\r\n\r\n19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions\r\nof a wife are a continual dropping.\r\n\r\n19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent\r\nwife is from the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall\r\nsuffer hunger.\r\n\r\n19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he\r\nthat despiseth his ways shall die.\r\n\r\n19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that\r\nwhich he hath given will he pay him again.\r\n\r\n19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare\r\nfor his crying.\r\n\r\n19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou\r\ndeliver him, yet thou must do it again.\r\n\r\n19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise\r\nin thy latter end.\r\n\r\n19:21 There are many devices in a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart; nevertheless the\r\ncounsel of the LORD, that shall stand.\r\n\r\n19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better\r\nthan a liar.\r\n\r\n19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall\r\nabide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.\r\n\r\n19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so\r\nmuch as bring it to his mouth again.\r\n\r\n19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one\r\nthat hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.\r\n\r\n19:26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a\r\nson that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.\r\n\r\n19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from\r\nthe words of knowledge.\r\n\r\n19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the\r\nwicked devoureth iniquity.\r\n\r\n19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of\r\nfools.\r\n\r\n20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is\r\ndeceived thereby is not wise.\r\n\r\n20:2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh\r\nhim to anger sinneth against his own soul.\r\n\r\n20:3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool\r\nwill be meddling.\r\n\r\n20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall\r\nhe beg in harvest, and have nothing.\r\n\r\n20:5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of\r\nunderstanding will draw it out.\r\n\r\n20:6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful\r\nman who can find?  20:7 The just man walketh in his integrity: his\r\nchildren are blessed after him.\r\n\r\n20:8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all\r\nevil with his eyes.\r\n\r\n20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?\r\n20:10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike\r\nabomination to the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,\r\nand whether it be right.\r\n\r\n20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even\r\nboth of them.\r\n\r\n20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and\r\nthou shalt be satisfied with bread.\r\n\r\n20:14 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone\r\nhis way, then he boasteth.\r\n\r\n20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of\r\nknowledge are a precious jewel.\r\n\r\n20:16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a\r\npledge of him for a strange woman.\r\n\r\n20:17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth\r\nshall be filled with gravel.\r\n\r\n20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice\r\nmake war.\r\n\r\n20:19 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore\r\nmeddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.\r\n\r\n20:20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put\r\nout in obscure darkness.\r\n\r\n20:21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the\r\nend thereof shall not be blessed.\r\n\r\n20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and\r\nhe shall save thee.\r\n\r\n20:23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false\r\nbalance is not good.\r\n\r\n20:24 Man\xe2\x80\x99s goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his\r\nown way?  20:25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is\r\nholy, and after vows to make enquiry.\r\n\r\n20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the\r\ninward parts of the belly.\r\n\r\n20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n20:29 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old\r\nmen is the grey head.\r\n\r\n20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the\r\ninward parts of the belly.\r\n\r\n21:1 The king\xe2\x80\x99s heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of\r\nwater: he turneth it whithersoever he will.\r\n\r\n21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD\r\npondereth the hearts.\r\n\r\n21:3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n21:4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked,\r\nis sin.\r\n\r\n21:5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of\r\nevery one that is hasty only to want.\r\n\r\n21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to\r\nand fro of them that seek death.\r\n\r\n21:7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse\r\nto do judgment.\r\n\r\n21:8 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his\r\nwork is right.\r\n\r\n21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a\r\nbrawling woman in a wide house.\r\n\r\n21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no\r\nfavour in his eyes.\r\n\r\n21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when\r\nthe wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.\r\n\r\n21:12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:\r\nbut God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.\r\n\r\n21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall\r\ncry himself, but shall not be heard.\r\n\r\n21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom\r\nstrong wrath.\r\n\r\n21:15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be\r\nto the workers of iniquity.\r\n\r\n21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall\r\nremain in the congregation of the dead.\r\n\r\n21:17 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine\r\nand oil shall not be rich.\r\n\r\n21:18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the\r\ntransgressor for the upright.\r\n\r\n21:19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious\r\nand an angry woman.\r\n\r\n21:20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the\r\nwise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.\r\n\r\n21:21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,\r\nrighteousness, and honour.\r\n\r\n21:22 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the\r\nstrength of the confidence thereof.\r\n\r\n21:23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n21:24 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\n21:25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n21:26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth\r\nand spareth not.\r\n\r\n21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when\r\nhe bringeth it with a wicked mind?  21:28 A false witness shall\r\nperish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.\r\n\r\n21:29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he\r\ndirecteth his way.\r\n\r\n21:30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n21:31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is\r\nof the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:1 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving\r\nfavour rather than silver and gold.\r\n\r\n22:2 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n22:3 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the\r\nsimple pass on, and are punished.\r\n\r\n22:4 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n22:5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth\r\nkeep his soul shall be far from them.\r\n\r\n22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he\r\nwill not depart from it.\r\n\r\n22:7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the\r\nlender.\r\n\r\n22:8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his\r\nanger shall fail.\r\n\r\n22:9 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of\r\nhis bread to the poor.\r\n\r\n22:10 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife\r\nand reproach shall cease.\r\n\r\n22:11 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the\r\nking shall be his friend.\r\n\r\n22:12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the\r\nwords of the transgressor.\r\n\r\n22:13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be\r\nslain in the streets.\r\n\r\n22:14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of\r\nthe LORD shall fall therein.\r\n\r\n22:15 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of\r\ncorrection shall drive it far from him.\r\n\r\n22:16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that\r\ngiveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.\r\n\r\n22:17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply\r\nthine heart unto my knowledge.\r\n\r\n22:18 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they\r\nshall withal be fitted in thy lips.\r\n\r\n22:19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee\r\nthis day, even to thee.\r\n\r\n22:20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and\r\nknowledge, 22:21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the\r\nwords of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them\r\nthat send unto thee?  22:22 Rob not the poor, because he is poor:\r\nneither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 22:23 For the LORD will\r\nplead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.\r\n\r\n22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man\r\nthou shalt not go: 22:25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to\r\nthy soul.\r\n\r\n22:26 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are\r\nsureties for debts.\r\n\r\n22:27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed\r\nfrom under thee?  22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy\r\nfathers have set.\r\n\r\n22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before\r\nkings; he shall not stand before mean men.\r\n\r\n23:1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what\r\nis before thee: 23:2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man\r\ngiven to appetite.\r\n\r\n23:3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.\r\n\r\n23:4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.\r\n\r\n23:5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches\r\ncertainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n23:6 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither\r\ndesire thou his dainty meats: 23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so\r\nis he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n23:8 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose\r\nthy sweet words.\r\n\r\n23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom\r\nof thy words.\r\n\r\n23:10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of\r\nthe fatherless: 23:11 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead\r\ntheir cause with thee.\r\n\r\n23:12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words\r\nof knowledge.\r\n\r\n23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him\r\nwith the rod, he shall not die.\r\n\r\n23:14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul\r\nfrom hell.\r\n\r\n23:15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n23:16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.\r\n\r\n23:17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the\r\nLORD all the day long.\r\n\r\n23:18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\n23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: 23:21\r\nFor the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness\r\nshall clothe a man with rags.\r\n\r\n23:22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy\r\nmother when she is old.\r\n\r\n23:23 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,\r\nand understanding.\r\n\r\n23:24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that\r\nbegetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.\r\n\r\n23:25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee\r\nshall rejoice.\r\n\r\n23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.\r\n\r\n23:27 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow\r\npit.\r\n\r\n23:28 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the\r\ntransgressors among men.\r\n\r\n23:29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath\r\nbabbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?\r\n23:30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his\r\ncolour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.\r\n\r\n23:32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an\r\nadder.\r\n\r\n23:33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall\r\nutter perverse things.\r\n\r\n23:34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the\r\nsea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.\r\n\r\n23:35 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they\r\nhave beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it\r\nyet again.\r\n\r\n24:1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n24:2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\n24:3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is\r\nestablished: 24:4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with\r\nall precious and pleasant riches.\r\n\r\n24:5 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n24:6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of\r\ncounsellors there is safety.\r\n\r\n24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n24:8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.\r\n\r\n24:9 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an\r\nabomination to men.\r\n\r\n24:10 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.\r\n\r\n24:11 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and\r\nthose that are ready to be slain; 24:12 If thou sayest, Behold, we\r\nknew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he\r\nthat keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to\r\nevery man according to his works?  24:13 My son, eat thou honey,\r\nbecause it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:\r\n24:14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou\r\nhast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall\r\nnot be cut off.\r\n\r\n24:15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the\r\nrighteous; spoil not his resting place: 24:16 For a just man falleth\r\nseven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\n24:17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be\r\nglad when he stumbleth: 24:18 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease\r\nhim, and he turn away his wrath from him.\r\n\r\n24:19 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at\r\nthe wicked: 24:20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the\r\ncandle of the wicked shall be put out.\r\n\r\n24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with\r\nthem that are given to change: 24:22 For their calamity shall rise\r\nsuddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?  24:23 These things\r\nalso belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the\r\npeople curse, nations shall abhor him: 24:25 But to them that rebuke\r\nhim shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.\r\n\r\n24:26 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.\r\n\r\n24:27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the\r\nfield; and afterwards build thine house.\r\n\r\n24:28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and\r\ndeceive not with thy lips.\r\n\r\n24:29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will\r\nrender to the man according to his work.\r\n\r\n24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the\r\nman void of understanding; 24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over with\r\nthorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall\r\nthereof was broken down.\r\n\r\n24:32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and\r\nreceived instruction.\r\n\r\n24:33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the\r\nhands to sleep: 24:34 So shall thy poverty come as one that\r\ntravelleth; and thy want as an armed man.\r\n\r\n25:1 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah\r\nking of Judah copied out.\r\n\r\n25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of\r\nkings is to search out a matter.\r\n\r\n25:3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of\r\nkings is unsearchable.\r\n\r\n25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a\r\nvessel for the finer.\r\n\r\n25:5 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall\r\nbe established in righteousness.\r\n\r\n25:6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not\r\nin the place of great men: 25:7 For better it is that it be said unto\r\nthee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the\r\npresence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.\r\n\r\n25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in\r\nthe end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.\r\n\r\n25:9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a\r\nsecret to another: 25:10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame,\r\nand thine infamy turn not away.\r\n\r\n25:11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n25:12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a\r\nwise reprover upon an obedient ear.\r\n\r\n25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful\r\nmessenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n25:14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind\r\nwithout rain.\r\n\r\n25:15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue\r\nbreaketh the bone.\r\n\r\n25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,\r\nlest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.\r\n\r\n25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbours house; lest he be weary\r\nof thee, and so hate thee.\r\n\r\n25:18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a\r\nmaul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.\r\n\r\n25:19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a\r\nbroken tooth, and a foot out of joint.\r\n\r\n25:20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar\r\nupon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.\r\n\r\n25:21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be\r\nthirsty, give him water to drink: 25:22 For thou shalt heap coals of\r\nfire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.\r\n\r\n25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a\r\nbackbiting tongue.\r\n\r\n25:24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a\r\nbrawling woman and in a wide house.\r\n\r\n25:25 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n25:26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled\r\nfountain, and a corrupt spring.\r\n\r\n25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own\r\nglory is not glory.\r\n\r\n25:28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is\r\nbroken down, and without walls.\r\n\r\n26:1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not\r\nseemly for a fool.\r\n\r\n26:2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse\r\ncauseless shall not come.\r\n\r\n26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\n26:4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\n26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own\r\nconceit.\r\n\r\n26:6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the\r\nfeet, and drinketh damage.\r\n\r\n26:7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth\r\nof fools.\r\n\r\n26:8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth\r\nhonour to a fool.\r\n\r\n26:9 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable\r\nin the mouths of fools.\r\n\r\n26:10 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,\r\nand rewardeth transgressors.\r\n\r\n26:11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\n26:12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of\r\na fool than of him.\r\n\r\n26:13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n26:14 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon\r\nhis bed.\r\n\r\n26:15 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to\r\nbring it again to his mouth.\r\n\r\n26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can\r\nrender a reason.\r\n\r\n26:17 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to\r\nhim, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.\r\n\r\n26:18 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 26:19 So\r\nis the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?\r\n26:20 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no\r\ntalebearer, the strife ceaseth.\r\n\r\n26:21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a\r\ncontentious man to kindle strife.\r\n\r\n26:22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into\r\nthe innermost parts of the belly.\r\n\r\n26:23 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with\r\nsilver dross.\r\n\r\n26:24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit\r\nwithin him; 26:25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there\r\nare seven abominations in his heart.\r\n\r\n26:26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be\r\nshewed before the whole congregation.\r\n\r\n26:27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a\r\nstone, it will return upon him.\r\n\r\n26:28 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a\r\nflattering mouth worketh ruin.\r\n\r\n27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day\r\nmay bring forth.\r\n\r\n27:2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger,\r\nand not thine own lips.\r\n\r\n27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool\xe2\x80\x99s wrath is\r\nheavier than them both.\r\n\r\n27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand\r\nbefore envy?  27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.\r\n\r\n27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy\r\nare deceitful.\r\n\r\n27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every\r\nbitter thing is sweet.\r\n\r\n27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that\r\nwandereth from his place.\r\n\r\n27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s friend by hearty counsel.\r\n\r\n27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father\xe2\x80\x99s friend, forsake not; neither\r\ngo into thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is\r\na neighbour that is near than a brother far off.\r\n\r\n27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him\r\nthat reproacheth me.\r\n\r\n27:12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the\r\nsimple pass on, and are punished.\r\n\r\n27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a\r\npledge of him for a strange woman.\r\n\r\n27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in\r\nthe morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.\r\n\r\n27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman\r\nare alike.\r\n\r\n27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his\r\nright hand, which bewrayeth itself.\r\n\r\n27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he\r\nthat waiteth on his master shall be honoured.\r\n\r\n27:19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.\r\n\r\n27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are\r\nnever satisfied.\r\n\r\n27:21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a\r\nman to his praise.\r\n\r\n27:22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a\r\npestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.\r\n\r\n27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well\r\nto thy herds.\r\n\r\n27:24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every\r\ngeneration?  27:25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth\r\nitself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.\r\n\r\n27:26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n27:27 And thou shalt have goats\xe2\x80\x99 milk enough for thy food, for the\r\nfood of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.\r\n\r\n28:1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold\r\nas a lion.\r\n\r\n28:2 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but\r\nby a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\n28:3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which\r\nleaveth no food.\r\n\r\n28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the\r\nlaw contend with them.\r\n\r\n28:5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD\r\nunderstand all things.\r\n\r\n28:6 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that\r\nis perverse in his ways, though he be rich.\r\n\r\n28:7 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion\r\nof riotous men shameth his father.\r\n\r\n28:8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he\r\nshall gather it for him that will pity the poor.\r\n\r\n28:9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his\r\nprayer shall be abomination.\r\n\r\n28:10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he\r\nshall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good\r\nthings in possession.\r\n\r\n28:11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath\r\nunderstanding searcheth him out.\r\n\r\n28:12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when\r\nthe wicked rise, a man is hidden.\r\n\r\n28:13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso\r\nconfesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.\r\n\r\n28:14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his\r\nheart shall fall into mischief.\r\n\r\n28:15 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over\r\nthe poor people.\r\n\r\n28:16 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor:\r\nbut he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.\r\n\r\n28:17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee\r\nto the pit; let no man stay him.\r\n\r\n28:18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse\r\nin his ways shall fall at once.\r\n\r\n28:19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that\r\nfolloweth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.\r\n\r\n28:20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh\r\nhaste to be rich shall not be innocent.\r\n\r\n28:21 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread\r\nthat man will transgress.\r\n\r\n28:22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not\r\nthat poverty shall come upon him.\r\n\r\n28:23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he\r\nthat flattereth with the tongue.\r\n\r\n28:24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no\r\ntransgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.\r\n\r\n28:25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that\r\nputteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.\r\n\r\n28:26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh\r\nwisely, he shall be delivered.\r\n\r\n28:27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth\r\nhis eyes shall have many a curse.\r\n\r\n28:28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish,\r\nthe righteous increase.\r\n\r\n29:1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly\r\nbe destroyed, and that without remedy.\r\n\r\n29:2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when\r\nthe wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.\r\n\r\n29:3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth\r\ncompany with harlots spendeth his substance.\r\n\r\n29:4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth\r\ngifts overthroweth it.\r\n\r\n29:5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.\r\n\r\n29:6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the\r\nrighteous doth sing and rejoice.\r\n\r\n29:7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked\r\nregardeth not to know it.\r\n\r\n29:8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\n29:9 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or\r\nlaugh, there is no rest.\r\n\r\n29:10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.\r\n\r\n29:11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n29:12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.\r\n\r\n29:13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD\r\nlighteneth both their eyes.\r\n\r\n29:14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be\r\nestablished for ever.\r\n\r\n29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself\r\nbringeth his mother to shame.\r\n\r\n29:16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but\r\nthe righteous shall see their fall.\r\n\r\n29:17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give\r\ndelight unto thy soul.\r\n\r\n29:18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth\r\nthe law, happy is he.\r\n\r\n29:19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he\r\nunderstand he will not answer.\r\n\r\n29:20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope\r\nof a fool than of him.\r\n\r\n29:21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall\r\nhave him become his son at the length.\r\n\r\n29:22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in\r\ntransgression.\r\n\r\n29:23 A man\xe2\x80\x99s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the\r\nhumble in spirit.\r\n\r\n29:24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth\r\ncursing, and bewrayeth it not.\r\n\r\n29:25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in\r\nthe LORD shall be safe.\r\n\r\n29:26 Many seek the ruler\xe2\x80\x99s favour; but every man\xe2\x80\x99s judgment cometh\r\nfrom the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is\r\nupright in the way is abomination to the wicked.\r\n\r\n30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man\r\nspake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 30:2 Surely I am more\r\nbrutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.\r\n\r\n30:3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.\r\n\r\n30:4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered\r\nthe wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who\r\nhath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what\r\nis his son\xe2\x80\x99s name, if thou canst tell?  30:5 Every word of God is\r\npure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.\r\n\r\n30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be\r\nfound a liar.\r\n\r\n30:7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I\r\ndie: 30:8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty\r\nnor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 30:9 Lest I be full,\r\nand deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal,\r\nand take the name of my God in vain.\r\n\r\n30:10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and\r\nthou be found guilty.\r\n\r\n30:11 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not\r\nbless their mother.\r\n\r\n30:12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet\r\nis not washed from their filthiness.\r\n\r\n30:13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their\r\neyelids are lifted up.\r\n\r\n30:14 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw\r\nteeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy\r\nfrom among men.\r\n\r\n30:15 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are\r\nthree things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is\r\nenough: 30:16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not\r\nfilled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.\r\n\r\n30:17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his\r\nmother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young\r\neagles shall eat it.\r\n\r\n30:18 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four\r\nwhich I know not: 30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a\r\nserpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and\r\nthe way of a man with a maid.\r\n\r\n30:20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth\r\nher mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.\r\n\r\n30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it\r\ncannot bear: 30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he\r\nis filled with meat; 30:23 For an odious woman when she is married;\r\nand an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.\r\n\r\n30:24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they\r\nare exceeding wise: 30:25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they\r\nprepare their meat in the summer; 30:26 The conies are but a feeble\r\nfolk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 30:27 The locusts have\r\nno king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 30:28 The spider\r\ntaketh hold with her hands, and is in kings\xe2\x80\x99 palaces.\r\n\r\n30:29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in\r\ngoing: 30:30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not\r\naway for any; 30:31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against\r\nwhom there is no rising up.\r\n\r\n30:32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou\r\nhast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.\r\n\r\n30:33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the\r\nwringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath\r\nbringeth forth strife.\r\n\r\n31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n31:2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of\r\nmy vows?  31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that\r\nwhich destroyeth kings.\r\n\r\n31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;\r\nnor for princes strong drink: 31:5 Lest they drink, and forget the\r\nlaw, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.\r\n\r\n31:6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto\r\nthose that be of heavy hearts.\r\n\r\n31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n31:8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are\r\nappointed to destruction.\r\n\r\n31:9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the\r\npoor and needy.\r\n\r\n31:10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above\r\nrubies.\r\n\r\n31:11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he\r\nshall have no need of spoil.\r\n\r\n31:12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.\r\n\r\n31:13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n31:14 She is like the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 ships; she bringeth her food from\r\nafar.\r\n\r\n31:15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her\r\nhousehold, and a portion to her maidens.\r\n\r\n31:16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her\r\nhands she planteth a vineyard.\r\n\r\n31:17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.\r\n\r\n31:18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth\r\nnot out by night.\r\n\r\n31:19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the\r\ndistaff.\r\n\r\n31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth\r\nher hands to the needy.\r\n\r\n31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her\r\nhousehold are clothed with scarlet.\r\n\r\n31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk\r\nand purple.\r\n\r\n31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the\r\nelders of the land.\r\n\r\n31:24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles\r\nunto the merchant.\r\n\r\n31:25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law\r\nof kindness.\r\n\r\n31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not\r\nthe bread of idleness.\r\n\r\n31:28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,\r\nand he praiseth her.\r\n\r\n31:29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n31:30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that\r\nfeareth the LORD, she shall be praised.\r\n\r\n31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise\r\nher in the gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEcclesiastes\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nThe Preacher\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\n1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the\r\nsun?  1:4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:\r\nbut the earth abideth for ever.\r\n\r\n1:5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his\r\nplace where he arose.\r\n\r\n1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;\r\nit whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according\r\nto his circuits.\r\n\r\n1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the\r\nplace from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.\r\n\r\n1:8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not\r\nsatisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.\r\n\r\n1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that\r\nwhich is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing\r\nunder the sun.\r\n\r\n1:10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it\r\nhath been already of old time, which was before us.\r\n\r\n1:11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be\r\nany remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n1:12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning\r\nall things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God\r\ngiven to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.\r\n\r\n1:14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,\r\nbehold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n1:15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is\r\nwanting cannot be numbered.\r\n\r\n1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great\r\nestate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been\r\nbefore me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom\r\nand knowledge.\r\n\r\n1:17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and\r\nfolly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n1:18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth\r\nknowledge increaseth sorrow.\r\n\r\n2:1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,\r\ntherefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.\r\n\r\n2:2 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?  2:3 I\r\nsought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine\r\nheart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was\r\nthat good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven\r\nall the days of their life.\r\n\r\n2:4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me\r\nvineyards: 2:5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in\r\nthem of all kind of fruits: 2:6 I made me pools of water, to water\r\ntherewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 2:7 I got me servants\r\nand maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great\r\npossessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem\r\nbefore me: 2:8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar\r\ntreasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women\r\nsingers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments,\r\nand that of all sorts.\r\n\r\n2:9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in\r\nJerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.\r\n\r\n2:10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld\r\nnot my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and\r\nthis was my portion of all my labour.\r\n\r\n2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on\r\nthe labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.\r\n\r\n2:12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for\r\nwhat can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath\r\nbeen already done.\r\n\r\n2:13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n2:14 The wise man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in\r\ndarkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n2:15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it\r\nhappeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my\r\nheart, that this also is vanity.\r\n\r\n2:16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for\r\never; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAnd how dieth the wise man? as the fool.\r\n\r\n2:17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under\r\nthe sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n2:18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:\r\nbecause I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.\r\n\r\n2:19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet\r\nshall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and\r\nwherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.\r\n\r\n2:20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the\r\nlabour which I took under the sun.\r\n\r\n2:21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,\r\nand in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he\r\nleave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.\r\n\r\n2:22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his\r\nheart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  2:23 For all his days\r\nare sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in\r\nthe night. This is also vanity.\r\n\r\n2:24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and\r\ndrink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This\r\nalso I saw, that it was from the hand of God.\r\n\r\n2:25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?\r\n2:26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and\r\nknowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and\r\nto heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also\r\nis vanity and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n3:1 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose\r\nunder the heaven: 3:2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to\r\nplant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 3:3 A time to\r\nkill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build\r\nup; 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a\r\ntime to dance; 3:5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather\r\nstones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from\r\nembracing; 3:6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and\r\na time to cast away; 3:7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to\r\nkeep silence, and a time to speak; 3:8 A time to love, and a time to\r\nhate; a time of war, and a time of peace.\r\n\r\n3:9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?\r\n3:10 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men\r\nto be exercised in it.\r\n\r\n3:11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set\r\nthe world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that\r\nGod maketh from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\n3:12 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice,\r\nand to do good in his life.\r\n\r\n3:13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good\r\nof all his labour, it is the gift of God.\r\n\r\n3:14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing\r\ncan be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that\r\nmen should fear before him.\r\n\r\n3:15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already\r\nbeen; and God requireth that which is past.\r\n\r\n3:16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that\r\nwickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n3:17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the\r\nwicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n3:18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,\r\nthat God might manifest them, and that they might see that they\r\nthemselves are beasts.\r\n\r\n3:19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even\r\none thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,\r\nthey have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a\r\nbeast: for all is vanity.\r\n\r\n3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit\r\nof the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  3:22 Wherefore I\r\nperceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice\r\nin his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to\r\nsee what shall be after him?  4:1 So I returned, and considered all\r\nthe oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of\r\nsuch as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of\r\ntheir oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.\r\n\r\n4:2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the\r\nliving which are yet alive.\r\n\r\n4:3 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who\r\nhath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.\r\n\r\n4:4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for\r\nthis a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n4:5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.\r\n\r\n4:6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with\r\ntravail and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n4:7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.\r\n\r\n4:8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath\r\nneither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour;\r\nneither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom\r\ndo I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it\r\nis a sore travail.\r\n\r\n4:9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n4:10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him\r\nthat is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.\r\n\r\n4:11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one\r\nbe warm alone?  4:12 And if one prevail against him, two shall\r\nwithstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\r\n\r\n4:13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king,\r\nwho will no more be admonished.\r\n\r\n4:14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is\r\nborn in his kingdom becometh poor.\r\n\r\n4:15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the\r\nsecond child that shall stand up in his stead.\r\n\r\n4:16 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been\r\nbefore them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.\r\nSurely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n5:1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more\r\nready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider\r\nnot that they do evil.\r\n\r\n5:2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to\r\nutter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth:\r\ntherefore let thy words be few.\r\n\r\n5:3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice is known by multitude of words.\r\n\r\n5:4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath\r\nno pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.\r\n\r\n5:5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest\r\nvow and not pay.\r\n\r\n5:6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou\r\nbefore the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry\r\nat thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?  5:7 For in the\r\nmultitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but\r\nfear thou God.\r\n\r\n5:8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting\r\nof judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for\r\nhe that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than\r\nthey.\r\n\r\n5:9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is\r\nserved by the field.\r\n\r\n5:10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he\r\nthat loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.\r\n\r\n5:11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what\r\ngood is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with\r\ntheir eyes?  5:12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he\r\neat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\n5:13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,\r\nriches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.\r\n\r\n5:14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,\r\nand there is nothing in his hand.\r\n\r\n5:15 As he came forth of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb, naked shall he return to\r\ngo as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may\r\ncarry away in his hand.\r\n\r\n5:16 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so\r\nshall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?\r\n5:17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow\r\nand wrath with his sickness.\r\n\r\n5:18 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to\r\neat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he\r\ntaketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him:\r\nfor it is his portion.\r\n\r\n5:19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath\r\ngiven him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to\r\nrejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.\r\n\r\n5:20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God\r\nanswereth him in the joy of his heart.\r\n\r\n6:1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common\r\namong men: 6:2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and\r\nhonour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he\r\ndesireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger\r\neateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.\r\n\r\n6:3 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that\r\nthe days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good,\r\nand also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is\r\nbetter than he.\r\n\r\n6:4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his\r\nname shall be covered with darkness.\r\n\r\n6:5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath\r\nmore rest than the other.\r\n\r\n6:6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen\r\nno good: do not all go to one place?  6:7 All the labour of man is for\r\nhis mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.\r\n\r\n6:8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,\r\nthat knoweth to walk before the living?  6:9 Better is the sight of\r\nthe eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n6:10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is\r\nman: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.\r\n\r\n6:11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the\r\nbetter?  6:12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all\r\nthe days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can\r\ntell a man what shall be after him under the sun?  7:1 A good name is\r\nbetter than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s birth.\r\n\r\n7:2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the\r\nhouse of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will\r\nlay it to his heart.\r\n\r\n7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the\r\ncountenance the heart is made better.\r\n\r\n7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart\r\nof fools is in the house of mirth.\r\n\r\n7:5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to\r\nhear the song of fools.\r\n\r\n7:6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of\r\nthe fool: this also is vanity.\r\n\r\n7:7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n7:8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the\r\npatient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.\r\n\r\n7:9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the\r\nbosom of fools.\r\n\r\n7:10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better\r\nthan these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.\r\n\r\n7:11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to\r\nthem that see the sun.\r\n\r\n7:12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the\r\nexcellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have\r\nit.\r\n\r\n7:13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which\r\nhe hath made crooked?  7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in\r\nthe day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against\r\nthe other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.\r\n\r\n7:15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just\r\nman that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man\r\nthat prolongeth his life in his wickedness.\r\n\r\n7:16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why\r\nshouldest thou destroy thyself ?  7:17 Be not over much wicked,\r\nneither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?  7:18\r\nIt is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this\r\nwithdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\n7:19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are\r\nin the city.\r\n\r\n7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and\r\nsinneth not.\r\n\r\n7:21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear\r\nthy servant curse thee: 7:22 For oftentimes also thine own heart\r\nknoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.\r\n\r\n7:23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it\r\nwas far from me.\r\n\r\n7:24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?\r\n7:25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out\r\nwisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly,\r\neven of foolishness and madness: 7:26 And I find more bitter than\r\ndeath the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as\r\nbands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall\r\nbe taken by her.\r\n\r\n7:27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by\r\none, to find out the account: 7:28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I\r\nfind not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all\r\nthose have I not found.\r\n\r\n7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but\r\nthey have sought out many inventions.\r\n\r\n8:1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a\r\nthing?  a man\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of\r\nhis face shall be changed.\r\n\r\n8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment, and that in regard\r\nof the oath of God.\r\n\r\n8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;\r\nfor he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.\r\n\r\n8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto\r\nhim, What doest thou?  8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no\r\nevil thing: and a wise man\xe2\x80\x99s heart discerneth both time and judgment.\r\n\r\n8:6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the\r\nmisery of man is great upon him.\r\n\r\n8:7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when\r\nit shall be?  8:8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to\r\nretain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and\r\nthere is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver\r\nthose that are given to it.\r\n\r\n8:9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is\r\ndone under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over\r\nanother to his own hurt.\r\n\r\n8:10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the\r\nplace of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had\r\nso done: this is also vanity.\r\n\r\n8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,\r\ntherefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n8:12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be\r\nprolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear\r\nGod, which fear before him: 8:13 But it shall not be well with the\r\nwicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow;\r\nbecause he feareth not before God.\r\n\r\n8:14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be\r\njust men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked;\r\nagain, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work\r\nof the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.\r\n\r\n8:15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under\r\nthe sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall\r\nabide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth\r\nhim under the sun.\r\n\r\n8:16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business\r\nthat is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor\r\nnight seeth sleep with his eyes:) 8:17 Then I beheld all the work of\r\nGod, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun:\r\nbecause though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it;\r\nyea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be\r\nable to find it.\r\n\r\n9:1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this,\r\nthat the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of\r\nGod: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.\r\n\r\n9:2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous,\r\nand to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;\r\nto him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the\r\ngood, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an\r\noath.\r\n\r\n9:3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that\r\nthere is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is\r\nfull of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after\r\nthat they go to the dead.\r\n\r\n9:4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a\r\nliving dog is better than a dead lion.\r\n\r\n9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any\r\nthing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now\r\nperished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing\r\nthat is done under the sun.\r\n\r\n9:7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a\r\nmerry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.\r\n\r\n9:8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no\r\nointment.\r\n\r\n9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the\r\nlife of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the\r\ndays of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy\r\nlabour which thou takest under the sun.\r\n\r\n9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for\r\nthere is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,\r\nwhither thou goest.\r\n\r\n9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the\r\nswift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,\r\nnor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of\r\nskill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\r\n\r\n9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken\r\nin an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are\r\nthe sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n9:13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great\r\nunto me: 9:14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and\r\nthere came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great\r\nbulwarks against it: 9:15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man,\r\nand he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that\r\nsame poor man.\r\n\r\n9:16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the\r\npoor man\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.\r\n\r\n9:17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him\r\nthat ruleth among fools.\r\n\r\n9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth\r\nmuch good.\r\n\r\n10:1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a\r\nstinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for\r\nwisdom and honour.\r\n\r\n10:2 A wise man\xe2\x80\x99s heart is at his right hand; but a fool\xe2\x80\x99s heart at\r\nhis left.\r\n\r\n10:3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom\r\nfaileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.\r\n\r\n10:4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy\r\nplace; for yielding pacifieth great offences.\r\n\r\n10:5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error\r\nwhich proceedeth from the ruler: 10:6 Folly is set in great dignity,\r\nand the rich sit in low place.\r\n\r\n10:7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\n10:8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an\r\nhedge, a serpent shall bite him.\r\n\r\n10:9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that\r\ncleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.\r\n\r\n10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he\r\nput to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.\r\n\r\n10:11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler\r\nis no better.\r\n\r\n10:12 The words of a wise man\xe2\x80\x99s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a\r\nfool will swallow up himself.\r\n\r\n10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the\r\nend of his talk is mischievous madness.\r\n\r\n10:14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;\r\nand what shall be after him, who can tell him?  10:15 The labour of\r\nthe foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to\r\ngo to the city.\r\n\r\n10:16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes\r\neat in the morning!  10:17 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is\r\nthe son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength,\r\nand not for drunkenness!  10:18 By much slothfulness the building\r\ndecayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money\r\nanswereth all things.\r\n\r\n10:20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the\r\nrich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice,\r\nand that which hath wings shall tell the matter.\r\n\r\n11:1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n11:2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not\r\nwhat evil shall be upon the earth.\r\n\r\n11:3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the\r\nearth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in\r\nthe place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.\r\n\r\n11:4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth\r\nthe clouds shall not reap.\r\n\r\n11:5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the\r\nbones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou\r\nknowest not the works of God who maketh all.\r\n\r\n11:6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not\r\nthine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or\r\nthat, or whether they both shall be alike good.\r\n\r\n11:7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes\r\nto behold the sun: 11:8 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in\r\nthem all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be\r\nmany. All that cometh is vanity.\r\n\r\n11:9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee\r\nin the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in\r\nthe sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God\r\nwill bring thee into judgment.\r\n\r\n11:10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from\r\nthy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.\r\n\r\n12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil\r\ndays come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no\r\npleasure in them; 12:2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or\r\nthe stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 12:3\r\nIn the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong\r\nmen shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few,\r\nand those that look out of the windows be darkened, 12:4 And the doors\r\nshall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low,\r\nand he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters\r\nof musick shall be brought low; 12:5 Also when they shall be afraid of\r\nthat which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree\r\nshall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire\r\nshall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go\r\nabout the streets: 12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the\r\ngolden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or\r\nthe wheel broken at the cistern.\r\n\r\n12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit\r\nshall return unto God who gave it.\r\n\r\n12:8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.\r\n\r\n12:9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the\r\npeople knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in\r\norder many proverbs.\r\n\r\n12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which\r\nwas written was upright, even words of truth.\r\n\r\n12:11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the\r\nmasters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.\r\n\r\n12:12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many\r\nbooks there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.\r\n\r\n12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and\r\nkeep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\r\n\r\n12:14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret\r\nthing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Song of Solomon\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The song of songs, which is Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is\r\nbetter than wine.\r\n\r\n1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as\r\nointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.\r\n\r\n1:4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his\r\nchambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy\r\nlove more than wine: the upright love thee.\r\n\r\n1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents\r\nof Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.\r\n\r\n1:6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked\r\nupon me: my mother\xe2\x80\x99s children were angry with me; they made me the\r\nkeeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.\r\n\r\n1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where\r\nthou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that\r\nturneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?  1:8 If thou know not,\r\nO thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the\r\nflock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds\xe2\x80\x99 tents.\r\n\r\n1:9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in\r\nPharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s chariots.\r\n\r\n1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\n1:11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.\r\n\r\n1:12 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth\r\nthe smell thereof.\r\n\r\n1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all\r\nnight betwixt my breasts.\r\n\r\n1:14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards\r\nof Engedi.\r\n\r\n1:15 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast\r\ndoves\xe2\x80\x99 eyes.\r\n\r\n1:16 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n1:17 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.\r\n\r\n2:1 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.\r\n\r\n2:2 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.\r\n\r\n2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved\r\namong the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and\r\nhis fruit was sweet to my taste.\r\n\r\n2:4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n2:5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n2:6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace\r\nme.\r\n\r\n2:7 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the\r\nhinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n2:8 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the\r\nmountains, skipping upon the hills.\r\n\r\n2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth\r\nbehind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself\r\nthrough the lattice.\r\n\r\n2:10 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair\r\none, and come away.\r\n\r\n2:11 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 2:12 The\r\nflowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,\r\nand the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 2:13 The fig tree\r\nputteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give\r\na good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.\r\n\r\n2:14 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret\r\nplaces of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy\r\nvoice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\r\n\r\n2:15 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for\r\nour vines have tender grapes.\r\n\r\n2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.\r\n\r\n2:17 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,\r\nand be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.\r\n\r\n3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,\r\nbut I found him not.\r\n\r\n3:2 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the\r\nbroad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I\r\nfound him not.\r\n\r\n3:3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw\r\nye him whom my soul loveth?  3:4 It was but a little that I passed\r\nfrom them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would\r\nnot let him go, until I had brought him into my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, and\r\ninto the chamber of her that conceived me.\r\n\r\n3:5 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the\r\nhinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n3:6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of\r\nsmoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the\r\nmerchant?  3:7 Behold his bed, which is Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s; threescore valiant\r\nmen are about it, of the valiant of Israel.\r\n\r\n3:8 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his\r\nsword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.\r\n\r\n3:9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n3:10 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of\r\ngold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with\r\nlove, for the daughters of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3:11 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with\r\nthe crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his\r\nespousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.\r\n\r\n4:1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast\r\ndoves\xe2\x80\x99 eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that\r\nappear from mount Gilead.\r\n\r\n4:2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which\r\ncame up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is\r\nbarren among them.\r\n\r\n4:3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely:\r\nthy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.\r\n\r\n4:4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,\r\nwhereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.\r\n\r\n4:5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed\r\namong the lilies.\r\n\r\n4:6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to\r\nthe mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.\r\n\r\n4:7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.\r\n\r\n4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look\r\nfrom the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the\r\nlions\xe2\x80\x99 dens, from the mountains of the leopards.\r\n\r\n4:9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast\r\nravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.\r\n\r\n4:10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is\r\nthy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!\r\n4:11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are\r\nunder thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of\r\nLebanon.\r\n\r\n4:12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a\r\nfountain sealed.\r\n\r\n4:13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;\r\ncamphire, with spikenard, 4:14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and\r\ncinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all\r\nthe chief spices: 4:15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters,\r\nand streams from Lebanon.\r\n\r\n4:16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,\r\nthat the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his\r\ngarden, and eat his pleasant fruits.\r\n\r\n5:1 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my\r\nmyrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have\r\ndrunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink\r\nabundantly, O beloved.\r\n\r\n5:2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that\r\nknocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my\r\nundefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\n5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my\r\nfeet; how shall I defile them?  5:4 My beloved put in his hand by the\r\nhole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.\r\n\r\n5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh,\r\nand my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\n5:6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and\r\nwas gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not\r\nfind him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.\r\n\r\n5:7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,\r\nthey wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.\r\n\r\n5:8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,\r\nthat ye tell him, that I am sick of love.\r\n\r\n5:9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest\r\namong women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou\r\ndost so charge us?  5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest\r\namong ten thousand.\r\n\r\n5:11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black\r\nas a raven.\r\n\r\n5:12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed\r\nwith milk, and fitly set.\r\n\r\n5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips\r\nlike lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.\r\n\r\n5:14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as\r\nbright ivory overlaid with sapphires.\r\n\r\n5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:\r\nhis countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.\r\n\r\n5:16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my\r\nbeloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n6:1 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither\r\nis thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.\r\n\r\n6:2 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to\r\nfeed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.\r\n\r\n6:3 I am my beloved\xe2\x80\x99s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the\r\nlilies.\r\n\r\n6:4 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,\r\nterrible as an army with banners.\r\n\r\n6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair\r\nis as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.\r\n\r\n6:6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing,\r\nwhereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n6:7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.\r\n\r\n6:8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins\r\nwithout number.\r\n\r\n6:9 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her\r\nmother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw\r\nher, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they\r\npraised her.\r\n\r\n6:10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon,\r\nclear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?  6:11 I went\r\ndown into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to\r\nsee whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.\r\n\r\n6:12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of\r\nAmminadib.\r\n\r\n6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look\r\nupon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company\r\nof two armies.\r\n\r\n7:1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince\xe2\x80\x99s daughter! the\r\njoints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a\r\ncunning workman.\r\n\r\n7:2 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy\r\nbelly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.\r\n\r\n7:3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.\r\n\r\n7:4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in\r\nHeshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of\r\nLebanon which looketh toward Damascus.\r\n\r\n7:5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head\r\nlike purple; the king is held in the galleries.\r\n\r\n7:6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!  7:7\r\nThis thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters\r\nof grapes.\r\n\r\n7:8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the\r\nboughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,\r\nand the smell of thy nose like apples; 7:9 And the roof of thy mouth\r\nlike the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing\r\nthe lips of those that are asleep to speak.\r\n\r\n7:10 I am my beloved\xe2\x80\x99s, and his desire is toward me.\r\n\r\n7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in\r\nthe villages.\r\n\r\n7:12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine\r\nflourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud\r\nforth: there will I give thee my loves.\r\n\r\n7:13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of\r\npleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my\r\nbeloved.\r\n\r\n8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my\r\nmother!  when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I\r\nshould not be despised.\r\n\r\n8:2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, who\r\nwould instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the\r\njuice of my pomegranate.\r\n\r\n8:3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should\r\nembrace me.\r\n\r\n8:4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor\r\nawake my love, until he please.\r\n\r\n8:5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her\r\nbeloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother\r\nbrought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.\r\n\r\n8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for\r\nlove is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals\r\nthereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.\r\n\r\n8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it:\r\nif a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would\r\nutterly be contemned.\r\n\r\n8:8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do\r\nfor our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?  8:9 If she be\r\na wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a\r\ndoor, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.\r\n\r\n8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes\r\nas one that found favour.\r\n\r\n8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto\r\nkeepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand\r\npieces of silver.\r\n\r\n8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must\r\nhave a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.\r\n\r\n8:13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy\r\nvoice: cause me to hear it.\r\n\r\n8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young\r\nhart upon the mountains of spices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of the Prophet Isaiah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning\r\nJudah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,\r\nkings of Judah.\r\n\r\n1:2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken,\r\nI have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master\xe2\x80\x99s crib: but\r\nIsrael doth not know, my people doth not consider.\r\n\r\n1:4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of\r\nevildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD,\r\nthey have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone\r\naway backward.\r\n\r\n1:5 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more:\r\nthe whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.\r\n\r\n1:6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness\r\nin it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not\r\nbeen closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.\r\n\r\n1:7 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your\r\nland, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as\r\noverthrown by strangers.\r\n\r\n1:8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a\r\nlodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.\r\n\r\n1:9 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we\r\nshould have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the\r\nlaw of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n1:11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?\r\nsaith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat\r\nof fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of\r\nlambs, or of he goats.\r\n\r\n1:12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your\r\nhand, to tread my courts?  1:13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense\r\nis an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of\r\nassemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are\r\na trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.\r\n\r\n1:15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from\r\nyou: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are\r\nfull of blood.\r\n\r\n1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from\r\nbefore mine eyes; cease to do evil; 1:17 Learn to do well; seek\r\njudgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\n1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your\r\nsins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red\r\nlike crimson, they shall be as wool.\r\n\r\n1:19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:\r\n1:20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:\r\nfor the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.\r\n\r\n1:21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of\r\njudgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.\r\n\r\n1:22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 1:23 Thy\r\nprinces are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth\r\ngifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless,\r\nneither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.\r\n\r\n1:24 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of\r\nIsrael, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine\r\nenemies: 1:25 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away\r\nthy dross, and take away all thy tin: 1:26 And I will restore thy\r\njudges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning:\r\nafterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the\r\nfaithful city.\r\n\r\n1:27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n1:28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall\r\nbe together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.\r\n\r\n1:29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and\r\nye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.\r\n\r\n1:30 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that\r\nhath no water.\r\n\r\n1:31 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark,\r\nand they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.\r\n\r\n2:1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n2:2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of\r\nthe LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and\r\nshall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.\r\n\r\n2:3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the\r\nmountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will\r\nteach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion\r\nshall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2:4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many\r\npeople: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their\r\nspears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against\r\nnation, neither shall they learn war any more.\r\n\r\n2:5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n2:6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,\r\nbecause they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like\r\nthe Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n2:7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any\r\nend of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is\r\nthere any end of their chariots: 2:8 Their land also is full of idols;\r\nthey worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers\r\nhave made: 2:9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man\r\nhumbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.\r\n\r\n2:10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the\r\nLORD, and for the glory of his majesty.\r\n\r\n2:11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of\r\nmen shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n2:12 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is\r\nproud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be\r\nbrought low: 2:13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high\r\nand lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 2:14 And upon all the\r\nhigh mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, 2:15 And\r\nupon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 2:16 And upon all\r\nthe ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.\r\n\r\n2:17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness\r\nof men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n2:18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.\r\n\r\n2:19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves\r\nof the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty,\r\nwhen he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\r\n\r\n2:20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols\r\nof gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles\r\nand to the bats; 2:21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the\r\ntops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of\r\nhis majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\r\n\r\n2:22 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein\r\nis he to be accounted of ?  3:1 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of\r\nhosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the\r\nstaff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.\r\n\r\n3:2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,\r\nand the prudent, and the ancient, 3:3 The captain of fifty, and the\r\nhonourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the\r\neloquent orator.\r\n\r\n3:4 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n3:5 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every\r\none by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against\r\nthe ancient, and the base against the honourable.\r\n\r\n3:6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his\r\nfather, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this\r\nruin be under thy hand: 3:7 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will\r\nnot be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make\r\nme not a ruler of the people.\r\n\r\n3:8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue\r\nand their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n3:9 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they\r\ndeclare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for\r\nthey have rewarded evil unto themselves.\r\n\r\n3:10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they\r\nshall eat the fruit of their doings.\r\n\r\n3:11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of\r\nhis hands shall be given him.\r\n\r\n3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule\r\nover them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and\r\ndestroy the way of thy paths.\r\n\r\n3:13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.\r\n\r\n3:14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his\r\npeople, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard;\r\nthe spoil of the poor is in your houses.\r\n\r\n3:15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the\r\nfaces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.\r\n\r\n3:16 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are\r\nhaughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking\r\nand mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 3:17\r\nTherefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the\r\ndaughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.\r\n\r\n3:18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling\r\nornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires\r\nlike the moon, 3:19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,\r\n3:20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,\r\nand the tablets, and the earrings, 3:21 The rings, and nose jewels,\r\n3:22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the\r\nwimples, and the crisping pins, 3:23 The glasses, and the fine linen,\r\nand the hoods, and the vails.\r\n\r\n3:24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there\r\nshall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well\r\nset hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;\r\nand burning instead of beauty.\r\n\r\n3:25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.\r\n\r\n3:26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate\r\nshall sit upon the ground.\r\n\r\n4:1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We\r\nwill eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be\r\ncalled by thy name, to take away our reproach.\r\n\r\n4:2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and\r\nglorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for\r\nthem that are escaped of Israel.\r\n\r\n4:3 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he\r\nthat remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that\r\nis written among the living in Jerusalem: 4:4 When the Lord shall have\r\nwashed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged\r\nthe blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of\r\njudgment, and by the spirit of burning.\r\n\r\n4:5 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion,\r\nand upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of\r\na flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.\r\n\r\n4:6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from\r\nthe heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and\r\nfrom rain.\r\n\r\n5:1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching\r\nhis vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:\r\n5:2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted\r\nit with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and\r\nalso made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring\r\nforth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.\r\n\r\n5:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I\r\npray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.\r\n\r\n5:4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not\r\ndone in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth\r\ngrapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  5:5 And now go to; I will tell\r\nyou what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof,\r\nand it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it\r\nshall be trodden down: 5:6 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be\r\npruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will\r\nalso command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.\r\n\r\n5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and\r\nthe men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but\r\nbehold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.\r\n\r\n5:8 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,\r\ntill there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of\r\nthe earth!  5:9 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many\r\nhouses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.\r\n\r\n5:10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of\r\nan homer shall yield an ephah.\r\n\r\n5:11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may\r\nfollow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame\r\nthem!  5:12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and\r\nwine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,\r\nneither consider the operation of his hands.\r\n\r\n5:13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no\r\nknowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude\r\ndried up with thirst.\r\n\r\n5:14 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth\r\nwithout measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp,\r\nand he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.\r\n\r\n5:15 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall\r\nbe humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: 5:16 But the\r\nLORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall\r\nbe sanctified in righteousness.\r\n\r\n5:17 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste\r\nplaces of the fat ones shall strangers eat.\r\n\r\n5:18 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as\r\nit were with a cart rope: 5:19 That say, Let him make speed, and\r\nhasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy\r\nOne of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!  5:20 Woe unto\r\nthem that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light,\r\nand light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for\r\nbitter!  5:21 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and\r\nprudent in their own sight!  5:22 Woe unto them that are mighty to\r\ndrink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: 5:23 Which\r\njustify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the\r\nrighteous from him!  5:24 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble,\r\nand the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as\r\nrottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have\r\ncast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the\r\nHoly One of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:25 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,\r\nand he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten\r\nthem: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the\r\nmidst of the streets.\r\n\r\nFor all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched\r\nout still.\r\n\r\n5:26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will\r\nhiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come\r\nwith speed swiftly: 5:27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them;\r\nnone shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins\r\nbe loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: 5:28 Whose arrows\r\nare sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs shall be\r\ncounted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 5:29 Their\r\nroaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea,\r\nthey shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away\r\nsafe, and none shall deliver it.\r\n\r\n5:30 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of\r\nthe sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow,\r\nand the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.\r\n\r\n6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon\r\na throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.\r\n\r\n6:2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain\r\nhe covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with\r\ntwain he did fly.\r\n\r\n6:3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the\r\nLORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.\r\n\r\n6:4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,\r\nand the house was filled with smoke.\r\n\r\n6:5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of\r\nunclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:\r\nfor mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n6:6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his\r\nhand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 6:7 And he\r\nlaid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and\r\nthine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\r\n\r\n6:8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and\r\nwho will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.\r\n\r\n6:9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but\r\nunderstand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.\r\n\r\n6:10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and\r\nshut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their\r\nears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.\r\n\r\n6:11 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be\r\nwasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be\r\nutterly desolate, 6:12 And the LORD have removed men far away, and\r\nthere be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.\r\n\r\n6:13 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be\r\neaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when\r\nthey cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n7:1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son\r\nof Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the\r\nson of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war\r\nagainst it, but could not prevail against it.\r\n\r\n7:2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate\r\nwith Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as\r\nthe trees of the wood are moved with the wind.\r\n\r\n7:3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou,\r\nand Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool\r\nin the highway of the fuller\xe2\x80\x99s field; 7:4 And say unto him, Take heed,\r\nand be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of\r\nthese smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,\r\nand of the son of Remaliah.\r\n\r\n7:5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil\r\ncounsel against thee, saying, 7:6 Let us go up against Judah, and vex\r\nit, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the\r\nmidst of it, even the son of Tabeal: 7:7 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It\r\nshall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.\r\n\r\n7:8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is\r\nRezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken,\r\nthat it be not a people.\r\n\r\n7:9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is\r\nRemaliah\xe2\x80\x99s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n7:10 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 7:11 Ask thee a\r\nsign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n7:12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing\r\nfor you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?  7:14 Therefore\r\nthe Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall\r\nconceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\r\n\r\n7:15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the\r\nevil, and choose the good.\r\n\r\n7:16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose\r\nthe good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her\r\nkings.\r\n\r\n7:17 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim\r\ndeparted from Judah; even the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n7:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss\r\nfor the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and\r\nfor the bee that is in the land of Assyria.\r\n\r\n7:19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate\r\nvalleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon\r\nall bushes.\r\n\r\n7:20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,\r\nnamely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head,\r\nand the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.\r\n\r\n7:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a\r\nyoung cow, and two sheep; 7:22 And it shall come to pass, for the\r\nabundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter\r\nand honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.\r\n\r\n7:23 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be,\r\nwhere there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall\r\neven be for briers and thorns.\r\n\r\n7:24 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the\r\nland shall become briers and thorns.\r\n\r\n7:25 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there\r\nshall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be\r\nfor the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.\r\n\r\n8:1 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write\r\nin it with a man\xe2\x80\x99s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.\r\n\r\n8:2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,\r\nand Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.\r\n\r\n8:3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.\r\n\r\nThen said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.\r\n\r\n8:4 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and\r\nmy mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be\r\ntaken away before the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n8:5 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 8:6 Forasmuch as this\r\npeople refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in\r\nRezin and Remaliah\xe2\x80\x99s son; 8:7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth\r\nup upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king\r\nof Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his\r\nchannels, and go over all his banks: 8:8 And he shall pass through\r\nJudah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck;\r\nand the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy\r\nland, O Immanuel.\r\n\r\n8:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in\r\npieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye\r\nshall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n8:10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the\r\nword, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.\r\n\r\n8:11 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed\r\nme that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, 8:12 Say\r\nye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A\r\nconfederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.\r\n\r\n8:13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and\r\nlet him be your dread.\r\n\r\n8:14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and\r\nfor a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for\r\na snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n8:15 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and\r\nbe snared, and be taken.\r\n\r\n8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.\r\n\r\n8:17 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the\r\nhouse of Jacob, and I will look for him.\r\n\r\n8:18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for\r\nsigns and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth\r\nin mount Zion.\r\n\r\n8:19 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have\r\nfamiliar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should\r\nnot a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?  8:20 To\r\nthe law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this\r\nword, it is because there is no light in them.\r\n\r\n8:21 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it\r\nshall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret\r\nthemselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.\r\n\r\n8:22 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and\r\ndarkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.\r\n\r\n9:1 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,\r\nwhen at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the\r\nland of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the\r\nway of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.\r\n\r\n9:2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they\r\nthat dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the\r\nlight shined.\r\n\r\n9:3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they\r\njoy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice\r\nwhen they divide the spoil.\r\n\r\n9:4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his\r\nshoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.\r\n\r\n9:5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and\r\ngarments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the\r\ngovernment shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called\r\nWonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The\r\nPrince of Peace.\r\n\r\n9:7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,\r\nupon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to\r\nestablish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for\r\never. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.\r\n\r\n9:8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.\r\n\r\n9:9 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of\r\nSamaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, 9:10 The bricks\r\nare fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are\r\ncut down, but we will change them into cedars.\r\n\r\n9:11 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against\r\nhim, and join his enemies together; 9:12 The Syrians before, and the\r\nPhilistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For\r\nall this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n9:13 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do\r\nthey seek the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n9:14 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch\r\nand rush, in one day.\r\n\r\n9:15 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that\r\nteacheth lies, he is the tail.\r\n\r\n9:16 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that\r\nare led of them are destroyed.\r\n\r\n9:17 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither\r\nshall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an\r\nhypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all\r\nthis his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n9:18 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers\r\nand thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they\r\nshall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.\r\n\r\n9:19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and\r\nthe people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n9:20 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he\r\nshall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they\r\nshall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 9:21 Manasseh, Ephraim;\r\nand Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For\r\nall this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n10:1 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write\r\ngrievousness which they have prescribed; 10:2 To turn aside the needy\r\nfrom judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people,\r\nthat widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!\r\n10:3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the\r\ndesolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?\r\nand where will ye leave your glory?  10:4 Without me they shall bow\r\ndown under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all\r\nthis his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n10:5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is\r\nmine indignation.\r\n\r\n10:6 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the\r\npeople of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to\r\ntake the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.\r\n\r\n10:7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but\r\nit is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.\r\n\r\n10:8 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?  10:9 Is not\r\nCalno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as\r\nDamascus?  10:10 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and\r\nwhose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 10:11\r\nShall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to\r\nJerusalem and her idols?  10:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that\r\nwhen the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on\r\nJerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of\r\nAssyria, and the glory of his high looks.\r\n\r\n10:13 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by\r\nmy wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the\r\npeople, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the\r\ninhabitants like a valiant man: 10:14 And my hand hath found as a nest\r\nthe riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left,\r\nhave I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing,\r\nor opened the mouth, or peeped.\r\n\r\n10:15 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or\r\nshall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the\r\nrod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the\r\nstaff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.\r\n\r\n10:16 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat\r\nones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the\r\nburning of a fire.\r\n\r\n10:17 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One\r\nfor a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in\r\none day; 10:18 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his\r\nfruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a\r\nstandard-bearer fainteth.\r\n\r\n10:19 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a\r\nchild may write them.\r\n\r\n10:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of\r\nIsrael, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more\r\nagain stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the\r\nHoly One of Israel, in truth.\r\n\r\n10:21 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the\r\nmighty God.\r\n\r\n10:22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a\r\nremnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow\r\nwith righteousness.\r\n\r\n10:23 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even\r\ndetermined, in the midst of all the land.\r\n\r\n10:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that\r\ndwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee\r\nwith a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\n10:25 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,\r\nand mine anger in their destruction.\r\n\r\n10:26 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according\r\nto the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was\r\nupon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.\r\n\r\n10:27 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be\r\ntaken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and\r\nthe yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.\r\n\r\n10:28 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath\r\nlaid up his carriages: 10:29 They are gone over the passage: they have\r\ntaken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n10:30 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard\r\nunto Laish, O poor Anathoth.\r\n\r\n10:31 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves\r\nto flee.\r\n\r\n10:32 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand\r\nagainst the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n10:33 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with\r\nterror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the\r\nhaughty shall be humbled.\r\n\r\n10:34 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and\r\nLebanon shall fall by a mighty one.\r\n\r\n11:1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a\r\nBranch shall grow out of his roots: 11:2 And the spirit of the LORD\r\nshall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the\r\nspirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear\r\nof the LORD; 11:3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the\r\nfear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,\r\nneither reprove after the hearing of his ears: 11:4 But with\r\nrighteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the\r\nmeek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his\r\nmouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.\r\n\r\n11:5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and\r\nfaithfulness the girdle of his reins.\r\n\r\n11:6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall\r\nlie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling\r\ntogether; and a little child shall lead them.\r\n\r\n11:7 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie\r\ndown together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\r\n\r\n11:8 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the\r\nweaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice\xe2\x80\x99 den.\r\n\r\n11:9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the\r\nearth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n11:10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall\r\nstand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and\r\nhis rest shall be glorious.\r\n\r\n11:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set\r\nhis hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people,\r\nwhich shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros,\r\nand from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and\r\nfrom the islands of the sea.\r\n\r\n11:12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall\r\nassemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of\r\nJudah from the four corners of the earth.\r\n\r\n11:13 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of\r\nJudah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall\r\nnot vex Ephraim.\r\n\r\n11:14 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward\r\nthe west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay\r\ntheir hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n11:15 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian\r\nsea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river,\r\nand shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.\r\n\r\n11:16 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,\r\nwhich shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day\r\nthat he came up out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n12:1 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:\r\nthough thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou\r\ncomfortedst me.\r\n\r\n12:2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for\r\nthe LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\n12:3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\n12:4 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his\r\nname, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name\r\nis exalted.\r\n\r\n12:5 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is\r\nknown in all the earth.\r\n\r\n12:6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy\r\nOne of Israel in the midst of thee.\r\n\r\n13:1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.\r\n\r\n13:2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto\r\nthem, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.\r\n\r\n13:3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty\r\nones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.\r\n\r\n13:4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great\r\npeople; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered\r\ntogether: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.\r\n\r\n13:5 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the\r\nLORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.\r\n\r\n13:6 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a\r\ndestruction from the Almighty.\r\n\r\n13:7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man\xe2\x80\x99s heart shall\r\nmelt: 13:8 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold\r\nof them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall\r\nbe amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.\r\n\r\n13:9 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and\r\nfierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the\r\nsinners thereof out of it.\r\n\r\n13:10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not\r\ngive their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and\r\nthe moon shall not cause her light to shine.\r\n\r\n13:11 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for\r\ntheir iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,\r\nand will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\r\n\r\n13:12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than\r\nthe golden wedge of Ophir.\r\n\r\n13:13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove\r\nout of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of\r\nhis fierce anger.\r\n\r\n13:14 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man\r\ntaketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every\r\none into his own land.\r\n\r\n13:15 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one\r\nthat is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.\r\n\r\n13:16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes;\r\ntheir houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.\r\n\r\n13:17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not\r\nregard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.\r\n\r\n13:18 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they\r\nshall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not\r\nspare children.\r\n\r\n13:19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexcellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n13:20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from\r\ngeneration to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there;\r\nneither shall the shepherds make their fold there.\r\n\r\n13:21 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses\r\nshall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and\r\nsatyrs shall dance there.\r\n\r\n13:22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate\r\nhouses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to\r\ncome, and her days shall not be prolonged.\r\n\r\n14:1 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose\r\nIsrael, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be\r\njoined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.\r\n\r\n14:2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:\r\nand the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for\r\nservants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose\r\ncaptives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.\r\n\r\n14:3 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give\r\nthee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard\r\nbondage wherein thou wast made to serve, 14:4 That thou shalt take up\r\nthis proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the\r\noppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  14:5 The LORD hath broken\r\nthe staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.\r\n\r\n14:6 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that\r\nruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.\r\n\r\n14:7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n14:8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,\r\nsaying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.\r\n\r\n14:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming:\r\nit stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the\r\nearth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n14:10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become\r\nweak as we? art thou become like unto us?  14:11 Thy pomp is brought\r\ndown to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread\r\nunder thee, and the worms cover thee.\r\n\r\n14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\r\nhow art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!\r\n14:13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I\r\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the\r\nmount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14:14 I will\r\nascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.\r\n\r\n14:15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.\r\n\r\n14:16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider\r\nthee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did\r\nshake kingdoms; 14:17 That made the world as a wilderness, and\r\ndestroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his\r\nprisoners?  14:18 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie\r\nin glory, every one in his own house.\r\n\r\n14:19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,\r\nand as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a\r\nsword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden\r\nunder feet.\r\n\r\n14:20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast\r\ndestroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall\r\nnever be renowned.\r\n\r\n14:21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their\r\nfathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the\r\nface of the world with cities.\r\n\r\n14:22 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and\r\ncut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n14:23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of\r\nwater: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the\r\nLORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n14:24 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought,\r\nso shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:\r\n14:25 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains\r\ntread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and\r\nhis burden depart from off their shoulders.\r\n\r\n14:26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and\r\nthis is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.\r\n\r\n14:27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?\r\nand his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?  14:28 In\r\nthe year that king Ahaz died was this burden.\r\n\r\n14:29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that\r\nsmote thee is broken: for out of the serpent\xe2\x80\x99s root shall come forth a\r\ncockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.\r\n\r\n14:30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall\r\nlie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall\r\nslay thy remnant.\r\n\r\n14:31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved:\r\nfor there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone\r\nin his appointed times.\r\n\r\n14:32 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That\r\nthe LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n15:1 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid\r\nwaste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is\r\nlaid waste, and brought to silence; 15:2 He is gone up to Bajith, and\r\nto Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and\r\nover Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\n15:3 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on\r\nthe tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl,\r\nweeping abundantly.\r\n\r\n15:4 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard\r\neven unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out;\r\nhis life shall be grievous unto him.\r\n\r\n15:5 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto\r\nZoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith\r\nwith weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they\r\nshall raise up a cry of destruction.\r\n\r\n15:6 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is\r\nwithered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.\r\n\r\n15:7 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they\r\nhave laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.\r\n\r\n15:8 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling\r\nthereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.\r\n\r\n15:9 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring\r\nmore upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the\r\nremnant of the land.\r\n\r\n16:1 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the\r\nwilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.\r\n\r\n16:2 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest,\r\nso the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.\r\n\r\n16:3 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in\r\nthe midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that\r\nwandereth.\r\n\r\n16:4 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them\r\nfrom the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the\r\nspoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.\r\n\r\n16:5 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit\r\nupon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking\r\njudgment, and hasting righteousness.\r\n\r\n16:6 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his\r\nhaughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be\r\nso.\r\n\r\n16:7 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the\r\nfoundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.\r\n\r\n16:8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the\r\nlords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof,\r\nthey are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness:\r\nher branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.\r\n\r\n16:9 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of\r\nSibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for\r\nthe shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.\r\n\r\n16:10 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field;\r\nand in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be\r\nshouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I\r\nhave made their vintage shouting to cease.\r\n\r\n16:11 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine\r\ninward parts for Kirharesh.\r\n\r\n16:12 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on\r\nthe high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he\r\nshall not prevail.\r\n\r\n16:13 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n16:14 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the\r\nyears of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with\r\nall that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and\r\nfeeble.\r\n\r\n17:1 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being\r\na city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.\r\n\r\n17:2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which\r\nshall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.\r\n\r\n17:3 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from\r\nDamascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the\r\nchildren of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n17:4 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob\r\nshall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.\r\n\r\n17:5 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and\r\nreapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth\r\nears in the valley of Rephaim.\r\n\r\n17:6 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an\r\nolive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough,\r\nfour or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD\r\nGod of Israel.\r\n\r\n17:7 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall\r\nhave respect to the Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n17:8 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,\r\nneither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the\r\ngroves, or the images.\r\n\r\n17:9 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and\r\nan uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of\r\nIsrael: and there shall be desolation.\r\n\r\n17:10 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast\r\nnot been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou\r\nplant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips: 17:11 In\r\nthe day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt\r\nthou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the\r\nday of grief and of desperate sorrow.\r\n\r\n17:12 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the\r\nnoise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing\r\nlike the rushing of mighty waters!  17:13 The nations shall rush like\r\nthe rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall\r\nflee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before\r\nthe wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.\r\n\r\n17:14 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThis is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that\r\nrob us.\r\n\r\n18:1 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers\r\nof Ethiopia: 18:2 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels\r\nof bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a\r\nnation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning\r\nhitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers\r\nhave spoiled!  18:3 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on\r\nthe earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and\r\nwhen he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.\r\n\r\n18:4 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will\r\nconsider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a\r\ncloud of dew in the heat of harvest.\r\n\r\n18:5 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour\r\ngrape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with\r\npruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.\r\n\r\n18:6 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and\r\nto the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and\r\nall the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.\r\n\r\n18:7 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts\r\nof a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from\r\ntheir beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot,\r\nwhose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the\r\nLORD of hosts, the mount Zion.\r\n\r\n19:1 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud,\r\nand shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at\r\nhis presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n19:2 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they\r\nshall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his\r\nneighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.\r\n\r\n19:3 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I\r\nwill destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols,\r\nand to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to\r\nthe wizards.\r\n\r\n19:4 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;\r\nand a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n19:5 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be\r\nwasted and dried up.\r\n\r\n19:6 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of\r\ndefence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall\r\nwither.\r\n\r\n19:7 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and\r\nevery thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n19:8 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into\r\nthe brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters\r\nshall languish.\r\n\r\n19:9 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave\r\nnetworks, shall be confounded.\r\n\r\n19:10 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make\r\nsluices and ponds for fish.\r\n\r\n19:11 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise\r\ncounsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I\r\nam the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?  19:12 Where are\r\nthey? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them\r\nknow what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.\r\n\r\n19:13 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are\r\ndeceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of\r\nthe tribes thereof.\r\n\r\n19:14 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:\r\nand they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken\r\nman staggereth in his vomit.\r\n\r\n19:15 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or\r\ntail, branch or rush, may do.\r\n\r\n19:16 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be\r\nafraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of\r\nhosts, which he shaketh over it.\r\n\r\n19:17 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one\r\nthat maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the\r\ncounsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.\r\n\r\n19:18 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the\r\nlanguage of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be\r\ncalled, The city of destruction.\r\n\r\n19:19 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of\r\nthe land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.\r\n\r\n19:20 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of\r\nhosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because\r\nof the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one,\r\nand he shall deliver them.\r\n\r\n19:21 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall\r\nknow the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea,\r\nthey shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.\r\n\r\n19:22 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and\r\nthey shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them,\r\nand shall heal them.\r\n\r\n19:23 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,\r\nand the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria,\r\nand the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.\r\n\r\n19:24 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with\r\nAssyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land: 19:25 Whom the LORD\r\nof hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria\r\nthe work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.\r\n\r\n20:1 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king\r\nof Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it; 20:2 At\r\nthe same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and\r\nloose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy\r\nfoot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.\r\n\r\n20:3 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked\r\nand barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon\r\nEthiopia; 20:4 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians\r\nprisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and\r\nbarefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.\r\n\r\n20:5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their\r\nexpectation, and of Egypt their glory.\r\n\r\n20:6 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,\r\nsuch is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from\r\nthe king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?  21:1 The burden of the\r\ndesert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it\r\ncometh from the desert, from a terrible land.\r\n\r\n21:2 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer\r\ndealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam:\r\nbesiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.\r\n\r\n21:3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold\r\nupon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at\r\nthe hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.\r\n\r\n21:4 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my\r\npleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.\r\n\r\n21:5 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye\r\nprinces, and anoint the shield.\r\n\r\n21:6 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him\r\ndeclare what he seeth.\r\n\r\n21:7 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of\r\nasses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much\r\nheed: 21:8 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the\r\nwatchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 21:9\r\nAnd, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.\r\n\r\nAnd he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the\r\ngraven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.\r\n\r\n21:10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have\r\nheard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n21:11 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,\r\nwhat of the night? Watchman, what of the night?  21:12 The watchman\r\nsaid, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire,\r\nenquire ye: return, come.\r\n\r\n21:13 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge,\r\nO ye travelling companies of Dedanim.\r\n\r\n21:14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that\r\nwas thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.\r\n\r\n21:15 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from\r\nthe bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.\r\n\r\n21:16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to\r\nthe years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: 21:17\r\nAnd the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the\r\nchildren of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel\r\nhath spoken it.\r\n\r\n22:1 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that\r\nthou art wholly gone up to the housetops?  22:2 Thou that art full of\r\nstirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city: thy slain men are not slain\r\nwith the sword, nor dead in battle.\r\n\r\n22:3 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers:\r\nall that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n22:4 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour\r\nnot to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n22:5 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of\r\nperplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking\r\ndown the walls, and of crying to the mountains.\r\n\r\n22:6 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and\r\nKir uncovered the shield.\r\n\r\n22:7 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be\r\nfull of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\n22:8 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in\r\nthat day to the armour of the house of the forest.\r\n\r\n22:9 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they\r\nare many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.\r\n\r\n22:10 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses\r\nhave ye broken down to fortify the wall.\r\n\r\n22:11 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the\r\nold pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had\r\nrespect unto him that fashioned it long ago.\r\n\r\n22:12 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and\r\nto mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 22:13 And\r\nbehold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating\r\nflesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n22:14 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely\r\nthis iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord\r\nGOD of hosts.\r\n\r\n22:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this\r\ntreasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say, 22:16\r\nWhat hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed\r\nthee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on\r\nhigh, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?  22:17\r\nBehold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and\r\nwill surely cover thee.\r\n\r\n22:18 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a\r\nlarge country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy\r\nglory shall be the shame of thy lord\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n22:19 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall\r\nhe pull thee down.\r\n\r\n22:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my\r\nservant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 22:21 And I will clothe him with\r\nthy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy\r\ngovernment into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants\r\nof Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.\r\n\r\n22:22 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder;\r\nso he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none\r\nshall open.\r\n\r\n22:23 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be\r\nfor a glorious throne to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n22:24 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity,\r\nfrom the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.\r\n\r\n22:25 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is\r\nfastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and\r\nthe burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken\r\nit.\r\n\r\n23:1 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid\r\nwaste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of\r\nChittim it is revealed to them.\r\n\r\n23:2 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of\r\nZidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.\r\n\r\n23:3 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river,\r\nis her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.\r\n\r\n23:4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the\r\nstrength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children,\r\nneither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.\r\n\r\n23:5 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained\r\nat the report of Tyre.\r\n\r\n23:6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.\r\n\r\n23:7 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her\r\nown feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.\r\n\r\n23:8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,\r\nwhose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of\r\nthe earth?  23:9 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the\r\npride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n23:10 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there\r\nis no more strength.\r\n\r\n23:11 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:\r\nthe LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to\r\ndestroy the strong holds thereof.\r\n\r\n23:12 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed\r\nvirgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also\r\nshalt thou have no rest.\r\n\r\n23:13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the\r\nAssyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up\r\nthe towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought\r\nit to ruin.\r\n\r\n23:14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.\r\n\r\n23:15 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be\r\nforgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the\r\nend of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.\r\n\r\n23:16 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been\r\nforgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n23:17 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that\r\nthe LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall\r\ncommit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n23:18 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD:\r\nit shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be\r\nfor them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for\r\ndurable clothing.\r\n\r\n24:1 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and\r\nturneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with\r\nthe servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her\r\nmistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender,\r\nso with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of\r\nusury to him.\r\n\r\n24:3 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the\r\nLORD hath spoken this word.\r\n\r\n24:4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and\r\nfadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.\r\n\r\n24:5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because\r\nthey have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the\r\neverlasting covenant.\r\n\r\n24:6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell\r\ntherein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are\r\nburned, and few men left.\r\n\r\n24:7 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted\r\ndo sigh.\r\n\r\n24:8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice\r\nendeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.\r\n\r\n24:9 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be\r\nbitter to them that drink it.\r\n\r\n24:10 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,\r\nthat no man may come in.\r\n\r\n24:11 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened,\r\nthe mirth of the land is gone.\r\n\r\n24:12 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n24:13 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people,\r\nthere shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning\r\ngrapes when the vintage is done.\r\n\r\n24:14 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty\r\nof the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.\r\n\r\n24:15 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the\r\nLORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.\r\n\r\n24:16 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even\r\nglory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto\r\nme! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the\r\ntreacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.\r\n\r\n24:17 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n24:18 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of\r\nthe fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the\r\nmidst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on\r\nhigh are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.\r\n\r\n24:19 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved,\r\nthe earth is moved exceedingly.\r\n\r\n24:20 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be\r\nremoved like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy\r\nupon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.\r\n\r\n24:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall\r\npunish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of\r\nthe earth upon the earth.\r\n\r\n24:22 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered\r\nin the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days\r\nshall they be visited.\r\n\r\n24:23 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the\r\nLORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before\r\nhis ancients gloriously.\r\n\r\n25:1 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy\r\nname; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are\r\nfaithfulness and truth.\r\n\r\n25:2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin:\r\na palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.\r\n\r\n25:3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the\r\nterrible nations shall fear thee.\r\n\r\n25:4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the\r\nneedy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the\r\nheat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n25:5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a\r\ndry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the\r\nterrible ones shall be brought low.\r\n\r\n25:6 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people\r\na feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things\r\nfull of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.\r\n\r\n25:7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering\r\ncast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.\r\n\r\n25:8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe\r\naway tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he\r\ntake away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.\r\n\r\n25:9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have\r\nwaited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited\r\nfor him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.\r\n\r\n25:10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab\r\nshall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the\r\ndunghill.\r\n\r\n25:11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he\r\nthat swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring\r\ndown their pride together with the spoils of their hands.\r\n\r\n25:12 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring\r\ndown, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.\r\n\r\n26:1 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have\r\na strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.\r\n\r\n26:2 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the\r\ntruth may enter in.\r\n\r\n26:3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on\r\nthee: because he trusteth in thee.\r\n\r\n26:4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is\r\neverlasting strength: 26:5 For he bringeth down them that dwell on\r\nhigh; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the\r\nground; he bringeth it even to the dust.\r\n\r\n26:6 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the\r\nsteps of the needy.\r\n\r\n26:7 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost\r\nweigh the path of the just.\r\n\r\n26:8 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for\r\nthee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n26:9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my\r\nspirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in\r\nthe earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.\r\n\r\n26:10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn\r\nrighteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and\r\nwill not behold the majesty of the LORD.\r\n\r\n26:11 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they\r\nshall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire\r\nof thine enemies shall devour them.\r\n\r\n26:12 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought\r\nall our works in us.\r\n\r\n26:13 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over\r\nus: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.\r\n\r\n26:14 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they\r\nshall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and\r\nmade all their memory to perish.\r\n\r\n26:15 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the\r\nnation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the\r\nends of the earth.\r\n\r\n26:16 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a\r\nprayer when thy chastening was upon them.\r\n\r\n26:17 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her\r\ndelivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in\r\nthy sight, O LORD.\r\n\r\n26:18 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it\r\nwere brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the\r\nearth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.\r\n\r\n26:19 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they\r\narise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the\r\ndew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.\r\n\r\n26:20 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy\r\ndoors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until\r\nthe indignation be overpast.\r\n\r\n26:21 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the\r\ninhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall\r\ndisclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.\r\n\r\n27:1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword\r\nshall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that\r\ncrooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\r\n\r\n27:2 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.\r\n\r\n27:3 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any\r\nhurt it, I will keep it night and day.\r\n\r\n27:4 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me\r\nin battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.\r\n\r\n27:5 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with\r\nme; and he shall make peace with me.\r\n\r\n27:6 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall\r\nblossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.\r\n\r\n27:7 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he\r\nslain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?  27:8\r\nIn measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he\r\nstayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.\r\n\r\n27:9 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this\r\nis all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones\r\nof the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and\r\nimages shall not stand up.\r\n\r\n27:10 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation\r\nforsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and\r\nthere shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.\r\n\r\n27:11 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off:\r\nthe women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no\r\nunderstanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on\r\nthem, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.\r\n\r\n27:12 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat\r\noff from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye\r\nshall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.\r\n\r\n27:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet\r\nshall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the\r\nland of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall\r\nworship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n28:1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose\r\nglorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat\r\nvalleys of them that are overcome with wine!  28:2 Behold, the Lord\r\nhath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a\r\ndestroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast\r\ndown to the earth with the hand.\r\n\r\n28:3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden\r\nunder feet: 28:4 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the\r\nfat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before\r\nthe summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet\r\nin his hand he eateth it up.\r\n\r\n28:5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and\r\nfor a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, 28:6 And for a\r\nspirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength\r\nto them that turn the battle to the gate.\r\n\r\n28:7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink\r\nare out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through\r\nstrong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way\r\nthrough strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.\r\n\r\n28:8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is\r\nno place clean.\r\n\r\n28:9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to\r\nunderstand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn\r\nfrom the breasts.\r\n\r\n28:10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line\r\nupon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little: 28:11\r\nFor with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n28:12 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the\r\nweary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.\r\n\r\n28:13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,\r\nprecept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little,\r\nand there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be\r\nbroken, and snared, and taken.\r\n\r\n28:14 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule\r\nthis people which is in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n28:15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and\r\nwith hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass\r\nthrough, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge,\r\nand under falsehood have we hid ourselves: 28:16 Therefore thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried\r\nstone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth\r\nshall not make haste.\r\n\r\n28:17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the\r\nplummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the\r\nwaters shall overflow the hiding place.\r\n\r\n28:18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your\r\nagreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge\r\nshall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.\r\n\r\n28:19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning\r\nby morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a\r\nvexation only to understand the report.\r\n\r\n28:20 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on\r\nit: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.\r\n\r\n28:21 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be\r\nwroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange\r\nwork; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.\r\n\r\n28:22 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong:\r\nfor I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even\r\ndetermined upon the whole earth.\r\n\r\n28:23 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.\r\n\r\n28:24 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the\r\nclods of his ground?  28:25 When he hath made plain the face thereof,\r\ndoth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast\r\nin the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their\r\nplace?  28:26 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth\r\nteach him.\r\n\r\n28:27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,\r\nneither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches\r\nare beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.\r\n\r\n28:28 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it,\r\nnor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\n28:29 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is\r\nwonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.\r\n\r\n29:1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year\r\nto year; let them kill sacrifices.\r\n\r\n29:2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and\r\nsorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.\r\n\r\n29:3 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege\r\nagainst thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.\r\n\r\n29:4 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the\r\nground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice\r\nshall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground,\r\nand thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.\r\n\r\n29:5 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,\r\nand the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth\r\naway: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.\r\n\r\n29:6 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with\r\nearthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of\r\ndevouring fire.\r\n\r\n29:7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,\r\neven all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress\r\nher, shall be as a dream of a night vision.\r\n\r\n29:8 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he\r\neateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty\r\nman dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold,\r\nhe is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all\r\nthe nations be, that fight against mount Zion.\r\n\r\n29:9 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are\r\ndrunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.\r\n\r\n29:10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,\r\nand hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers\r\nhath he covered.\r\n\r\n29:11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book\r\nthat is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read\r\nthis, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: 29:12 And\r\nthe book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I\r\npray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.\r\n\r\n29:13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me\r\nwith their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed\r\ntheir heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the\r\nprecept of men: 29:14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a\r\nmarvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a\r\nwonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the\r\nunderstanding of their prudent men shall be hid.\r\n\r\n29:15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the\r\nLORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and\r\nwho knoweth us?  29:16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall\r\nbe esteemed as the potter\xe2\x80\x99s clay: for shall the work say of him that\r\nmade it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that\r\nframed it, He had no understanding?  29:17 Is it not yet a very little\r\nwhile, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the\r\nfruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?  29:18 And in that day\r\nshall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind\r\nshall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.\r\n\r\n29:19 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor\r\namong men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n29:20 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is\r\nconsumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: 29:21 That make\r\na man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth\r\nin the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.\r\n\r\n29:22 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning\r\nthe house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his\r\nface now wax pale.\r\n\r\n29:23 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the\r\nmidst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One\r\nof Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.\r\n\r\n29:24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and\r\nthey that murmured shall learn doctrine.\r\n\r\n30:1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take\r\ncounsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my\r\nspirit, that they may add sin to sin: 30:2 That walk to go down into\r\nEgypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the\r\nstrength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!  30:3\r\nTherefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust\r\nin the shadow of Egypt your confusion.\r\n\r\n30:4 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.\r\n\r\n30:5 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor\r\nbe an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.\r\n\r\n30:6 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble\r\nand anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and\r\nfiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders\r\nof young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a\r\npeople that shall not profit them.\r\n\r\n30:7 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:\r\ntherefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n30:8 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book,\r\nthat it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 30:9 That this\r\nis a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear\r\nthe law of the LORD: 30:10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the\r\nprophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth\r\nthings, prophesy deceits: 30:11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out\r\nof the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.\r\n\r\n30:12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise\r\nthis word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:\r\n30:13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to\r\nfall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at\r\nan instant.\r\n\r\n30:14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters\xe2\x80\x99 vessel\r\nthat is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not\r\nbe found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth,\r\nor to take water withal out of the pit.\r\n\r\n30:15 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In\r\nreturning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence\r\nshall be your strength: and ye would not.\r\n\r\n30:16 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall\r\nye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that\r\npursue you be swift.\r\n\r\n30:17 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of\r\nfive shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a\r\nmountain, and as an ensign on an hill.\r\n\r\n30:18 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto\r\nyou, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon\r\nyou: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n30:19 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep\r\nno more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry;\r\nwhen he shall hear it, he will answer thee.\r\n\r\n30:20 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the\r\nwater of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a\r\ncorner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: 30:21 And\r\nthine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way,\r\nwalk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n30:22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of\r\nsilver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast\r\nthem away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee\r\nhence.\r\n\r\n30:23 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the\r\nground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be\r\nfat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large\r\npastures.\r\n\r\n30:24 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall\r\neat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with\r\nthe fan.\r\n\r\n30:25 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high\r\nhill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter,\r\nwhen the towers fall.\r\n\r\n30:26 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,\r\nand the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven\r\ndays, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people,\r\nand healeth the stroke of their wound.\r\n\r\n30:27 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his\r\nanger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of\r\nindignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 30:28 And his breath,\r\nas an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to\r\nsift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle\r\nin the jaws of the people, causing them to err.\r\n\r\n30:29 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is\r\nkept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come\r\ninto the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.\r\n\r\n30:30 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and\r\nshall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his\r\nanger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and\r\ntempest, and hailstones.\r\n\r\n30:31 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten\r\ndown, which smote with a rod.\r\n\r\n30:32 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which\r\nthe LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and\r\nin battles of shaking will he fight with it.\r\n\r\n30:33 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared;\r\nhe hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much\r\nwood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle\r\nit.\r\n\r\n31:1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses,\r\nand trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because\r\nthey are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel,\r\nneither seek the LORD!  31:2 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil,\r\nand will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of\r\nthe evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.\r\n\r\n31:3 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,\r\nand not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that\r\nhelpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they\r\nall shall fail together.\r\n\r\n31:4 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the\r\nyoung lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is\r\ncalled forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor\r\nabase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come\r\ndown to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.\r\n\r\n31:5 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;\r\ndefending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve\r\nit.\r\n\r\n31:6 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply\r\nrevolted.\r\n\r\n31:7 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,\r\nand his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a\r\nsin.\r\n\r\n31:8 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man;\r\nand the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee\r\nfrom the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.\r\n\r\n31:9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his\r\nprinces shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is\r\nin Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n32:1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall\r\nrule in judgment.\r\n\r\n32:2 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert\r\nfrom the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of\r\na great rock in a weary land.\r\n\r\n32:3 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of\r\nthem that hear shall hearken.\r\n\r\n32:4 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the\r\ntongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.\r\n\r\n32:5 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl\r\nsaid to be bountiful.\r\n\r\n32:6 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work\r\niniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD,\r\nto make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of\r\nthe thirsty to fail.\r\n\r\n32:7 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked\r\ndevices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy\r\nspeaketh right.\r\n\r\n32:8 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things\r\nshall he stand.\r\n\r\n32:9 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless\r\ndaughters; give ear unto my speech.\r\n\r\n32:10 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for\r\nthe vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.\r\n\r\n32:11 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless\r\nones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your\r\nloins.\r\n\r\n32:12 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for\r\nthe fruitful vine.\r\n\r\n32:13 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea,\r\nupon all the houses of joy in the joyous city: 32:14 Because the\r\npalaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left;\r\nthe forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses,\r\na pasture of flocks; 32:15 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on\r\nhigh, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field\r\nbe counted for a forest.\r\n\r\n32:16 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness\r\nremain in the fruitful field.\r\n\r\n32:17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of\r\nrighteousness quietness and assurance for ever.\r\n\r\n32:18 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure\r\ndwellings, and in quiet resting places; 32:19 When it shall hail,\r\ncoming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.\r\n\r\n32:20 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth\r\nthither the feet of the ox and the ass.\r\n\r\n33:1 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest\r\ntreacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou\r\nshalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make\r\nan end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.\r\n\r\n33:2 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou\r\ntheir arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.\r\n\r\n33:3 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of\r\nthyself the nations were scattered.\r\n\r\n33:4 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the\r\ncaterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n33:5 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion\r\nwith judgment and righteousness.\r\n\r\n33:6 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and\r\nstrength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.\r\n\r\n33:7 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of\r\npeace shall weep bitterly.\r\n\r\n33:8 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken\r\nthe covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.\r\n\r\n33:9 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn\r\ndown: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off\r\ntheir fruits.\r\n\r\n33:10 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will\r\nI lift up myself.\r\n\r\n33:11 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your\r\nbreath, as fire, shall devour you.\r\n\r\n33:12 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut\r\nup shall they be burned in the fire.\r\n\r\n33:13 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are\r\nnear, acknowledge my might.\r\n\r\n33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the\r\nhypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who\r\namong us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?  33:15 He that walketh\r\nrighteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of\r\noppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that\r\nstoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from\r\nseeing evil; 33:16 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall\r\nbe the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall\r\nbe sure.\r\n\r\n33:17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold\r\nthe land that is very far off.\r\n\r\n33:18 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is\r\nthe receiver? where is he that counted the towers?  33:19 Thou shalt\r\nnot see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst\r\nperceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.\r\n\r\n33:20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall\r\nsee Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken\r\ndown; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither\r\nshall any of the cords thereof be broken.\r\n\r\n33:21 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad\r\nrivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither\r\nshall gallant ship pass thereby.\r\n\r\n33:22 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is\r\nour king; he will save us.\r\n\r\n33:23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their\r\nmast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great\r\nspoil divided; the lame take the prey.\r\n\r\n33:24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that\r\ndwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.\r\n\r\n34:1 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the\r\nearth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that\r\ncome forth of it.\r\n\r\n34:2 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury\r\nupon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath\r\ndelivered them to the slaughter.\r\n\r\n34:3 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up\r\nout of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n34:4 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens\r\nshall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall\r\ndown, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from\r\nthe fig tree.\r\n\r\n34:5 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come\r\ndown upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.\r\n\r\n34:6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with\r\nfatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the\r\nkidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great\r\nslaughter in the land of Idumea.\r\n\r\n34:7 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with\r\nthe bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust\r\nmade fat with fatness.\r\n\r\n34:8 For it is the day of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance, and the year of\r\nrecompences for the controversy of Zion.\r\n\r\n34:9 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust\r\nthereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning\r\npitch.\r\n\r\n34:10 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall\r\ngo up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none\r\nshall pass through it for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n34:11 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also\r\nand the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the\r\nline of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.\r\n\r\n34:12 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none\r\nshall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.\r\n\r\n34:13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in\r\nthe fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and\r\na court for owls.\r\n\r\n34:14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild\r\nbeasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the\r\nscreech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n34:15 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and\r\ngather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered,\r\nevery one with her mate.\r\n\r\n34:16 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these\r\nshall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded,\r\nand his spirit it hath gathered them.\r\n\r\n34:17 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it\r\nunto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to\r\ngeneration shall they dwell therein.\r\n\r\n35:1 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and\r\nthe desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\r\n\r\n35:2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and\r\nsinging: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency\r\nof Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the\r\nexcellency of our God.\r\n\r\n35:3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.\r\n\r\n35:4 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:\r\nbehold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence;\r\nhe will come and save you.\r\n\r\n35:5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the\r\ndeaf shall be unstopped.\r\n\r\n35:6 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the\r\ndumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams\r\nin the desert.\r\n\r\n35:7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land\r\nsprings of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall\r\nbe grass with reeds and rushes.\r\n\r\n35:8 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called\r\nThe way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall\r\nbe for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.\r\n\r\n35:9 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up\r\nthereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk\r\nthere: 35:10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to\r\nZion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall\r\nobtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\r\n\r\n36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that\r\nSennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of\r\nJudah, and took them.\r\n\r\n36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem\r\nunto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of\r\nthe upper pool in the highway of the fuller\xe2\x80\x99s field.\r\n\r\n36:3 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah\xe2\x80\x99s son, which was over\r\nthe house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph\xe2\x80\x99s son, the recorder.\r\n\r\n36:4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith\r\nthe great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein\r\nthou trustest?  36:5 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words)\r\nI have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that\r\nthou rebellest against me?  36:6 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of\r\nthis broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his\r\nhand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n36:7 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not\r\nhe, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and\r\nsaid to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?\r\n36:8 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of\r\nAssyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on\r\nthy part to set riders upon them.\r\n\r\n36:9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least\r\nof my master\xe2\x80\x99s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and\r\nfor horsemen?  36:10 And am I now come up without the LORD against\r\nthis land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this\r\nland, and destroy it.\r\n\r\n36:11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I\r\npray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand\r\nit: and speak not to us in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 language, in the ears of the\r\npeople that are on the wall.\r\n\r\n36:12 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to\r\nthee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit\r\nupon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own\r\npiss with you?  36:13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud\r\nvoice in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great\r\nking, the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n36:14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall\r\nnot be able to deliver you.\r\n\r\n36:15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The\r\nLORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the\r\nhand of the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n36:16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,\r\nMake an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye\r\nevery one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye\r\nevery one the waters of his own cistern; 36:17 Until I come and take\r\nyou away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land\r\nof bread and vineyards.\r\n\r\n36:18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver\r\nus.\r\n\r\nHath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand\r\nof the king of Assyria?  36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and\r\nArphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered\r\nSamaria out of my hand?  36:20 Who are they among all the gods of\r\nthese lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the\r\nLORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?  36:21 But they held\r\ntheir peace, and answered him not a word: for the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment\r\nwas, saying, Answer him not.\r\n\r\n36:22 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the\r\nhousehold, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the\r\nrecorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words\r\nof Rabshakeh.\r\n\r\n37:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent\r\nhis clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the\r\nhouse of the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the\r\nscribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto\r\nIsaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.\r\n\r\n37:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of\r\ntrouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to\r\nthe birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.\r\n\r\n37:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom\r\nthe king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God,\r\nand will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard:\r\nwherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.\r\n\r\n37:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.\r\n\r\n37:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,\r\nThus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard,\r\nwherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.\r\n\r\n37:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,\r\nand return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword\r\nin his own land.\r\n\r\n37:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring\r\nagainst Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.\r\n\r\n37:9 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come\r\nforth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers\r\nto Hezekiah, saying, 37:10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of\r\nJudah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee,\r\nsaying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of\r\nAssyria.\r\n\r\n37:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to\r\nall lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?\r\n37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers\r\nhave destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of\r\nEden which were in Telassar?  37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and\r\nthe king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and\r\nIvah?  37:14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the\r\nmessengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the\r\nLORD, and spread it before the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 37:16 O LORD of\r\nhosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art\r\nthe God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast\r\nmade heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n37:17 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,\r\nand see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to\r\nreproach the living God.\r\n\r\n37:18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the\r\nnations, and their countries, 37:19 And have cast their gods into the\r\nfire: for they were no gods, but the work of men\xe2\x80\x99s hands, wood and\r\nstone: therefore they have destroyed them.\r\n\r\n37:20 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all\r\nthe kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n37:21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against\r\nSennacherib king of Assyria: 37:22 This is the word which the LORD\r\nhath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath\r\ndespised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem\r\nhath shaken her head at thee.\r\n\r\n37:23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast\r\nthou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against\r\nthe Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n37:24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By\r\nthe multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the\r\nmountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall\r\ncedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter\r\ninto the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.\r\n\r\n37:25 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet\r\nhave I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.\r\n\r\n37:26 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient\r\ntimes, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou\r\nshouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.\r\n\r\n37:27 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were\r\ndismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as\r\nthe green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted\r\nbefore it be grown up.\r\n\r\n37:28 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and\r\nthy rage against me.\r\n\r\n37:29 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into\r\nmine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in\r\nthy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.\r\n\r\n37:30 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such\r\nas groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the\r\nsame: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and\r\neat the fruit thereof.\r\n\r\n37:31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall\r\nagain take root downward, and bear fruit upward: 37:32 For out of\r\nJerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount\r\nZion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.\r\n\r\n37:33 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He\r\nshall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come\r\nbefore it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.\r\n\r\n37:34 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall\r\nnot come into this city, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and\r\nfor my servant David\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of\r\nthe Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they\r\narose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.\r\n\r\n37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,\r\nand dwelt at Nineveh.\r\n\r\n37:38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of\r\nNisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with\r\nthe sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon\r\nhis son reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n38:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the\r\nprophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith\r\nthe LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.\r\n\r\n38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto\r\nthe LORD, 38:3 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I\r\nhave walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have\r\ndone that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.\r\n\r\n38:4 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 38:5 Go, and\r\nsay to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I\r\nhave heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto\r\nthy days fifteen years.\r\n\r\n38:6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king\r\nof Assyria: and I will defend this city.\r\n\r\n38:7 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD\r\nwill do this thing that he hath spoken; 38:8 Behold, I will bring\r\nagain the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of\r\nAhaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which\r\ndegrees it was gone down.\r\n\r\n38:9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and\r\nwas recovered of his sickness: 38:10 I said in the cutting off of my\r\ndays, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the\r\nresidue of my years.\r\n\r\n38:11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of\r\nthe living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n38:12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with\r\npining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.\r\n\r\n38:13 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all\r\nmy bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.\r\n\r\n38:14 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a\r\ndove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed;\r\nundertake for me.\r\n\r\n38:15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath\r\ndone it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.\r\n\r\n38:16 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the\r\nlife of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.\r\n\r\n38:17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love\r\nto my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast\r\nall my sins behind thy back.\r\n\r\n38:18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee:\r\nthey that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.\r\n\r\n38:19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:\r\nthe father to the children shall make known thy truth.\r\n\r\n38:20 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs\r\nto the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n38:21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it\r\nfor a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.\r\n\r\n38:22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to\r\nthe house of the LORD?  39:1 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of\r\nBaladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for\r\nhe had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.\r\n\r\n39:2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his\r\nprecious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the\r\nprecious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was\r\nfound in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his\r\ndominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.\r\n\r\n39:3 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto\r\nhim, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And\r\nHezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\n39:4 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah\r\nanswered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing\r\namong my treasures that I have not shewed them.\r\n\r\n39:5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:\r\n39:6 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that\r\nwhich thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be\r\ncarried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n39:7 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt\r\nbeget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace\r\nof the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n39:8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which\r\nthou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth\r\nin my days.\r\n\r\n40:1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.\r\n\r\n40:2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her\r\nwarfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath\r\nreceived of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s hand double for all her sins.\r\n\r\n40:3 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the\r\nway of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\r\n\r\n40:4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall\r\nbe made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough\r\nplaces plain: 40:5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and\r\nall flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken\r\nit.\r\n\r\n40:6 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is\r\ngrass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:\r\n40:7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the\r\nLORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.\r\n\r\n40:8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God\r\nshall stand for ever.\r\n\r\n40:9 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high\r\nmountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice\r\nwith strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of\r\nJudah, Behold your God!  40:10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with\r\nstrong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is\r\nwith him, and his work before him.\r\n\r\n40:11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the\r\nlambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead\r\nthose that are with young.\r\n\r\n40:12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and\r\nmeted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth\r\nin a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a\r\nbalance?  40:13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his\r\ncounsellor hath taught him?  40:14 With whom took he counsel, and who\r\ninstructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him\r\nknowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?  40:15 Behold,\r\nthe nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small\r\ndust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n40:16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof\r\nsufficient for a burnt offering.\r\n\r\n40:17 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to\r\nhim less than nothing, and vanity.\r\n\r\n40:18 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare\r\nunto him?  40:19 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith\r\nspreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.\r\n\r\n40:20 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a\r\ntree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to\r\nprepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.\r\n\r\n40:21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you\r\nfrom the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the\r\nearth?  40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and\r\nthe inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the\r\nheavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:\r\n40:23 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of\r\nthe earth as vanity.\r\n\r\n40:24 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:\r\nyea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also\r\nblow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take\r\nthem away as stubble.\r\n\r\n40:25 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the\r\nHoly One.\r\n\r\n40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these\r\nthings, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by\r\nnames by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power;\r\nnot one faileth.\r\n\r\n40:27 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid\r\nfrom the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?  40:28 Hast\r\nthou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the\r\nLORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is\r\nweary? there is no searching of his understanding.\r\n\r\n40:29 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he\r\nincreaseth strength.\r\n\r\n40:30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men\r\nshall utterly fall: 40:31 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew\r\ntheir strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall\r\nrun, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.\r\n\r\n41:1 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their\r\nstrength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near\r\ntogether to judgment.\r\n\r\n41:2 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his\r\nfoot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he\r\ngave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.\r\n\r\n41:3 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had\r\nnot gone with his feet.\r\n\r\n41:4 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the\r\nbeginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.\r\n\r\n41:5 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid,\r\ndrew near, and came.\r\n\r\n41:6 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his\r\nbrother, Be of good courage.\r\n\r\n41:7 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth\r\nwith the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the\r\nsodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.\r\n\r\n41:8 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the\r\nseed of Abraham my friend.\r\n\r\n41:9 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called\r\nthee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my\r\nservant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.\r\n\r\n41:10 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy\r\nGod: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold\r\nthee with the right hand of my righteousness.\r\n\r\n41:11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be\r\nashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive\r\nwith thee shall perish.\r\n\r\n41:12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that\r\ncontended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing,\r\nand as a thing of nought.\r\n\r\n41:13 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto\r\nthee, Fear not; I will help thee.\r\n\r\n41:14 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help\r\nthee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n41:15 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having\r\nteeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt\r\nmake the hills as chaff.\r\n\r\n41:16 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the\r\nwhirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and\r\nshalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n41:17 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their\r\ntongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of\r\nIsrael will not forsake them.\r\n\r\n41:18 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of\r\nthe valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry\r\nland springs of water.\r\n\r\n41:19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and\r\nthe myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree,\r\nand the pine, and the box tree together: 41:20 That they may see, and\r\nknow, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD\r\nhath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.\r\n\r\n41:21 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong\r\nreasons, saith the King of Jacob.\r\n\r\n41:22 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let\r\nthem shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them,\r\nand know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.\r\n\r\n41:23 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know\r\nthat ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed,\r\nand behold it together.\r\n\r\n41:24 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an\r\nabomination is he that chooseth you.\r\n\r\n41:25 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the\r\nrising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon\r\nprinces as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.\r\n\r\n41:26 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and\r\nbeforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that\r\nsheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that\r\nheareth your words.\r\n\r\n41:27 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will\r\ngive to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.\r\n\r\n41:28 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there\r\nwas no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.\r\n\r\n41:29 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their\r\nmolten images are wind and confusion.\r\n\r\n42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul\r\ndelighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth\r\njudgment to the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n42:2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n42:3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he\r\nnot quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.\r\n\r\n42:4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment\r\nin the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.\r\n\r\n42:5 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and\r\nstretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which\r\ncometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and\r\nspirit to them that walk therein: 42:6 I the LORD have called thee in\r\nrighteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give\r\nthee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; 42:7\r\nTo open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison,\r\nand them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.\r\n\r\n42:8 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to\r\nanother, neither my praise to graven images.\r\n\r\n42:9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I\r\ndeclare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.\r\n\r\n42:10 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of\r\nthe earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the\r\nisles, and the inhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n42:11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,\r\nthe villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock\r\nsing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.\r\n\r\n42:12 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n42:13 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up\r\njealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail\r\nagainst his enemies.\r\n\r\n42:14 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and\r\nrefrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will\r\ndestroy and devour at once.\r\n\r\n42:15 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their\r\nherbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the\r\npools.\r\n\r\n42:16 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will\r\nlead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness\r\nlight before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do\r\nunto them, and not forsake them.\r\n\r\n42:17 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that\r\ntrust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n42:18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.\r\n\r\n42:19 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I\r\nsent?  who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservant?  42:20 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening\r\nthe ears, but he heareth not.\r\n\r\n42:21 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness\xe2\x80\x99 sake; he will\r\nmagnify the law, and make it honourable.\r\n\r\n42:22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them\r\nsnared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a\r\nprey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.\r\n\r\n42:23 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear\r\nfor the time to come?  42:24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to\r\nthe robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for\r\nthey would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n42:25 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the\r\nstrength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he\r\nknew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.\r\n\r\n43:1 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he\r\nthat formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have\r\ncalled thee by thy name; thou art mine.\r\n\r\n43:2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and\r\nthrough the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest\r\nthrough the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame\r\nkindle upon thee.\r\n\r\n43:3 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I\r\ngave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.\r\n\r\n43:4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,\r\nand I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people\r\nfor thy life.\r\n\r\n43:5 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the\r\neast, and gather thee from the west; 43:6 I will say to the north,\r\nGive up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and\r\nmy daughters from the ends of the earth; 43:7 Even every one that is\r\ncalled by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed\r\nhim; yea, I have made him.\r\n\r\n43:8 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that\r\nhave ears.\r\n\r\n43:9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be\r\nassembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things?\r\nlet them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or\r\nlet them hear, and say, It is truth.\r\n\r\n43:10 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have\r\nchosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he:\r\nbefore me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.\r\n\r\n43:11 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.\r\n\r\n43:12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there\r\nwas no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the\r\nLORD, that I am God.\r\n\r\n43:13 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can\r\ndeliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?  43:14 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I\r\nhave sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the\r\nChaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.\r\n\r\n43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.\r\n\r\n43:16 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path\r\nin the mighty waters; 43:17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and\r\nhorse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they\r\nshall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.\r\n\r\n43:18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things\r\nof old.\r\n\r\n43:19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall\r\nye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers\r\nin the desert.\r\n\r\n43:20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the\r\nowls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the\r\ndesert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.\r\n\r\n43:21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n43:22 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been\r\nweary of me, O Israel.\r\n\r\n43:23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt\r\nofferings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have\r\nnot caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with\r\nincense.\r\n\r\n43:24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou\r\nfilled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to\r\nserve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.\r\n\r\n43:25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine\r\nown sake, and will not remember thy sins.\r\n\r\n43:26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that\r\nthou mayest be justified.\r\n\r\n43:27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n43:28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have\r\ngiven Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.\r\n\r\n44:1 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:\r\n44:2 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the\r\nwomb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou,\r\nJesurun, whom I have chosen.\r\n\r\n44:3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon\r\nthe dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing\r\nupon thine offspring: 44:4 And they shall spring up as among the\r\ngrass, as willows by the water courses.\r\n\r\n44:5 One shall say, I am the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s; and another shall call himself by\r\nthe name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the\r\nLORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.\r\n\r\n44:6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD\r\nof hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n44:7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in\r\norder for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things\r\nthat are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.\r\n\r\n44:8 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that\r\ntime, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God\r\nbeside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.\r\n\r\n44:9 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their\r\ndelectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses;\r\nthey see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.\r\n\r\n44:10 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is\r\nprofitable for nothing?  44:11 Behold, all his fellows shall be\r\nashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered\r\ntogether, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be\r\nashamed together.\r\n\r\n44:12 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and\r\nfashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his\r\narms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no\r\nwater, and is faint.\r\n\r\n44:13 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a\r\nline; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the\r\ncompass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the\r\nbeauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.\r\n\r\n44:14 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,\r\nwhich he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he\r\nplanteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.\r\n\r\n44:15 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,\r\nand warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he\r\nmaketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and\r\nfalleth down thereto.\r\n\r\n44:16 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth\r\nflesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself,\r\nand saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 44:17 And the residue\r\nthereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto\r\nit, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me;\r\nfor thou art my god.\r\n\r\n44:18 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes,\r\nthat they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.\r\n\r\n44:19 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge\r\nnor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea,\r\nalso I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh,\r\nand eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?\r\nshall I fall down to the stock of a tree?  44:20 He feedeth on ashes:\r\na deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his\r\nsoul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?  44:21 Remember\r\nthese, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed\r\nthee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n44:22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,\r\nas a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.\r\n\r\n44:23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower\r\nparts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest,\r\nand every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and\r\nglorified himself in Israel.\r\n\r\n44:24 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from\r\nthe womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth\r\nthe heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; 44:25\r\nThat frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad;\r\nthat turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;\r\n44:26 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the\r\ncounsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be\r\ninhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will\r\nraise up the decayed places thereof: 44:27 That saith to the deep, Be\r\ndry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 44:28 That saith of Cyrus, He is my\r\nshepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem,\r\nThou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.\r\n\r\n45:1 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I\r\nhave holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins\r\nof kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall\r\nnot be shut; 45:2 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places\r\nstraight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder\r\nthe bars of iron: 45:3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness,\r\nand hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the\r\nLORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.\r\n\r\n45:4 For Jacob my servant\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even\r\ncalled thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not\r\nknown me.\r\n\r\n45:5 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me:\r\nI girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 45:6 That they may know\r\nfrom the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none\r\nbeside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.\r\n\r\n45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create\r\nevil: I the LORD do all these things.\r\n\r\n45:8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down\r\nrighteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation,\r\nand let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.\r\n\r\n45:9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd\r\nstrive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that\r\nfashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?  45:10\r\nWoe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to\r\nthe woman, What hast thou brought forth?  45:11 Thus saith the LORD,\r\nthe Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come\r\nconcerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.\r\n\r\n45:12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my\r\nhands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\n45:13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his\r\nways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for\r\nprice nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n45:14 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of\r\nEthiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto\r\nthee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains\r\nthey shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall\r\nmake supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there\r\nis none else, there is no God.\r\n\r\n45:15 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the\r\nSaviour.\r\n\r\n45:16 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they\r\nshall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.\r\n\r\n45:17 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting\r\nsalvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.\r\n\r\n45:18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself\r\nthat formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created\r\nit not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there\r\nis none else.\r\n\r\n45:19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I\r\nsaid not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak\r\nrighteousness, I declare things that are right.\r\n\r\n45:20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are\r\nescaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of\r\ntheir graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.\r\n\r\n45:21 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel\r\ntogether: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it\r\nfrom that time?  have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside\r\nme; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.\r\n\r\n45:22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I\r\nam God, and there is none else.\r\n\r\n45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in\r\nrighteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall\r\nbow, every tongue shall swear.\r\n\r\n45:24 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and\r\nstrength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed\r\nagainst him shall be ashamed.\r\n\r\n45:25 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n46:1 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts,\r\nand upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a\r\nburden to the weary beast.\r\n\r\n46:2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the\r\nburden, but themselves are gone into captivity.\r\n\r\n46:3 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the\r\nhouse of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are\r\ncarried from the womb: 46:4 And even to your old age I am he; and even\r\nto hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I\r\nwill carry, and will deliver you.\r\n\r\n46:5 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that\r\nwe may be like?  46:6 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh\r\nsilver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god:\r\nthey fall down, yea, they worship.\r\n\r\n46:7 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in\r\nhis place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea,\r\none shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n46:8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O\r\nye transgressors.\r\n\r\n46:9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is\r\nnone else; I am God, and there is none like me, 46:10 Declaring the\r\nend from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not\r\nyet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my\r\npleasure: 46:11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that\r\nexecuteth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will\r\nalso bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.\r\n\r\n46:12 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from\r\nrighteousness: 46:13 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be\r\nfar off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation\r\nin Zion for Israel my glory.\r\n\r\n47:1 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit\r\non the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for\r\nthou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.\r\n\r\n47:2 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare\r\nthe leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.\r\n\r\n47:3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I\r\nwill take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.\r\n\r\n47:4 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n47:5 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the\r\nChaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.\r\n\r\n47:6 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and\r\ngiven them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the\r\nancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.\r\n\r\n47:7 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst\r\nnot lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter\r\nend of it.\r\n\r\n47:8 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that\r\ndwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else\r\nbeside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss\r\nof children: 47:9 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment\r\nin one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon\r\nthee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for\r\nthe great abundance of thine enchantments.\r\n\r\n47:10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None\r\nseeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and\r\nthou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.\r\n\r\n47:11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from\r\nwhence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be\r\nable to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly,\r\nwhich thou shalt not know.\r\n\r\n47:12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy\r\nsorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou\r\nshalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.\r\n\r\n47:13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the\r\nastrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up,\r\nand save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.\r\n\r\n47:14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they\r\nshall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall\r\nnot be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.\r\n\r\n47:15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even\r\nthy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his\r\nquarter; none shall save thee.\r\n\r\n48:1 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of\r\nIsrael, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by\r\nthe name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not\r\nin truth, nor in righteousness.\r\n\r\n48:2 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves\r\nupon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.\r\n\r\n48:3 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they\r\nwent forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly,\r\nand they came to pass.\r\n\r\n48:4 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron\r\nsinew, and thy brow brass; 48:5 I have even from the beginning\r\ndeclared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest\r\nthou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and\r\nmy molten image, hath commanded them.\r\n\r\n48:6 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have\r\nshewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou\r\ndidst not know them.\r\n\r\n48:7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the\r\nday when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I\r\nknew them.\r\n\r\n48:8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that\r\ntime that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal\r\nvery treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.\r\n\r\n48:9 For my name\xe2\x80\x99s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise\r\nwill I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.\r\n\r\n48:10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen\r\nthee in the furnace of affliction.\r\n\r\n48:11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how\r\nshould my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.\r\n\r\n48:12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am\r\nthe first, I also am the last.\r\n\r\n48:13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my\r\nright hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand\r\nup together.\r\n\r\n48:14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath\r\ndeclared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his\r\npleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\n48:15 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought\r\nhim, and he shall make his way prosperous.\r\n\r\n48:16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret\r\nfrom the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the\r\nLord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.\r\n\r\n48:17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am\r\nthe LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by\r\nthe way that thou shouldest go.\r\n\r\n48:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy\r\npeace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:\r\n48:19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy\r\nbowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off\r\nnor destroyed from before me.\r\n\r\n48:20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice\r\nof singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the\r\nearth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.\r\n\r\n48:21 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he\r\ncaused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock\r\nalso, and the waters gushed out.\r\n\r\n48:22 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.\r\n\r\n49:1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The\r\nLORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath\r\nhe made mention of my name.\r\n\r\n49:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of\r\nhis hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver\r\nhath he hid me; 49:3 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel,\r\nin whom I will be glorified.\r\n\r\n49:4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength\r\nfor nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and\r\nmy work with my God.\r\n\r\n49:5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his\r\nservant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered,\r\nyet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be\r\nmy strength.\r\n\r\n49:6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my\r\nservant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved\r\nof Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that\r\nthou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.\r\n\r\n49:7 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to\r\nhim whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant\r\nof rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship,\r\nbecause of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and\r\nhe shall choose thee.\r\n\r\n49:8 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and\r\nin a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee,\r\nand give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to\r\ncause to inherit the desolate heritages; 49:9 That thou mayest say to\r\nthe prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew\r\nyourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be\r\nin all high places.\r\n\r\n49:10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun\r\nsmite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by\r\nthe springs of water shall he guide them.\r\n\r\n49:11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be\r\nexalted.\r\n\r\n49:12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north\r\nand from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.\r\n\r\n49:13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into\r\nsinging, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will\r\nhave mercy upon his afflicted.\r\n\r\n49:14 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath\r\nforgotten me.\r\n\r\n49:15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have\r\ncompassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I\r\nnot forget thee.\r\n\r\n49:16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls\r\nare continually before me.\r\n\r\n49:17 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made\r\nthee waste shall go forth of thee.\r\n\r\n49:18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather\r\nthemselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou\r\nshalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind\r\nthem on thee, as a bride doeth.\r\n\r\n49:19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy\r\ndestruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the\r\ninhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.\r\n\r\n49:20 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the\r\nother, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me:\r\ngive place to me that I may dwell.\r\n\r\n49:21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these,\r\nseeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and\r\nremoving to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left\r\nalone; these, where had they been?  49:22 Thus saith the Lord GOD,\r\nBehold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my\r\nstandard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms,\r\nand thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.\r\n\r\n49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy\r\nnursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward\r\nthe earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that\r\nI am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.\r\n\r\n49:24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive\r\ndelivered?  49:25 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the\r\nmighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be\r\ndelivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and\r\nI will save thy children.\r\n\r\n49:26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and\r\nthey shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and\r\nall flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,\r\nthe mighty One of Jacob.\r\n\r\n50:1 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndivorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to\r\nwhom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold\r\nyourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.\r\n\r\n50:2 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was\r\nthere none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot\r\nredeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up\r\nthe sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because\r\nthere is no water, and dieth for thirst.\r\n\r\n50:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\n50:4 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I\r\nshould know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he\r\nwakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\n50:5 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,\r\nneither turned away back.\r\n\r\n50:6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked\r\noff the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.\r\n\r\n50:7 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be\r\nconfounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that\r\nI shall not be ashamed.\r\n\r\n50:8 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us\r\nstand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.\r\n\r\n50:9 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn\r\nme?  lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them\r\nup.\r\n\r\n50:10 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice\r\nof his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him\r\ntrust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.\r\n\r\n50:11 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about\r\nwith sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye\r\nhave kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\n51:1 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek\r\nthe LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of\r\nthe pit whence ye are digged.\r\n\r\n51:2 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for\r\nI called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.\r\n\r\n51:3 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste\r\nplaces; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like\r\nthe garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein,\r\nthanksgiving, and the voice of melody.\r\n\r\n51:4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:\r\nfor a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest\r\nfor a light of the people.\r\n\r\n51:5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine\r\narms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine\r\narm shall they trust.\r\n\r\n51:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth\r\nbeneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth\r\nshall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in\r\nlike manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness\r\nshall not be abolished.\r\n\r\n51:7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose\r\nheart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid\r\nof their revilings.\r\n\r\n51:8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall\r\neat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my\r\nsalvation from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n51:9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in\r\nthe ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath\r\ncut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?  51:10 Art thou not it which hath\r\ndried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths\r\nof the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?  51:11 Therefore the\r\nredeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion;\r\nand everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain\r\ngladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.\r\n\r\n51:12 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou\r\nshouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man\r\nwhich shall be made as grass; 51:13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker,\r\nthat hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the\r\nearth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of\r\nthe oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury\r\nof the oppressor?  51:14 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be\r\nloosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread\r\nshould fail.\r\n\r\n51:15 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves\r\nroared: The LORD of hosts is his name.\r\n\r\n51:16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in\r\nthe shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the\r\nfoundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.\r\n\r\n51:17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the\r\nhand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of\r\nthe cup of trembling, and wrung them out.\r\n\r\n51:18 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath\r\nbrought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all\r\nthe sons that she hath brought up.\r\n\r\n51:19 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for\r\nthee?  desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by\r\nwhom shall I comfort thee?  51:20 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at\r\nthe head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of\r\nthe fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.\r\n\r\n51:21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not\r\nwith wine: 51:22 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that\r\npleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine\r\nhand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou\r\nshalt no more drink it again: 51:23 But I will put it into the hand of\r\nthem that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we\r\nmay go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the\r\nstreet, to them that went over.\r\n\r\n52:1 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful\r\ngarments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no\r\nmore come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.\r\n\r\n52:2 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:\r\nloose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.\r\n\r\n52:3 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and\r\nye shall be redeemed without money.\r\n\r\n52:4 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into\r\nEgypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.\r\n\r\n52:5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people\r\nis taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl,\r\nsaith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.\r\n\r\n52:6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know\r\nin that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.\r\n\r\n52:7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that\r\nbringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good\r\ntidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy\r\nGod reigneth!  52:8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the\r\nvoice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when\r\nthe LORD shall bring again Zion.\r\n\r\n52:9 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of\r\nJerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n52:10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the\r\nnations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n52:11 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean\r\nthing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the\r\nvessels of the LORD.\r\n\r\n52:12 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the\r\nLORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.\r\n\r\n52:13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and\r\nextolled, and be very high.\r\n\r\n52:14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more\r\nthan any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 52:15 So shall\r\nhe sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him:\r\nfor that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which\r\nthey had not heard shall they consider.\r\n\r\n53:1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD\r\nrevealed?  53:2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and\r\nas a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and\r\nwhen we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\r\n\r\n53:3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and\r\nacquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he\r\nwas despised, and we esteemed him not.\r\n\r\n53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we\r\ndid esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\r\n\r\n53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our\r\niniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his\r\nstripes we are healed.\r\n\r\n53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to\r\nhis own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.\r\n\r\n53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his\r\nmouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before\r\nher shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\r\n\r\n53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare\r\nhis generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for\r\nthe transgression of my people was he stricken.\r\n\r\n53:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his\r\ndeath; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:\r\nwhen thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his\r\nseed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall\r\nprosper in his hand.\r\n\r\n53:11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:\r\nby his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall\r\nbear their iniquities.\r\n\r\n53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he\r\nshall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his\r\nsoul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he\r\nbare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\r\n\r\n54:1 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into\r\nsinging, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for\r\nmore are the children of the desolate than the children of the married\r\nwife, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n54:2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the\r\ncurtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and\r\nstrengthen thy stakes; 54:3 For thou shalt break forth on the right\r\nhand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and\r\nmake the desolate cities to be inhabited.\r\n\r\n54:4 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou\r\nconfounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget\r\nthe shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy\r\nwidowhood any more.\r\n\r\n54:5 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;\r\nand thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth\r\nshall he be called.\r\n\r\n54:6 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in\r\nspirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.\r\n\r\n54:7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies\r\nwill I gather thee.\r\n\r\n54:8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with\r\neverlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy\r\nRedeemer.\r\n\r\n54:9 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn\r\nthat the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I\r\nsworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.\r\n\r\n54:10 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my\r\nkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my\r\npeace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.\r\n\r\n54:11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,\r\nbehold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy\r\nfoundations with sapphires.\r\n\r\n54:12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of\r\ncarbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\r\n\r\n54:13 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great\r\nshall be the peace of thy children.\r\n\r\n54:14 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far\r\nfrom oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it\r\nshall not come near thee.\r\n\r\n54:15 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:\r\nwhosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.\r\n\r\n54:16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the\r\nfire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have\r\ncreated the waster to destroy.\r\n\r\n54:17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every\r\ntongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.\r\nThis is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their\r\nrighteousness is of me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n55:1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that\r\nhath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk\r\nwithout money and without price.\r\n\r\n55:2 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your\r\nlabour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and\r\neat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in\r\nfatness.\r\n\r\n55:3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall\r\nlive; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure\r\nmercies of David.\r\n\r\n55:4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader\r\nand commander to the people.\r\n\r\n55:5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and\r\nnations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy\r\nGod, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.\r\n\r\n55:6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he\r\nis near: 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man\r\nhis thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy\r\nupon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.\r\n\r\n55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my\r\nways, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways\r\nhigher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.\r\n\r\n55:10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and\r\nreturneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring\r\nforth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the\r\neater: 55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it\r\nshall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I\r\nplease, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\r\n\r\n55:12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the\r\nmountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and\r\nall the trees of the field shall clap their hands.\r\n\r\n55:13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of\r\nthe brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD\r\nfor a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.\r\n\r\n56:1 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my\r\nsalvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.\r\n\r\n56:2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that\r\nlayeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and\r\nkeepeth his hand from doing any evil.\r\n\r\n56:3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to\r\nthe LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his\r\npeople: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.\r\n\r\n56:4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,\r\nand choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;\r\n56:5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a\r\nplace and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give\r\nthem an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.\r\n\r\n56:6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD,\r\nto serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants,\r\nevery one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold\r\nof my covenant; 56:7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and\r\nmake them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and\r\ntheir sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house\r\nshall be called an house of prayer for all people.\r\n\r\n56:8 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet\r\nwill I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.\r\n\r\n56:9 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n56:10 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb\r\ndogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.\r\n\r\n56:11 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they\r\nare shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way,\r\nevery one for his gain, from his quarter.\r\n\r\n56:12 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves\r\nwith strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n57:1 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and\r\nmerciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is\r\ntaken away from the evil to come.\r\n\r\n57:2 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each\r\none walking in his uprightness.\r\n\r\n57:3 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the\r\nadulterer and the whore.\r\n\r\n57:4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide\r\nmouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression,\r\na seed of falsehood.\r\n\r\n57:5 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying\r\nthe children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?  57:6 Among\r\nthe smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy\r\nlot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered\r\na meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?  57:7 Upon a lofty\r\nand high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up\r\nto offer sacrifice.\r\n\r\n57:8 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy\r\nremembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and\r\nart gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with\r\nthem; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.\r\n\r\n57:9 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase\r\nthy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase\r\nthyself even unto hell.\r\n\r\n57:10 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou\r\nnot, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand;\r\ntherefore thou wast not grieved.\r\n\r\n57:11 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast\r\nlied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I\r\nheld my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?  57:12 I will\r\ndeclare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n57:13 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind\r\nshall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth\r\nhis trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy\r\nmountain; 57:14 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the\r\nway, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.\r\n\r\n57:15 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,\r\nwhose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also\r\nthat is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the\r\nhumble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\r\n\r\n57:16 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth:\r\nfor the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.\r\n\r\n57:17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him:\r\nI hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n57:18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,\r\nand restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.\r\n\r\n57:19 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far\r\noff, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.\r\n\r\n57:20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,\r\nwhose waters cast up mire and dirt.\r\n\r\n57:21 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\r\n\r\n58:1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew\r\nmy people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\r\n\r\n58:2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation\r\nthat did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God:\r\nthey ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in\r\napproaching to God.\r\n\r\n58:3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore\r\nhave we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in\r\nthe day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.\r\n\r\n58:4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist\r\nof wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice\r\nto be heard on high.\r\n\r\n58:5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict\r\nhis soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread\r\nsackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an\r\nacceptable day to the LORD?  58:6 Is not this the fast that I have\r\nchosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,\r\nand to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?  58:7\r\nIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the\r\npoor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that\r\nthou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\r\n58:8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health\r\nshall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before\r\nthee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.\r\n\r\n58:9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry,\r\nand he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee\r\nthe yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; 58:10\r\nAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted\r\nsoul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as\r\nthe noon day: 58:11 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and\r\nsatisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be\r\nlike a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n58:12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:\r\nthou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou\r\nshalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to\r\ndwell in.\r\n\r\n58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy\r\npleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of\r\nthe LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,\r\nnor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: 58:14\r\nThen shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to\r\nride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the\r\nheritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken\r\nit.\r\n\r\n59:1 Behold, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;\r\nneither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: 59:2 But your iniquities\r\nhave separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his\r\nface from you, that he will not hear.\r\n\r\n59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with\r\niniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered\r\nperverseness.\r\n\r\n59:4 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust\r\nin vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n59:5 They hatch cockatrice\xe2\x80\x99 eggs, and weave the spider\xe2\x80\x99s web: he that\r\neateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out\r\ninto a viper.\r\n\r\n59:6 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover\r\nthemselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and\r\nthe act of violence is in their hands.\r\n\r\n59:7 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent\r\nblood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and\r\ndestruction are in their paths.\r\n\r\n59:8 The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their\r\ngoings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein\r\nshall not know peace.\r\n\r\n59:9 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake\r\nus: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we\r\nwalk in darkness.\r\n\r\n59:10 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had\r\nno eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate\r\nplaces as dead men.\r\n\r\n59:11 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for\r\njudgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.\r\n\r\n59:12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins\r\ntestify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our\r\niniquities, we know them; 59:13 In transgressing and lying against the\r\nLORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt,\r\nconceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.\r\n\r\n59:14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar\r\noff: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.\r\n\r\n59:15 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh\r\nhimself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there\r\nwas no judgment.\r\n\r\n59:16 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no\r\nintercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his\r\nrighteousness, it sustained him.\r\n\r\n59:17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of\r\nsalvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for\r\nclothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.\r\n\r\n59:18 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his\r\nadversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay\r\nrecompence.\r\n\r\n59:19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his\r\nglory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a\r\nflood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.\r\n\r\n59:20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn\r\nfrom transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n59:21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My\r\nspirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,\r\nshall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed,\r\nnor out of the mouth of thy seed\xe2\x80\x99s seed, saith the LORD, from\r\nhenceforth and for ever.\r\n\r\n60:1 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is\r\nrisen upon thee.\r\n\r\n60:2 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross\r\ndarkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory\r\nshall be seen upon thee.\r\n\r\n60:3 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the\r\nbrightness of thy rising.\r\n\r\n60:4 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather\r\nthemselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far,\r\nand thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.\r\n\r\n60:5 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall\r\nfear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be\r\nconverted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.\r\n\r\n60:6 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of\r\nMidian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring\r\ngold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.\r\n\r\n60:7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the\r\nrams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with\r\nacceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.\r\n\r\n60:8 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their\r\nwindows?  60:9 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of\r\nTarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their\r\ngold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One\r\nof Israel, because he hath glorified thee.\r\n\r\n60:10 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their\r\nkings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in\r\nmy favour have I had mercy on thee.\r\n\r\n60:11 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be\r\nshut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the\r\nGentiles, and that their kings may be brought.\r\n\r\n60:12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall\r\nperish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.\r\n\r\n60:13 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the\r\npine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my\r\nsanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.\r\n\r\n60:14 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending\r\nunto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down\r\nat the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee; The city of the\r\nLORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\n60:15 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went\r\nthrough thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n60:16 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck\r\nthe breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy\r\nSaviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.\r\n\r\n60:17 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,\r\nand for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers\r\npeace, and thine exactors righteousness.\r\n\r\n60:18 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor\r\ndestruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls\r\nSalvation, and thy gates Praise.\r\n\r\n60:19 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for\r\nbrightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be\r\nunto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.\r\n\r\n60:20 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw\r\nitself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of\r\nthy mourning shall be ended.\r\n\r\n60:21 Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the\r\nland for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I\r\nmay be glorified.\r\n\r\n60:22 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong\r\nnation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.\r\n\r\n61:1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath\r\nanointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to\r\nbind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and\r\nthe opening of the prison to them that are bound; 61:2 To proclaim the\r\nacceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to\r\ncomfort all that mourn; 61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,\r\nto give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the\r\ngarment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be\r\ncalled trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might\r\nbe glorified.\r\n\r\n61:4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the\r\nformer desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the\r\ndesolations of many generations.\r\n\r\n61:5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of\r\nthe alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.\r\n\r\n61:6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you\r\nthe Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and\r\nin their glory shall ye boast yourselves.\r\n\r\n61:7 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall\r\nrejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess\r\nthe double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.\r\n\r\n61:8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering;\r\nand I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting\r\ncovenant with them.\r\n\r\n61:9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their\r\noffspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them,\r\nthat they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.\r\n\r\n61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in\r\nmy God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath\r\ncovered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh\r\nhimself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her\r\njewels.\r\n\r\n61:11 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden\r\ncauseth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord\r\nGOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n62:1 For Zion\xe2\x80\x99s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as\r\nbrightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.\r\n\r\n62:2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy\r\nglory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the\r\nLORD shall name.\r\n\r\n62:3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and\r\na royal diadem in the hand of thy God.\r\n\r\n62:4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any\r\nmore be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy\r\nland Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n62:5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry\r\nthee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God\r\nrejoice over thee.\r\n\r\n62:6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall\r\nnever hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the\r\nLORD, keep not silence, 62:7 And give him no rest, till he establish,\r\nand till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.\r\n\r\n62:8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his\r\nstrength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine\r\nenemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for\r\nthe which thou hast laboured: 62:9 But they that have gathered it\r\nshall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it\r\ntogether shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.\r\n\r\n62:10 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the\r\npeople; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a\r\nstandard for the people.\r\n\r\n62:11 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say\r\nye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his\r\nreward is with him, and his work before him.\r\n\r\n62:12 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the\r\nLORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.\r\n\r\n63:1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from\r\nBozrah?  this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the\r\ngreatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to\r\nsave.\r\n\r\n63:2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like\r\nhim that treadeth in the winefat?  63:3 I have trodden the winepress\r\nalone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them\r\nin mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be\r\nsprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.\r\n\r\n63:4 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my\r\nredeemed is come.\r\n\r\n63:5 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that\r\nthere was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation\r\nunto me; and my fury, it upheld me.\r\n\r\n63:6 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them\r\ndrunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.\r\n\r\n63:7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises\r\nof the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and\r\nthe great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed\r\non them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of\r\nhis lovingkindnesses.\r\n\r\n63:8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not\r\nlie: so he was their Saviour.\r\n\r\n63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his\r\npresence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and\r\nhe bare them, and carried them all the days of old.\r\n\r\n63:10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was\r\nturned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.\r\n\r\n63:11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,\r\nsaying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the\r\nshepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within\r\nhim?  63:12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious\r\narm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting\r\nname?  63:13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the\r\nwilderness, that they should not stumble?  63:14 As a beast goeth down\r\ninto the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst\r\nthou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.\r\n\r\n63:15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy\r\nholiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the\r\nsounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they\r\nrestrained?  63:16 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be\r\nignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our\r\nfather, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.\r\n\r\n63:17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened\r\nour heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants\xe2\x80\x99 sake, the tribes of\r\nthine inheritance.\r\n\r\n63:18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while:\r\nour adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.\r\n\r\n63:19 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not\r\ncalled by thy name.\r\n\r\n64:1 Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come\r\ndown, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 64:2 As when\r\nthe melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make\r\nthy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at\r\nthy presence!  64:3 When thou didst terrible things which we looked\r\nnot for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.\r\n\r\n64:4 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor\r\nperceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,\r\nwhat he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.\r\n\r\n64:5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those\r\nthat remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have\r\nsinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.\r\n\r\n64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses\r\nare as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities,\r\nlike the wind, have taken us away.\r\n\r\n64:7 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up\r\nhimself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and\r\nhast consumed us, because of our iniquities.\r\n\r\n64:8 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou\r\nour potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.\r\n\r\n64:9 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for\r\never: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.\r\n\r\n64:10 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,\r\nJerusalem a desolation.\r\n\r\n64:11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised\r\nthee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n64:12 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou\r\nhold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?  65:1 I am sought of them\r\nthat asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said,\r\nBehold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.\r\n\r\n65:2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,\r\nwhich walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;\r\n65:3 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that\r\nsacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 65:4\r\nWhich remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat\r\nswine\xe2\x80\x99s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;\r\n65:5 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier\r\nthan thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n65:6 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but\r\nwill recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 65:7 Your\r\niniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the\r\nLORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me\r\nupon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n65:8 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and\r\none saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for\r\nmy servants\xe2\x80\x99 sakes, that I may not destroy them all.\r\n\r\n65:9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an\r\ninheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my\r\nservants shall dwell there.\r\n\r\n65:10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a\r\nplace for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.\r\n\r\n65:11 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy\r\nmountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the\r\ndrink offering unto that number.\r\n\r\n65:12 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow\r\ndown to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when\r\nI spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did\r\nchoose that wherein I delighted not.\r\n\r\n65:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall\r\neat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye\r\nshall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be\r\nashamed: 65:14 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye\r\nshall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\n65:15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the\r\nLord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name: 65:16\r\nThat he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the\r\nGod of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God\r\nof truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they\r\nare hid from mine eyes.\r\n\r\n65:17 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the\r\nformer shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.\r\n\r\n65:18 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,\r\nbehold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.\r\n\r\n65:19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the\r\nvoice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n65:20 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man\r\nthat hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred\r\nyears old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be\r\naccursed.\r\n\r\n65:21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall\r\nplant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.\r\n\r\n65:22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,\r\nand another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people,\r\nand mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\r\n\r\n65:23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for\r\nthey are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n65:24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;\r\nand while they are yet speaking, I will hear.\r\n\r\n65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall\r\neat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent\xe2\x80\x99s meat. They\r\nshall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n66:1 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my\r\nfootstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the\r\nplace of my rest?  66:2 For all those things hath mine hand made, and\r\nall those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I\r\nlook, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth\r\nat my word.\r\n\r\n66:3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth\r\na lamb, as if he cut off a dog\xe2\x80\x99s neck; he that offereth an oblation,\r\nas if he offered swine\xe2\x80\x99s blood; he that burneth incense, as if he\r\nblessed an idol.\r\n\r\nYea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in\r\ntheir abominations.\r\n\r\n66:4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears\r\nupon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they\r\ndid not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in\r\nwhich I delighted not.\r\n\r\n66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your\r\nbrethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, said,\r\nLet the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they\r\nshall be ashamed.\r\n\r\n66:6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice\r\nof the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.\r\n\r\n66:7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,\r\nshe was delivered of a man child.\r\n\r\n66:8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the\r\nearth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at\r\nonce?  for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.\r\n\r\n66:9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith\r\nthe LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n66:10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that\r\nlove her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 66:11\r\nThat ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her\r\nconsolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the\r\nabundance of her glory.\r\n\r\n66:12 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like\r\na river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then\r\nshall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon\r\nher knees.\r\n\r\n66:13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye\r\nshall be comforted in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n66:14 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones\r\nshall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known\r\ntoward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.\r\n\r\n66:15 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots\r\nlike a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with\r\nflames of fire.\r\n\r\n66:16 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh:\r\nand the slain of the LORD shall be many.\r\n\r\n66:17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the\r\ngardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine\xe2\x80\x99s flesh, and the\r\nabomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n66:18 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I\r\nwill gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n66:19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that\r\nescape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw\r\nthe bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not\r\nheard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my\r\nglory among the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n66:20 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the\r\nLORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters,\r\nand upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,\r\nsaith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean\r\nvessel into the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n66:21 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,\r\nshall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your\r\nname remain.\r\n\r\n66:23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,\r\nand from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship\r\nbefore me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n66:24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men\r\nthat have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die,\r\nneither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring\r\nunto all flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of the Prophet Jeremiah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that\r\nwere in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 1:2 To whom the word of the\r\nLORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the\r\nthirteenth year of his reign.\r\n\r\n1:3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of\r\nJudah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah\r\nking of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the\r\nfifth month.\r\n\r\n1:4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 1:5 Before I\r\nformed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out\r\nof the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n1:6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n1:7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt\r\ngo to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou\r\nshalt speak.\r\n\r\n1:8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the\r\nLORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.\r\n\r\n1:10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the\r\nkingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw\r\ndown, to build, and to plant.\r\n\r\n1:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,\r\nwhat seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.\r\n\r\n1:12 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will\r\nhasten my word to perform it.\r\n\r\n1:13 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,\r\nWhat seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face\r\nthereof is toward the north.\r\n\r\n1:14 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break\r\nforth upon all the inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\n1:15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the\r\nnorth, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every\r\none his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against\r\nall the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n1:16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their\r\nwickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other\r\ngods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.\r\n\r\n1:17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them\r\nall that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I\r\nconfound thee before them.\r\n\r\n1:18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an\r\niron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the\r\nkings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests\r\nthereof, and against the people of the land.\r\n\r\n1:19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail\r\nagainst thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.\r\n\r\n2:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2:2 Go and cry\r\nin the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember\r\nthee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when\r\nthou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.\r\n\r\n2:3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his\r\nincrease: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the\r\nfamilies of the house of Israel: 2:5 Thus saith the LORD, What\r\niniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from\r\nme, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?  2:6 Neither\r\nsaid they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of\r\nEgypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts\r\nand of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death,\r\nthrough a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?\r\n2:7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit\r\nthereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my\r\nland, and made mine heritage an abomination.\r\n\r\n2:8 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the\r\nlaw knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the\r\nprophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n2:9 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s children will I plead.\r\n\r\n2:10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,\r\nand consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.\r\n\r\n2:11 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my\r\npeople have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.\r\n\r\n2:12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be\r\nye very desolate, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the\r\nfountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken\r\ncisterns, that can hold no water.\r\n\r\n2:14 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?\r\n2:15 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his\r\nland waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.\r\n\r\n2:16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of\r\nthy head.\r\n\r\n2:17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast\r\nforsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?  2:18 And now\r\nwhat hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of\r\nSihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the\r\nwaters of the river?  2:19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee,\r\nand thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that\r\nit is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy\r\nGod, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.\r\n\r\n2:20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and\r\nthou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and\r\nunder every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.\r\n\r\n2:21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how\r\nthen art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto\r\nme?  2:22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much\r\nsoap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n2:23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after\r\nBaalim?  see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art\r\na swift dromedary traversing her ways; 2:24 A wild ass used to the\r\nwilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion\r\nwho can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary\r\nthemselves; in her month they shall find her.\r\n\r\n2:25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:\r\nbut thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and\r\nafter them will I go.\r\n\r\n2:26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of\r\nIsrael ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests,\r\nand their prophets.\r\n\r\n2:27 Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast\r\nbrought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not\r\ntheir face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and\r\nsave us.\r\n\r\n2:28 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise,\r\nif they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the\r\nnumber of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.\r\n\r\n2:29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against\r\nme, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:30 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no\r\ncorrection: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a\r\ndestroying lion.\r\n\r\n2:31 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a\r\nwilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people,\r\nWe are lords; we will come no more unto thee?  2:32 Can a maid forget\r\nher ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me\r\ndays without number.\r\n\r\n2:33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also\r\ntaught the wicked ones thy ways.\r\n\r\n2:34 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor\r\ninnocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.\r\n\r\n2:35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall\r\nturn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I\r\nhave not sinned.\r\n\r\n2:36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt\r\nbe ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.\r\n\r\n2:37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine\r\nhead: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not\r\nprosper in them.\r\n\r\n3:1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and\r\nbecome another man\xe2\x80\x99s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that\r\nland be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many\r\nlovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast\r\nnot been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian\r\nin the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms\r\nand with thy wickedness.\r\n\r\n3:3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no\r\nlatter rain; and thou hadst a whore\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, thou refusedst to be\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n3:4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the\r\nguide of my youth?  3:5 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he\r\nkeep it to the end?  Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as\r\nthou couldest.\r\n\r\n3:6 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast\r\nthou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon\r\nevery high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played\r\nthe harlot.\r\n\r\n3:7 And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me.\r\nBut she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.\r\n\r\n3:8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel\r\ncommitted adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of\r\ndivorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and\r\nplayed the harlot also.\r\n\r\n3:9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that\r\nshe defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\n3:10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned\r\nunto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:11 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified\r\nherself more than treacherous Judah.\r\n\r\n3:12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,\r\nthou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine\r\nanger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will\r\nnot keep anger for ever.\r\n\r\n3:13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed\r\nagainst the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers\r\nunder every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n3:14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married\r\nunto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and\r\nI will bring you to Zion: 3:15 And I will give you pastors according\r\nto mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.\r\n\r\n3:16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in\r\nthe land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The\r\nark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind:\r\nneither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither\r\nshall that be done any more.\r\n\r\n3:17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;\r\nand all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the\r\nLORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the\r\nimagination of their evil heart.\r\n\r\n3:18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of\r\nIsrael, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to\r\nthe land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.\r\n\r\n3:19 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give\r\nthee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I\r\nsaid, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.\r\n\r\n3:20 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so\r\nhave ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n3:21 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications\r\nof the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they\r\nhave forgotten the LORD their God.\r\n\r\n3:22 Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your\r\nbackslidings.\r\n\r\nBehold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n3:23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the\r\nmultitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n3:24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth;\r\ntheir flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.\r\n\r\n3:25 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we\r\nhave sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our\r\nyouth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD\r\nour God.\r\n\r\n4:1 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and\r\nif thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt\r\nthou not remove.\r\n\r\n4:2 And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and\r\nin righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and\r\nin him shall they glory.\r\n\r\n4:3 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break\r\nup your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.\r\n\r\n4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of\r\nyour heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury\r\ncome forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the\r\nevil of your doings.\r\n\r\n4:5 Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye\r\nthe trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble\r\nyourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.\r\n\r\n4:6 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will\r\nbring evil from the north, and a great destruction.\r\n\r\n4:7 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the\r\nGentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy\r\nland desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an\r\ninhabitant.\r\n\r\n4:8 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce\r\nanger of the LORD is not turned back from us.\r\n\r\n4:9 And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the\r\nheart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the\r\npriests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.\r\n\r\n4:10 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this\r\npeople and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword\r\nreacheth unto the soul.\r\n\r\n4:11 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A\r\ndry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of\r\nmy people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, 4:12 Even a full wind from\r\nthose places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4:13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as\r\na whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we\r\nare spoiled.\r\n\r\n4:14 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest\r\nbe saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?  4:15\r\nFor a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount\r\nEphraim.\r\n\r\n4:16 Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against\r\nJerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their\r\nvoice against the cities of Judah.\r\n\r\n4:17 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because\r\nshe hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:18 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this\r\nis thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto\r\nthine heart.\r\n\r\n4:19 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart\r\nmaketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard,\r\nO my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.\r\n\r\n4:20 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is\r\nspoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.\r\n\r\n4:21 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the\r\ntrumpet?  4:22 For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they\r\nare sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise\r\nto do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.\r\n\r\n4:23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and\r\nthe heavens, and they had no light.\r\n\r\n4:24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills\r\nmoved lightly.\r\n\r\n4:25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the\r\nheavens were fled.\r\n\r\n4:26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all\r\nthe cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and\r\nby his fierce anger.\r\n\r\n4:27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;\r\nyet will I not make a full end.\r\n\r\n4:28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;\r\nbecause I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,\r\nneither will I turn back from it.\r\n\r\n4:29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and\r\nbowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:\r\nevery city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.\r\n\r\n4:30 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou\r\nclothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments\r\nof gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt\r\nthou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek\r\nthy life.\r\n\r\n4:31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the\r\nanguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of\r\nthe daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her\r\nhands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of\r\nmurderers.\r\n\r\n5:1 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now,\r\nand know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man,\r\nif there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I\r\nwill pardon it.\r\n\r\n5:2 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.\r\n\r\n5:3 O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken\r\nthem, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they\r\nhave refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder\r\nthan a rock; they have refused to return.\r\n\r\n5:4 Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for\r\nthey know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.\r\n\r\n5:5 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for\r\nthey have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God:\r\nbut these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.\r\n\r\n5:6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of\r\nthe evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their\r\ncities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces:\r\nbecause their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n5:7 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me,\r\nand sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full,\r\nthey then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in\r\nthe harlots\xe2\x80\x99 houses.\r\n\r\n5:8 They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after\r\nhis neighbours wife.\r\n\r\n5:9 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not\r\nmy soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  5:10 Go ye up upon her\r\nwalls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her\r\nbattlements; for they are not the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n5:11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very\r\ntreacherously against me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:12 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall\r\nevil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 5:13 And the\r\nprophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it\r\nbe done unto them.\r\n\r\n5:14 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this\r\nword, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people\r\nwood, and it shall devour them.\r\n\r\n5:15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,\r\nsaith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a\r\nnation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what\r\nthey say.\r\n\r\n5:16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.\r\n\r\n5:17 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy\r\nsons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and\r\nthine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall\r\nimpoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.\r\n\r\n5:18 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a\r\nfull end with you.\r\n\r\n5:19 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the\r\nLORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them,\r\nLike as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so\r\nshall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.\r\n\r\n5:20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,\r\nsaying, 5:21 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without\r\nunderstanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear\r\nnot: 5:22 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my\r\npresence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a\r\nperpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof\r\ntoss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can\r\nthey not pass over it?  5:23 But this people hath a revolting and a\r\nrebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.\r\n\r\n5:24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our\r\nGod, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season:\r\nhe reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.\r\n\r\n5:25 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have\r\nwithholden good things from you.\r\n\r\n5:26 For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he\r\nthat setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.\r\n\r\n5:27 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:\r\ntherefore they are become great, and waxen rich.\r\n\r\n5:28 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of\r\nthe wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet\r\nthey prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.\r\n\r\n5:29 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my\r\nsoul be avenged on such a nation as this?  5:30 A wonderful and\r\nhorrible thing is committed in the land; 5:31 The prophets prophesy\r\nfalsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love\r\nto have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?  6:1 O ye\r\nchildren of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of\r\nJerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in\r\nBethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n6:2 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n6:3 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall\r\npitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one\r\nin his place.\r\n\r\n6:4 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe\r\nunto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are\r\nstretched out.\r\n\r\n6:5 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.\r\n\r\n6:6 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast\r\na mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is\r\nwholly oppression in the midst of her.\r\n\r\n6:7 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her\r\nwickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually\r\nis grief and wounds.\r\n\r\n6:8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee;\r\nlest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.\r\n\r\n6:9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the\r\nremnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer\r\ninto the baskets.\r\n\r\n6:10 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?\r\nbehold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold,\r\nthe word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n6:11 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with\r\nholding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the\r\nassembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife\r\nshall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.\r\n\r\n6:12 And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields\r\nand wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the\r\ninhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every\r\none is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the\r\npriest every one dealeth falsely.\r\n\r\n6:14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people\r\nslightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.\r\n\r\n6:15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they\r\nwere not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they\r\nshall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they\r\nshall be cast down, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for\r\nthe old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall\r\nfind rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.\r\n\r\n6:17 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the\r\ntrumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.\r\n\r\n6:18 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n6:19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even\r\nthe fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my\r\nwords, nor to my law, but rejected it.\r\n\r\n6:20 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the\r\nsweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not\r\nacceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.\r\n\r\n6:21 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks\r\nbefore this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall\r\nupon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.\r\n\r\n6:22 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north\r\ncountry, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n6:23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no\r\nmercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses,\r\nset in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.\r\n\r\n6:24 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish\r\nhath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.\r\n\r\n6:25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword\r\nof the enemy and fear is on every side.\r\n\r\n6:26 O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow\r\nthyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter\r\nlamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.\r\n\r\n6:27 I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that\r\nthou mayest know and try their way.\r\n\r\n6:28 They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are\r\nbrass and iron; they are all corrupters.\r\n\r\n6:29 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the\r\nfounder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.\r\n\r\n6:30 Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath\r\nrejected them.\r\n\r\n7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 7:2 Stand in\r\nthe gate of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, and proclaim there this word, and say,\r\nHear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these\r\ngates to worship the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:3 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways\r\nand your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.\r\n\r\n7:4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The\r\ntemple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.\r\n\r\n7:5 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye\r\nthroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; 7:6 If ye\r\noppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not\r\ninnocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your\r\nhurt: 7:7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land\r\nthat I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n7:8 Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.\r\n\r\n7:9 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and\r\nburn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;\r\n7:10 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my\r\nname, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?  7:11 Is\r\nthis house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in\r\nyour eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:12 But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my\r\nname at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my\r\npeople Israel.\r\n\r\n7:13 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD,\r\nand I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not;\r\nand I called you, but ye answered not; 7:14 Therefore will I do unto\r\nthis house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the\r\nplace which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to\r\nShiloh.\r\n\r\n7:15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your\r\nbrethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.\r\n\r\n7:16 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor\r\nprayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n7:17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the\r\nstreets of Jerusalem?  7:18 The children gather wood, and the fathers\r\nkindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the\r\nqueen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that\r\nthey may provoke me to anger.\r\n\r\n7:19 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke\r\nthemselves to the confusion of their own faces?  7:20 Therefore thus\r\nsaith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out\r\nupon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the\r\nfield, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall\r\nnot be quenched.\r\n\r\n7:21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt\r\nofferings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.\r\n\r\n7:22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day\r\nthat I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt\r\nofferings or sacrifices: 7:23 But this thing commanded I them, saying,\r\nObey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and\r\nwalk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well\r\nunto you.\r\n\r\n7:24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the\r\ncounsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went\r\nbackward, and not forward.\r\n\r\n7:25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of\r\nEgypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the\r\nprophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 7:26 Yet they\r\nhearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their\r\nneck: they did worse than their fathers.\r\n\r\n7:27 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they\r\nwill not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they\r\nwill not answer thee.\r\n\r\n7:28 But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not\r\nthe voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is\r\nperished, and is cut off from their mouth.\r\n\r\n7:29 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a\r\nlamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken\r\nthe generation of his wrath.\r\n\r\n7:30 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the\r\nLORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by\r\nmy name, to pollute it.\r\n\r\n7:31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the\r\nvalley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in\r\nthe fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.\r\n\r\n7:32 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall\r\nno more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the\r\nvalley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n7:33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of\r\nthe heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them\r\naway.\r\n\r\n7:34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the\r\nstreets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness,\r\nthe voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land\r\nshall be desolate.\r\n\r\n8:1 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of\r\nthe kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the\r\npriests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: 8:2 And they shall\r\nspread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven,\r\nwhom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they\r\nhave walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped:\r\nthey shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\n8:3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of\r\nthem that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places\r\nwhither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n8:4 Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they\r\nfall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?  8:5 Why then\r\nis this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?\r\nthey hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.\r\n\r\n8:6 I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented\r\nhim of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to\r\nhis course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.\r\n\r\n8:7 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the\r\nturtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming;\r\nbut my people know not the judgment of the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:8 How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?\r\nLo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.\r\n\r\n8:9 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they\r\nhave rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?  8:10\r\nTherefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to\r\nthem that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto\r\nthe greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the\r\npriest every one dealeth falsely.\r\n\r\n8:11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people\r\nslightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.\r\n\r\n8:12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they\r\nwere not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall\r\nthey fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they\r\nshall be cast down, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:13 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no\r\ngrapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade;\r\nand the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.\r\n\r\n8:14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into\r\nthe defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God\r\nhath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because\r\nwe have sinned against the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:15 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health,\r\nand behold trouble!  8:16 The snorting of his horses was heard from\r\nDan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his\r\nstrong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all\r\nthat is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.\r\n\r\n8:17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which\r\nwill not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in\r\nme.\r\n\r\n8:19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because\r\nof them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not\r\nher king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven\r\nimages, and with strange vanities?  8:20 The harvest is past, the\r\nsummer is ended, and we are not saved.\r\n\r\n8:21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;\r\nastonishment hath taken hold on me.\r\n\r\n8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then\r\nis not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?  9:1 Oh that\r\nmy head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might\r\nweep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!  9:2 Oh\r\nthat I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I\r\nmight leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers,\r\nan assembly of treacherous men.\r\n\r\n9:3 And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are\r\nnot valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil\r\nto evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:4 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any\r\nbrother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour\r\nwill walk with slanders.\r\n\r\n9:5 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak\r\nthe truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary\r\nthemselves to commit iniquity.\r\n\r\n9:6 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they\r\nrefuse to know me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:7 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them,\r\nand try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?  9:8\r\nTheir tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh\r\npeaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n9:9 Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not\r\nmy soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  9:10 For the mountains\r\nwill I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the\r\nwilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can\r\npass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both\r\nthe fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.\r\n\r\n9:11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will\r\nmake the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.\r\n\r\n9:12 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to\r\nwhom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for\r\nwhat the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none\r\npasseth through?  9:13 And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken\r\nmy law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither\r\nwalked therein; 9:14 But have walked after the imagination of their\r\nown heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them: 9:15\r\nTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I\r\nwill feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water\r\nof gall to drink.\r\n\r\n9:16 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor\r\ntheir fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I\r\nhave consumed them.\r\n\r\n9:17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the\r\nmourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that\r\nthey may come: 9:18 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for\r\nus, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out\r\nwith waters.\r\n\r\n9:19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled!\r\nwe are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because\r\nour dwellings have cast us out.\r\n\r\n9:20 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear\r\nreceive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and\r\nevery one her neighbour lamentation.\r\n\r\n9:21 For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our\r\npalaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n9:22 Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall\r\nas dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman,\r\nand none shall gather them.\r\n\r\n9:23 Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\r\nneither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man\r\nglory in his riches: 9:24 But let him that glorieth glory in this,\r\nthat he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which\r\nexercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth:\r\nfor in these things I delight, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:25 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all\r\nthem which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; 9:26 Egypt, and\r\nJudah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are\r\nin the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these\r\nnations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are\r\nuncircumcised in the heart.\r\n\r\n10:1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of\r\nIsrael: 10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen,\r\nand be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are\r\ndismayed at them.\r\n\r\n10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree\r\nout of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.\r\n\r\n10:4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails\r\nand with hammers, that it move not.\r\n\r\n10:5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs\r\nbe borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they\r\ncannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.\r\n\r\n10:6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art\r\ngreat, and thy name is great in might.\r\n\r\n10:7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it\r\nappertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in\r\nall their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.\r\n\r\n10:8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a\r\ndoctrine of vanities.\r\n\r\n10:9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from\r\nUphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue\r\nand purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.\r\n\r\n10:10 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an\r\neverlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the\r\nnations shall not be able to abide his indignation.\r\n\r\n10:11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the\r\nheavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from\r\nunder these heavens.\r\n\r\n10:12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the\r\nworld by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n10:13 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in\r\nthe heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the\r\nearth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out\r\nof his treasures.\r\n\r\n10:14 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is\r\nconfounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and\r\nthere is no breath in them.\r\n\r\n10:15 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their\r\nvisitation they shall perish.\r\n\r\n10:16 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of\r\nall things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of\r\nhosts is his name.\r\n\r\n10:17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n10:18 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the\r\ninhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that\r\nthey may find it so.\r\n\r\n10:19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly\r\nthis is a grief, and I must bear it.\r\n\r\n10:20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my\r\nchildren are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to\r\nstretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.\r\n\r\n10:21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the\r\nLORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\n10:22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion\r\nout of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a\r\nden of dragons.\r\n\r\n10:23 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not\r\nin man that walketh to direct his steps.\r\n\r\n10:24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest\r\nthou bring me to nothing.\r\n\r\n10:25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon\r\nthe families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob,\r\nand devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\n11:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying, 11:2 Hear ye\r\nthe words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to\r\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem; 11:3 And say thou unto them, Thus saith\r\nthe LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words\r\nof this covenant, 11:4 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that\r\nI brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace,\r\nsaying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command\r\nyou: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: 11:5 That I may\r\nperform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a\r\nland flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I,\r\nand said, So be it, O LORD.\r\n\r\n11:6 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the\r\ncities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the\r\nwords of this covenant, and do them.\r\n\r\n11:7 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I\r\nbrought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising\r\nearly and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.\r\n\r\n11:8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one\r\nin the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon\r\nthem all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but\r\nthey did them not.\r\n\r\n11:9 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of\r\nJudah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n11:10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,\r\nwhich refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to\r\nserve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my\r\ncovenant which I made with their fathers.\r\n\r\n11:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon\r\nthem, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall\r\ncry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.\r\n\r\n11:12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,\r\nand cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not\r\nsave them at all in the time of their trouble.\r\n\r\n11:13 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O\r\nJudah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye\r\nset up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto\r\nBaal.\r\n\r\n11:14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry\r\nor prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry\r\nunto me for their trouble.\r\n\r\n11:15 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath\r\nwrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee?\r\nwhen thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.\r\n\r\n11:16 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of\r\ngoodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire\r\nupon it, and the branches of it are broken.\r\n\r\n11:17 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil\r\nagainst thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of\r\nJudah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger\r\nin offering incense unto Baal.\r\n\r\n11:18 And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then\r\nthou shewedst me their doings.\r\n\r\n11:19 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter;\r\nand I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let\r\nus destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off\r\nfrom the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.\r\n\r\n11:20 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the\r\nreins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee\r\nhave I revealed my cause.\r\n\r\n11:21 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek\r\nthy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die\r\nnot by our hand: 11:22 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold,\r\nI will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons\r\nand their daughters shall die by famine: 11:23 And there shall be no\r\nremnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even\r\nthe year of their visitation.\r\n\r\n12:1 Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me\r\ntalk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked\r\nprosper?  wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?\r\n12:2 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,\r\nyea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far\r\nfrom their reins.\r\n\r\n12:3 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine\r\nheart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and\r\nprepare them for the day of slaughter.\r\n\r\n12:4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field\r\nwither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are\r\nconsumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last\r\nend.\r\n\r\n12:5 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,\r\nthen how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace,\r\nwherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in\r\nthe swelling of Jordan?  12:6 For even thy brethren, and the house of\r\nthy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they\r\nhave called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they\r\nspeak fair words unto thee.\r\n\r\n12:7 I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have\r\ngiven the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.\r\n\r\n12:8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out\r\nagainst me: therefore have I hated it.\r\n\r\n12:9 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round\r\nabout are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field,\r\ncome to devour.\r\n\r\n12:10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my\r\nportion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n12:11 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto\r\nme; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n12:12 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the\r\nwilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of\r\nthe land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.\r\n\r\n12:13 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put\r\nthemselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of\r\nyour revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:14 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch\r\nthe inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit;\r\nBehold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house\r\nof Judah from among them.\r\n\r\n12:15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I\r\nwill return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again,\r\nevery man to his heritage, and every man to his land.\r\n\r\n12:16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the\r\nways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they\r\ntaught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the\r\nmidst of my people.\r\n\r\n12:17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy\r\nthat nation, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:1 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and\r\nput it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.\r\n\r\n13:2 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it\r\non my loins.\r\n\r\n13:3 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,\r\n13:4 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and\r\narise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.\r\n\r\n13:5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.\r\n\r\n13:6 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,\r\nArise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I\r\ncommanded thee to hide there.\r\n\r\n13:7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from\r\nthe place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it\r\nwas profitable for nothing.\r\n\r\n13:8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:9 Thus saith\r\nthe LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the\r\ngreat pride of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n13:10 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in\r\nthe imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve\r\nthem, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good\r\nfor nothing.\r\n\r\n13:11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I\r\ncaused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house\r\nof Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and\r\nfor a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n13:12 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the\r\nLORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they\r\nshall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall\r\nbe filled with wine?  13:13 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith\r\nthe LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even\r\nthe kings that sit upon David\xe2\x80\x99s throne, and the priests, and the\r\nprophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.\r\n\r\n13:14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and\r\nthe sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor\r\nhave mercy, but destroy them.\r\n\r\n13:15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.\r\n\r\n13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and\r\nbefore your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look\r\nfor light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n13:17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places\r\nfor your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears,\r\nbecause the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s flock is carried away captive.\r\n\r\n13:18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:\r\nfor your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.\r\n\r\n13:19 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open\r\nthem: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be\r\nwholly carried away captive.\r\n\r\n13:20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:\r\nwhere is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?  13:21\r\nWhat wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught\r\nthem to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take\r\nthee, as a woman in travail?  13:22 And if thou say in thine heart,\r\nWherefore come these things upon me?  For the greatness of thine\r\niniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.\r\n\r\n13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?\r\nthen may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.\r\n\r\n13:24 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away\r\nby the wind of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n13:25 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the\r\nLORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.\r\n\r\n13:26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy\r\nshame may appear.\r\n\r\n13:27 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of\r\nthy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe\r\nunto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it\r\nonce be?  14:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning\r\nthe dearth.\r\n\r\n14:2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black\r\nunto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.\r\n\r\n14:3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they\r\ncame to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels\r\nempty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.\r\n\r\n14:4 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth,\r\nthe plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.\r\n\r\n14:5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because\r\nthere was no grass.\r\n\r\n14:6 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up\r\nthe wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n14:7 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for\r\nthy name\xe2\x80\x99s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n14:8 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why\r\nshouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man\r\nthat turneth aside to tarry for a night?  14:9 Why shouldest thou be\r\nas a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD,\r\nart in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.\r\n\r\n14:10 Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to\r\nwander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth\r\nnot accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their\r\nsins.\r\n\r\n14:11 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n14:12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer\r\nburnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will\r\nconsume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.\r\n\r\n14:13 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,\r\nYe shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will\r\ngive you assured peace in this place.\r\n\r\n14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my\r\nname: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake\r\nunto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a\r\nthing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.\r\n\r\n14:15 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that\r\nprophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and\r\nfamine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those\r\nprophets be consumed.\r\n\r\n14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the\r\nstreets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they\r\nshall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor\r\ntheir daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.\r\n\r\n14:17 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run\r\ndown with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin\r\ndaughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very\r\ngrievous blow.\r\n\r\n14:18 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the\r\nsword!  and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick\r\nwith famine!  yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a\r\nland that they know not.\r\n\r\n14:19 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why\r\nhast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for\r\npeace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold\r\ntrouble!  14:20 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the\r\niniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.\r\n\r\n14:21 Do not abhor us, for thy name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, do not disgrace the throne\r\nof thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.\r\n\r\n14:22 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause\r\nrain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our\r\nGod?  therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n15:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before\r\nme, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my\r\nsight, and let them go forth.\r\n\r\n15:2 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall\r\nwe go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as\r\nare for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword;\r\nand such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the\r\ncaptivity, to the captivity.\r\n\r\n15:3 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the\r\nsword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and\r\nthe beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.\r\n\r\n15:4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the\r\nearth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that\r\nwhich he did in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n15:5 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall\r\nbemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?  15:6 Thou\r\nhast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore\r\nwill I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary\r\nwith repenting.\r\n\r\n15:7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will\r\nbereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return\r\nnot from their ways.\r\n\r\n15:8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I\r\nhave brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler\r\nat noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors\r\nupon the city.\r\n\r\n15:9 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the\r\nghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been\r\nashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the\r\nsword before their enemies, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n15:10 Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife\r\nand a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on\r\nusury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth\r\ncurse me.\r\n\r\n15:11 The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily\r\nI will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in\r\nthe time of affliction.\r\n\r\n15:12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?  15:13 Thy\r\nsubstance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price,\r\nand that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.\r\n\r\n15:14 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land\r\nwhich thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which\r\nshall burn upon you.\r\n\r\n15:15 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me\r\nof my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that\r\nfor thy sake I have suffered rebuke.\r\n\r\n15:16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto\r\nme the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O\r\nLORD God of hosts.\r\n\r\n15:17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat\r\nalone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.\r\n\r\n15:18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth\r\nto be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters\r\nthat fail?  15:19 Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then\r\nwill I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou\r\ntake forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let\r\nthem return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.\r\n\r\n15:20 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and\r\nthey shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against\r\nthee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n15:21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I\r\nwill redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.\r\n\r\n16:1 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 16:2 Thou shalt\r\nnot take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n16:3 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the\r\ndaughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers\r\nthat bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this\r\nland; 16:4 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be\r\nlamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon\r\nthe face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by\r\nfamine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and\r\nfor the beasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n16:5 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,\r\nneither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace\r\nfrom this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.\r\n\r\n16:6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall\r\nnot be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves,\r\nnor make themselves bald for them: 16:7 Neither shall men tear\r\nthemselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither\r\nshall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father\r\nor for their mother.\r\n\r\n16:8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with\r\nthem to eat and to drink.\r\n\r\n16:9 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I\r\nwill cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days,\r\nthe voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the\r\nbridegroom, and the voice of the bride.\r\n\r\n16:10 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all\r\nthese words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD\r\npronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or\r\nwhat is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?\r\n16:11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have\r\nforsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and\r\nhave served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and\r\nhave not kept my law; 16:12 And ye have done worse than your fathers;\r\nfor, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil\r\nheart, that they may not hearken unto me: 16:13 Therefore will I cast\r\nyou out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your\r\nfathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I\r\nwill not shew you favour.\r\n\r\n16:14 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall\r\nno more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of\r\nIsrael out of the land of Egypt; 16:15 But, The LORD liveth, that\r\nbrought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from\r\nall the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again\r\ninto their land that I gave unto their fathers.\r\n\r\n16:16 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they\r\nshall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they\r\nshall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of\r\nthe holes of the rocks.\r\n\r\n16:17 For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my\r\nface, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.\r\n\r\n16:18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;\r\nbecause they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance\r\nwith the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.\r\n\r\n16:19 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day\r\nof affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the\r\nearth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity,\r\nand things wherein there is no profit.\r\n\r\n16:20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?  16:21\r\nTherefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause\r\nthem to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name\r\nis The LORD.\r\n\r\n17:1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the\r\npoint of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and\r\nupon the horns of your altars; 17:2 Whilst their children remember\r\ntheir altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.\r\n\r\n17:3 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy\r\ntreasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all\r\nthy borders.\r\n\r\n17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage\r\nthat I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the\r\nland which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger,\r\nwhich shall burn for ever.\r\n\r\n17:5 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and\r\nmaketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.\r\n\r\n17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see\r\nwhen good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the\r\nwilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.\r\n\r\n17:7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the\r\nLORD is.\r\n\r\n17:8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that\r\nspreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat\r\ncometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the\r\nyear of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.\r\n\r\n17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:\r\nwho can know it?  17:10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins,\r\neven to give every man according to his ways, and according to the\r\nfruit of his doings.\r\n\r\n17:11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he\r\nthat getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst\r\nof his days, and at his end shall be a fool.\r\n\r\n17:12 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n17:13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be\r\nashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth,\r\nbecause they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.\r\n\r\n17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be\r\nsaved: for thou art my praise.\r\n\r\n17:15 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it\r\ncome now.\r\n\r\n17:16 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow\r\nthee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which\r\ncame out of my lips was right before thee.\r\n\r\n17:17 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.\r\n\r\n17:18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be\r\nconfounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring\r\nupon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.\r\n\r\n17:19 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the\r\nchildren of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the\r\nwhich they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; 17:20 And say\r\nunto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all\r\nJudah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these\r\ngates: 17:21 Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no\r\nburden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;\r\n17:22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath\r\nday, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I\r\ncommanded your fathers.\r\n\r\n17:23 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their\r\nneck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.\r\n\r\n17:24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,\r\nsaith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city\r\non the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;\r\n17:25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and\r\nprinces sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on\r\nhorses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants\r\nof Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.\r\n\r\n17:26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the\r\nplaces about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the\r\nplain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt\r\nofferings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and\r\nbringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n17:27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,\r\nand not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem\r\non the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof,\r\nand it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be\r\nquenched.\r\n\r\n18:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 18:2\r\nArise, and go down to the potter\xe2\x80\x99s house, and there I will cause thee\r\nto hear my words.\r\n\r\n18:3 Then I went down to the potter\xe2\x80\x99s house, and, behold, he wrought a\r\nwork on the wheels.\r\n\r\n18:4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the\r\npotter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the\r\npotter to make it.\r\n\r\n18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18:6 O house of\r\nIsrael, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold,\r\nas the clay is in the potter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\n18:7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning\r\na kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; 18:8 If\r\nthat nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I\r\nwill repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.\r\n\r\n18:9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and\r\nconcerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 18:10 If it do evil in\r\nmy sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good,\r\nwherewith I said I would benefit them.\r\n\r\n18:11 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame\r\nevil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every\r\none from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.\r\n\r\n18:12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own\r\ndevices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.\r\n\r\n18:13 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who\r\nhath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n18:14 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock\r\nof the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another\r\nplace be forsaken?  18:15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they\r\nhave burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in\r\ntheir ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast\r\nup; 18:16 To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every\r\none that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.\r\n\r\n18:17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I\r\nwill shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\n18:18 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;\r\nfor the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the\r\nwise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with\r\nthe tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.\r\n\r\n18:19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that\r\ncontend with me.\r\n\r\n18:20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit\r\nfor my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them,\r\nand to turn away thy wrath from them.\r\n\r\n18:21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out\r\ntheir blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved\r\nof their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death;\r\nlet their young men be slain by the sword in battle.\r\n\r\n18:22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a\r\ntroop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and\r\nhid snares for my feet.\r\n\r\n18:23 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:\r\nforgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight,\r\nbut let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the\r\ntime of thine anger.\r\n\r\n19:1 Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter\xe2\x80\x99s earthen bottle, and\r\ntake of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the\r\npriests; 19:2 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which\r\nis by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I\r\nshall tell thee, 19:3 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings\r\nof Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts,\r\nthe God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the\r\nwhich whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.\r\n\r\n19:4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and\r\nhave burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their\r\nfathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place\r\nwith the blood of innocents; 19:5 They have built also the high places\r\nof Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal,\r\nwhich I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:\r\n19:6 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place\r\nshall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom,\r\nbut The valley of slaughter.\r\n\r\n19:7 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this\r\nplace; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their\r\nenemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their\r\ncarcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for\r\nthe beasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n19:8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one\r\nthat passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the\r\nplagues thereof.\r\n\r\n19:9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the\r\nflesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of\r\nhis friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and\r\nthey that seek their lives, shall straiten them.\r\n\r\n19:10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go\r\nwith thee, 19:11 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of\r\nhosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh\r\na potter\xe2\x80\x99s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall\r\nbury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.\r\n\r\n19:12 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the\r\ninhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet: 19:13 And the\r\nhouses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be\r\ndefiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose\r\nroofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have\r\npoured out drink offerings unto other gods.\r\n\r\n19:14 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to\r\nprophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house; and said to\r\nall the people, 19:15 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;\r\nBehold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the\r\nevil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened\r\ntheir necks, that they might not hear my words.\r\n\r\n20:1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief\r\ngovernor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n20:2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks\r\nthat were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n20:3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth\r\nJeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath\r\nnot called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.\r\n\r\n20:4 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to\r\nthyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of\r\ntheir enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all\r\nJudah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them\r\ncaptive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.\r\n\r\n20:5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all\r\nthe labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the\r\ntreasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their\r\nenemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\n20:6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into\r\ncaptivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die,\r\nand shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou\r\nhast prophesied lies.\r\n\r\n20:7 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art\r\nstronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one\r\nmocketh me.\r\n\r\n20:8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;\r\nbecause the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a\r\nderision, daily.\r\n\r\n20:9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more\r\nin his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up\r\nin my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.\r\n\r\n20:10 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,\r\nsay they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my\r\nhalting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail\r\nagainst him, and we shall take our revenge on him.\r\n\r\n20:11 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my\r\npersecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be\r\ngreatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting\r\nconfusion shall never be forgotten.\r\n\r\n20:12 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the\r\nreins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee\r\nhave I opened my cause.\r\n\r\n20:13 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered\r\nthe soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.\r\n\r\n20:14 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my\r\nmother bare me be blessed.\r\n\r\n20:15 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A\r\nman child is born unto thee; making him very glad.\r\n\r\n20:16 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and\r\nrepented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the\r\nshouting at noontide; 20:17 Because he slew me not from the womb; or\r\nthat my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always\r\ngreat with me.\r\n\r\n20:18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,\r\nthat my days should be consumed with shame?  21:1 The word which came\r\nunto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur\r\nthe son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest,\r\nsaying, 21:2 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that\r\nthe LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that\r\nhe may go up from us.\r\n\r\n21:3 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 21:4\r\nThus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the\r\nweapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the\r\nking of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without\r\nthe walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.\r\n\r\n21:5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and\r\nwith a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.\r\n\r\n21:6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and\r\nbeast: they shall die of a great pestilence.\r\n\r\n21:7 And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of\r\nJudah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this\r\ncity from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into\r\nthe hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their\r\nenemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall\r\nsmite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them,\r\nneither have pity, nor have mercy.\r\n\r\n21:8 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,\r\nI set before you the way of life, and the way of death.\r\n\r\n21:9 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the\r\nfamine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to\r\nthe Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be\r\nunto him for a prey.\r\n\r\n21:10 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for\r\ngood, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of\r\nBabylon, and he shall burn it with fire.\r\n\r\n21:11 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the\r\nword of the LORD; 21:12 O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute\r\njudgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the\r\nhand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that\r\nnone can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.\r\n\r\n21:13 Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock\r\nof the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against\r\nus? or who shall enter into our habitations?  21:14 But I will punish\r\nyou according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will\r\nkindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things\r\nround about it.\r\n\r\n22:1 Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah,\r\nand speak there this word, 22:2 And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O\r\nking of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy\r\nservants, and thy people that enter in by these gates: 22:3 Thus saith\r\nthe LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the\r\nspoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no\r\nviolence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed\r\ninnocent blood in this place.\r\n\r\n22:4 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the\r\ngates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in\r\nchariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.\r\n\r\n22:5 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the\r\nLORD, that this house shall become a desolation.\r\n\r\n22:6 For thus saith the LORD unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s house of Judah; Thou art\r\nGilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a\r\nwilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.\r\n\r\n22:7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his\r\nweapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n22:8 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say\r\nevery man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto\r\nthis great city?  22:9 Then they shall answer, Because they have\r\nforsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other\r\ngods, and served them.\r\n\r\n22:10 Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for\r\nhim that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n22:11 For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king\r\nof Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth\r\nout of this place; He shall not return thither any more: 22:12 But he\r\nshall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall\r\nsee this land no more.\r\n\r\n22:13 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his\r\nchambers by wrong; that useth his neighbours service without wages,\r\nand giveth him not for his work; 22:14 That saith, I will build me a\r\nwide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is\r\ncieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.\r\n\r\n22:15 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not\r\nthy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was\r\nwell with him?  22:16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then\r\nit was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:17 But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness,\r\nand for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence,\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n22:18 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of\r\nJosiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my\r\nbrother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah\r\nlord! or, Ah his glory!  22:19 He shall be buried with the burial of\r\nan ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n22:20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and\r\ncry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.\r\n\r\n22:21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not\r\nhear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not\r\nmy voice.\r\n\r\n22:22 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go\r\ninto captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for\r\nall thy wickedness.\r\n\r\n22:23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how\r\ngracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a\r\nwoman in travail!  22:24 As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the\r\nson of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet\r\nwould I pluck thee thence; 22:25 And I will give thee into the hand of\r\nthem that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou\r\nfearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and\r\ninto the hand of the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\n22:26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into\r\nanother country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.\r\n\r\n22:27 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall\r\nthey not return.\r\n\r\n22:28 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel\r\nwherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed,\r\nand are cast into a land which they know not?  22:29 O earth, earth,\r\nearth, hear the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:30 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that\r\nshall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper,\r\nsitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.\r\n\r\n23:1 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my\r\npasture! saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:2 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors\r\nthat feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away,\r\nand have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of\r\nyour doings, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries\r\nwhither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds;\r\nand they shall be fruitful and increase.\r\n\r\n23:4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and\r\nthey shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be\r\nlacking, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto\r\nDavid a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and\r\nshall execute judgment and justice in the earth.\r\n\r\n23:6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:\r\nand this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR\r\nRIGHTEOUSNESS.\r\n\r\n23:7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall\r\nno more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel\r\nout of the land of Egypt; 23:8 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up\r\nand which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north\r\ncountry, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they\r\nshall dwell in their own land.\r\n\r\n23:9 Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my\r\nbones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath\r\novercome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his\r\nholiness.\r\n\r\n23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the\r\nland mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and\r\ntheir course is evil, and their force is not right.\r\n\r\n23:11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I\r\nfound their wickedness, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:12 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the\r\ndarkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring\r\nevil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they\r\nprophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.\r\n\r\n23:14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:\r\nthey commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands\r\nof evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all\r\nof them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n23:15 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;\r\nBehold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water\r\nof gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth\r\ninto all the land.\r\n\r\n23:16 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the\r\nprophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a\r\nvision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye\r\nshall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the\r\nimagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.\r\n\r\n23:18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath\r\nperceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?\r\n23:19 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a\r\ngrievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\n23:20 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed,\r\nand till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter\r\ndays ye shall consider it perfectly.\r\n\r\n23:21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken\r\nto them, yet they prophesied.\r\n\r\n23:22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to\r\nhear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way,\r\nand from the evil of their doings.\r\n\r\n23:23 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?\r\n23:24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?\r\nsaith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my\r\nname, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.\r\n\r\n23:26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that\r\nprophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own\r\nheart; 23:27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their\r\ndreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers\r\nhave forgotten my name for Baal.\r\n\r\n23:28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that\r\nhath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to\r\nthe wheat? saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:29 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer\r\nthat breaketh the rock in pieces?  23:30 Therefore, behold, I am\r\nagainst the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one\r\nfrom his neighbour.\r\n\r\n23:31 Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use\r\ntheir tongues, and say, He saith.\r\n\r\n23:32 Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the\r\nLORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and\r\nby their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore\r\nthey shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:33 And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask\r\nthee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto\r\nthem, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n23:34 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that\r\nshall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n23:35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to\r\nhis brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD\r\nspoken?  23:36 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more:\r\nfor every man\xe2\x80\x99s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the\r\nwords of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.\r\n\r\n23:37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered\r\nthee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?  23:38 But since ye say, The\r\nburden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this\r\nword, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye\r\nshall not say, The burden of the LORD; 23:39 Therefore, behold, I,\r\neven I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city\r\nthat I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:\r\n23:40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a\r\nperpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n24:1 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set\r\nbefore the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of\r\nBabylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of\r\nJudah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from\r\nJerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.\r\n\r\n24:2 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first\r\nripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be\r\neaten, they were so bad.\r\n\r\n24:3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I\r\nsaid, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that\r\ncannot be eaten, they are so evil.\r\n\r\n24:4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5 Thus saith\r\nthe LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I\r\nacknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have\r\nsent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.\r\n\r\n24:6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring\r\nthem again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them\r\ndown; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.\r\n\r\n24:7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and\r\nthey shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall\r\nreturn unto me with their whole heart.\r\n\r\n24:8 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;\r\nsurely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah,\r\nand his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this\r\nland, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 24:9 And I will\r\ndeliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for\r\ntheir hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in\r\nall places whither I shall drive them.\r\n\r\n24:10 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among\r\nthem, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them\r\nand to their fathers.\r\n\r\n25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah\r\nin the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that\r\nwas the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 25:2 The which\r\nJeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all\r\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 25:3 From the thirteenth year of\r\nJosiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the\r\nthree and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and\r\nI have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not\r\nhearkened.\r\n\r\n25:4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,\r\nrising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined\r\nyour ear to hear.\r\n\r\n25:5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and\r\nfrom the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath\r\ngiven unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 25:6 And go not\r\nafter other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me\r\nnot to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.\r\n\r\n25:7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might\r\nprovoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.\r\n\r\n25:8 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard\r\nmy words, 25:9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the\r\nnorth, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my\r\nservant, and will bring them against this land, and against the\r\ninhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and\r\nwill utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an\r\nhissing, and perpetual desolations.\r\n\r\n25:10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice\r\nof gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,\r\nthe sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.\r\n\r\n25:11 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;\r\nand these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.\r\n\r\n25:12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,\r\nthat I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the\r\nLORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make\r\nit perpetual desolations.\r\n\r\n25:13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have\r\npronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which\r\nJeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.\r\n\r\n25:14 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them\r\nalso: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and\r\naccording to the works of their own hands.\r\n\r\n25:15 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup\r\nof this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send\r\nthee, to drink it.\r\n\r\n25:16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the\r\nsword that I will send among them.\r\n\r\n25:17 Then took I the cup at the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and made all the nations\r\nto drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 25:18 To wit, Jerusalem, and\r\nthe cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof,\r\nto make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse;\r\nas it is this day; 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and\r\nhis princes, and all his people; 25:20 And all the mingled people, and\r\nall the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the\r\nPhilistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of\r\nAshdod, 25:21 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 25:22 And all\r\nthe kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the\r\nisles which are beyond the sea, 25:23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and\r\nall that are in the utmost corners, 25:24 And all the kings of Arabia,\r\nand all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,\r\n25:25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all\r\nthe kings of the Medes, 25:26 And all the kings of the north, far and\r\nnear, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are\r\nupon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n25:27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of\r\nhosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and\r\nfall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n25:28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to\r\ndrink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye\r\nshall certainly drink.\r\n\r\n25:29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my\r\nname, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished:\r\nfor I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth,\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n25:30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say\r\nunto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from\r\nhis holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he\r\nshall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the\r\ninhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\n25:31 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD\r\nhath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he\r\nwill give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:32 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from\r\nnation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the\r\ncoasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n25:33 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of\r\nthe earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be\r\nlamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n25:34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,\r\nye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your\r\ndispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n25:35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal\r\nof the flock to escape.\r\n\r\n25:36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the\r\nprincipal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled\r\ntheir pasture.\r\n\r\n25:37 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce\r\nanger of the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is\r\ndesolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of\r\nhis fierce anger.\r\n\r\n26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king\r\nof Judah came this word from the LORD, saying, 26:2 Thus saith the\r\nLORD; Stand in the court of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, and speak unto all the\r\ncities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, all the\r\nwords that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:\r\n26:3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,\r\nthat I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them\r\nbecause of the evil of their doings.\r\n\r\n26:4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not\r\nhearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, 26:5 To\r\nhearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto\r\nyou, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not\r\nhearkened; 26:6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make\r\nthis city a curse to all the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n26:7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah\r\nspeaking these words in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking\r\nall that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that\r\nthe priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou\r\nshalt surely die.\r\n\r\n26:9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This\r\nhouse shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an\r\ninhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the\r\nhouse of the LORD.\r\n\r\n26:10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up\r\nfrom the king\xe2\x80\x99s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the\r\nentry of the new gate of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n26:11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to\r\nall the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath\r\nprophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.\r\n\r\n26:12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,\r\nsaying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against\r\nthis city all the words that ye have heard.\r\n\r\n26:13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the\r\nvoice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil\r\nthat he hath pronounced against you.\r\n\r\n26:14 As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good\r\nand meet unto you.\r\n\r\n26:15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall\r\nsurely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and\r\nupon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me\r\nunto you to speak all these words in your ears.\r\n\r\n26:16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to\r\nthe prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us\r\nin the name of the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n26:17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all\r\nthe assembly of the people, saying, 26:18 Micah the Morasthite\r\nprophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the\r\npeople of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be\r\nplowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the\r\nmountain of the house as the high places of a forest.\r\n\r\n26:19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to\r\ndeath?  did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD\r\nrepented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus\r\nmight we procure great evil against our souls.\r\n\r\n26:20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the\r\nLORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied\r\nagainst this city and against this land according to all the words of\r\nJeremiah.\r\n\r\n26:21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all\r\nthe princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but\r\nwhen Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;\r\n26:22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the\r\nson of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.\r\n\r\n26:23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto\r\nJehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead\r\nbody into the graves of the common people.\r\n\r\n26:24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with\r\nJeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to\r\nput him to death.\r\n\r\n27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king\r\nof Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 27:2 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy\r\nneck, 27:3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,\r\nand to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the\r\nking of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem\r\nunto Zedekiah king of Judah; 27:4 And command them to say unto their\r\nmasters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall\r\nye say unto your masters; 27:5 I have made the earth, the man and the\r\nbeast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my\r\noutstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.\r\n\r\n27:6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of\r\nNebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the\r\nfield have I given him also to serve him.\r\n\r\n27:7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nuntil the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great\r\nkings shall serve themselves of him.\r\n\r\n27:8 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will\r\nnot serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will\r\nnot put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation\r\nwill I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine,\r\nand with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.\r\n\r\n27:9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,\r\nnor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers,\r\nwhich speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:\r\n27:10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your\r\nland; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.\r\n\r\n27:11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king\r\nof Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own\r\nland, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.\r\n\r\n27:12 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these\r\nwords, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,\r\nand serve him and his people, and live.\r\n\r\n27:13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the\r\nfamine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the\r\nnation that will not serve the king of Babylon?  27:14 Therefore\r\nhearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you,\r\nsaying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a\r\nlie unto you.\r\n\r\n27:15 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a\r\nlie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish,\r\nye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.\r\n\r\n27:16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that\r\nprophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nshall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a\r\nlie unto you.\r\n\r\n27:17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:\r\nwherefore should this city be laid waste?  27:18 But if they be\r\nprophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make\r\nintercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in\r\nthe house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at\r\nJerusalem, go not to Babylon.\r\n\r\n27:19 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and\r\nconcerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the\r\nresidue of the vessels that remain in this city.\r\n\r\n27:20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried\r\naway captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from\r\nJerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 27:21\r\nYea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the\r\nvessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the\r\nking of Judah and of Jerusalem; 27:22 They shall be carried to\r\nBabylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them,\r\nsaith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n28:1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign\r\nof Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month,\r\nthat Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake\r\nunto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and\r\nof all the people, saying, 28:2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the\r\nGod of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n28:3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the\r\nvessels of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took\r\naway from this place, and carried them to Babylon: 28:4 And I will\r\nbring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah,\r\nwith all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the\r\nLORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the\r\npresence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that\r\nstood in the house of the LORD, 28:6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said,\r\nAmen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast\r\nprophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, and all\r\nthat is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.\r\n\r\n28:7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears,\r\nand in the ears of all the people; 28:8 The prophets that have been\r\nbefore me and before thee of old prophesied both against many\r\ncountries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\n28:9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the\r\nprophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the\r\nLORD hath truly sent him.\r\n\r\n28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet\r\nJeremiah\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and brake it.\r\n\r\n28:11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,\r\nThus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar\r\nking of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two\r\nfull years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.\r\n\r\n28:12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after\r\nthat Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the\r\nprophet Jeremiah, saying, 28:13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus\r\nsaith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt\r\nmake for them yokes of iron.\r\n\r\n28:14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put\r\na yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve\r\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have\r\ngiven him the beasts of the field also.\r\n\r\n28:15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear\r\nnow, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this\r\npeople to trust in a lie.\r\n\r\n28:16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off\r\nthe face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast\r\ntaught rebellion against the LORD.\r\n\r\n28:17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.\r\n\r\n29:1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet\r\nsent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried\r\naway captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the\r\npeople whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to\r\nBabylon; 29:2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the\r\neunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and\r\nthe smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 29:3 By the hand of Elasah\r\nthe son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah\r\nking of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon)\r\nsaying, 29:4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all\r\nthat are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away\r\nfrom Jerusalem unto Babylon; 29:5 Build ye houses, and dwell in them;\r\nand plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 29:6 Take ye wives, and\r\nbeget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your\r\ndaughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye\r\nmay be increased there, and not diminished.\r\n\r\n29:7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be\r\ncarried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace\r\nthereof shall ye have peace.\r\n\r\n29:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your\r\nprophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you,\r\nneither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.\r\n\r\n29:9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent\r\nthem, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be\r\naccomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word\r\ntoward you, in causing you to return to this place.\r\n\r\n29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,\r\nthoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.\r\n\r\n29:12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,\r\nand I will hearken unto you.\r\n\r\n29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me\r\nwith all your heart.\r\n\r\n29:14 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away\r\nyour captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from\r\nall the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will\r\nbring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\n29:15 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in\r\nBabylon; 29:16 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth\r\nupon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this\r\ncity, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into\r\ncaptivity; 29:17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send\r\nupon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make\r\nthem like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.\r\n\r\n29:18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and\r\nwith the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the\r\nkingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an\r\nhissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven\r\nthem: 29:19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the\r\nLORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up\r\nearly and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n29:20 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,\r\nwhom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 29:21 Thus saith the LORD\r\nof hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of\r\nZedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my\r\nname; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king\r\nof Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 29:22 And of them\r\nshall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in\r\nBabylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom\r\nthe king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 29:23 Because they have\r\ncommitted villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their\r\nneighbours\xe2\x80\x99 wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I\r\nhave not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n29:24 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,\r\n29:25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,\r\nBecause thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that\r\nare at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and\r\nto all the priests, saying, 29:26 The LORD hath made thee priest in\r\nthe stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the\r\nhouse of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a\r\nprophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.\r\n\r\n29:27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,\r\nwhich maketh himself a prophet to you?  29:28 For therefore he sent\r\nunto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses,\r\nand dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.\r\n\r\n29:29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of\r\nJeremiah the prophet.\r\n\r\n29:30 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 29:31 Send\r\nto all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning\r\nShemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto\r\nyou, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 29:32\r\nTherefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the\r\nNehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this\r\npeople; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people,\r\nsaith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 30:2 Thus\r\nspeaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that\r\nI have spoken unto thee in a book.\r\n\r\n30:3 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again\r\nthe captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I\r\nwill cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers,\r\nand they shall possess it.\r\n\r\n30:4 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and\r\nconcerning Judah.\r\n\r\n30:5 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of\r\nfear, and not of peace.\r\n\r\n30:6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?\r\nwherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman\r\nin travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  30:7 Alas! for\r\nthat day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of\r\nJacob\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.\r\n\r\n30:8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,\r\nthat I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy\r\nbonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: 30:9 But\r\nthey shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will\r\nraise up unto them.\r\n\r\n30:10 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;\r\nneither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar,\r\nand thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return,\r\nand shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.\r\n\r\n30:11 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make\r\na full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will\r\nnot make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and\r\nwill not leave thee altogether unpunished.\r\n\r\n30:12 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound\r\nis grievous.\r\n\r\n30:13 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up:\r\nthou hast no healing medicines.\r\n\r\n30:14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I\r\nhave wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of\r\na cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins\r\nwere increased.\r\n\r\n30:15 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable\r\nfor the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased,\r\nI have done these things unto thee.\r\n\r\n30:16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all\r\nthine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and\r\nthey that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee\r\nwill I give for a prey.\r\n\r\n30:17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy\r\nwounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying,\r\nThis is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.\r\n\r\n30:18 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of\r\nJacob\xe2\x80\x99s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city\r\nshall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after\r\nthe manner thereof.\r\n\r\n30:19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them\r\nthat make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few;\r\nI will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.\r\n\r\n30:20 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their\r\ncongregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all\r\nthat oppress them.\r\n\r\n30:21 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor\r\nshall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw\r\nnear, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his\r\nheart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:22 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.\r\n\r\n30:23 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a\r\ncontinuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\n30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath\r\ndone it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the\r\nlatter days ye shall consider it.\r\n\r\n31:1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the\r\nfamilies of Israel, and they shall be my people.\r\n\r\n31:2 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword\r\nfound grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n31:3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved\r\nthee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I\r\ndrawn thee.\r\n\r\n31:4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of\r\nIsrael: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go\r\nforth in the dances of them that make merry.\r\n\r\n31:5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the\r\nplanters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.\r\n\r\n31:6 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount\r\nEphraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD\r\nour God.\r\n\r\n31:7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout\r\namong the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O\r\nLORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.\r\n\r\n31:8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them\r\nfrom the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame,\r\nthe woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a\r\ngreat company shall return thither.\r\n\r\n31:9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead\r\nthem: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight\r\nway, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and\r\nEphraim is my firstborn.\r\n\r\n31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the\r\nisles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and\r\nkeep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.\r\n\r\n31:11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand\r\nof him that was stronger than he.\r\n\r\n31:12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and\r\nshall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for\r\nwine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and\r\ntheir soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any\r\nmore at all.\r\n\r\n31:13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and\r\nold together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will\r\ncomfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.\r\n\r\n31:14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my\r\npeople shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:15 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,\r\nand bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be\r\ncomforted for her children, because they were not.\r\n\r\n31:16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine\r\neyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and\r\nthey shall come again from the land of the enemy.\r\n\r\n31:17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy\r\nchildren shall come again to their own border.\r\n\r\n31:18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast\r\nchastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the\r\nyoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n31:19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was\r\ninstructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even\r\nconfounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.\r\n\r\n31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I\r\nspake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my\r\nbowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n31:21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart\r\ntoward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O\r\nvirgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.\r\n\r\n31:22 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for\r\nthe LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass\r\na man.\r\n\r\n31:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they\r\nshall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof,\r\nwhen I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O\r\nhabitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.\r\n\r\n31:24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities\r\nthereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.\r\n\r\n31:25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every\r\nsorrowful soul.\r\n\r\n31:26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.\r\n\r\n31:27 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house\r\nof Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the\r\nseed of beast.\r\n\r\n31:28 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over\r\nthem, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to\r\ndestroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to\r\nplant, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a\r\nsour grape, and the children\xe2\x80\x99s teeth are set on edge.\r\n\r\n31:30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that\r\neateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.\r\n\r\n31:31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new\r\ncovenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 31:32\r\nNot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the\r\nday that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of\r\nEgypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto\r\nthem, saith the LORD: 31:33 But this shall be the covenant that I will\r\nmake with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I\r\nwill put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\r\nand will be their God, and they shall be my people.\r\n\r\n31:34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every\r\nman his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me,\r\nfrom the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for\r\nI will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.\r\n\r\n31:35 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,\r\nand the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,\r\nwhich divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts\r\nis his name: 31:36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith\r\nthe LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation\r\nbefore me for ever.\r\n\r\n31:37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the\r\nfoundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off\r\nall the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:38 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be\r\nbuilt to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n31:39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon\r\nthe hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.\r\n\r\n31:40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and\r\nall the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse\r\ngate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be\r\nplucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.\r\n\r\n32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of\r\nZedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of\r\nNebuchadrezzar.\r\n\r\n32:2 For then the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s army besieged Jerusalem: and\r\nJeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was\r\nin the king of Judah\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n32:3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore\r\ndost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give\r\nthis city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;\r\n32:4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of\r\nthe Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king\r\nof Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes\r\nshall behold his eyes; 32:5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and\r\nthere shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight\r\nwith the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.\r\n\r\n32:6 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\r\n32:7 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto\r\nthee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of\r\nredemption is thine to buy it.\r\n\r\n32:8 So Hanameel mine uncle\xe2\x80\x99s son came to me in the court of the\r\nprison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my\r\nfield, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of\r\nBenjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is\r\nthine; buy it for thyself.\r\n\r\nThen I knew that this was the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n32:9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s son, that was in\r\nAnathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.\r\n\r\n32:10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took\r\nwitnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.\r\n\r\n32:11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was\r\nsealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open: 32:12\r\nAnd I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,\r\nthe son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle\xe2\x80\x99s son, and in\r\nthe presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the\r\npurchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.\r\n\r\n32:13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 32:14 Thus saith the\r\nLORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence\r\nof the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is\r\nopen; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n32:15 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and\r\nfields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.\r\n\r\n32:16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto\r\nBaruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, 32:17 Ah\r\nLord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great\r\npower and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:\r\n32:18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the\r\niniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them:\r\nthe Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name, 32:19 Great\r\nin counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the\r\nways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and\r\naccording to the fruit of his doings: 32:20 Which hast set signs and\r\nwonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and\r\namong other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; 32:21 And\r\nhast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with\r\nsigns, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched\r\nout arm, and with great terror; 32:22 And hast given them this land,\r\nwhich thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing\r\nwith milk and honey; 32:23 And they came in, and possessed it; but\r\nthey obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done\r\nnothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast\r\ncaused all this evil to come upon them: 32:24 Behold the mounts, they\r\nare come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand\r\nof the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of\r\nthe famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come\r\nto pass; and, behold, thou seest it.\r\n\r\n32:25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for\r\nmoney, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the\r\nChaldeans.\r\n\r\n32:26 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 32:27\r\nBehold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too\r\nhard for me?  32:28 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give\r\nthis city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: 32:29 And the\r\nChaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on\r\nthis city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have\r\noffered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other\r\ngods, to provoke me to anger.\r\n\r\n32:30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only\r\ndone evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have\r\nonly provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n32:31 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and\r\nof my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I\r\nshould remove it from before my face, 32:32 Because of all the evil of\r\nthe children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have\r\ndone to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their\r\npriests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants\r\nof Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n32:33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though\r\nI taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not\r\nhearkened to receive instruction.\r\n\r\n32:34 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by\r\nmy name, to defile it.\r\n\r\n32:35 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley\r\nof the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass\r\nthrough the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came\r\nit into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah\r\nto sin.\r\n\r\n32:36 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,\r\nconcerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the\r\nhand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by\r\nthe pestilence; 32:37 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries,\r\nwhither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great\r\nwrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause\r\nthem to dwell safely: 32:38 And they shall be my people, and I will be\r\ntheir God: 32:39 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that\r\nthey may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children\r\nafter them: 32:40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them,\r\nthat I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put\r\nmy fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.\r\n\r\n32:41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant\r\nthem in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n32:42 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great\r\nevil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I\r\nhave promised them.\r\n\r\n32:43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is\r\ndesolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the\r\nChaldeans.\r\n\r\n32:44 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and\r\nseal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the\r\nplaces about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities\r\nof the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities\r\nof the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n33:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,\r\nwhile he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, 33:2 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to\r\nestablish it; the LORD is his name; 33:3 Call unto me, and I will\r\nanswer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n33:4 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses\r\nof this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which\r\nare thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 33:5 They come to\r\nfight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies\r\nof men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all\r\nwhose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.\r\n\r\n33:6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,\r\nand will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.\r\n\r\n33:7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of\r\nIsrael to return, and will build them, as at the first.\r\n\r\n33:8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they\r\nhave sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,\r\nwhereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against\r\nme.\r\n\r\n33:9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour\r\nbefore all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good\r\nthat I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the\r\ngoodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.\r\n\r\n33:10 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,\r\nwhich ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in\r\nthe cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are\r\ndesolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,\r\n33:11 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the\r\nbridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall\r\nsay, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy\r\nendureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of\r\npraise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the\r\ncaptivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n33:12 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is\r\ndesolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof,\r\nshall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.\r\n\r\n33:13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and\r\nin the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the\r\nplaces about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks\r\npass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n33:14 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that\r\ngood thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the\r\nhouse of Judah.\r\n\r\n33:15 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of\r\nrighteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and\r\nrighteousness in the land.\r\n\r\n33:16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell\r\nsafely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD\r\nour righteousness.\r\n\r\n33:17 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit\r\nupon the throne of the house of Israel; 33:18 Neither shall the\r\npriests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and\r\nto kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.\r\n\r\n33:19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 33:20 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my\r\ncovenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in\r\ntheir season; 33:21 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my\r\nservant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and\r\nwith the Levites the priests, my ministers.\r\n\r\n33:22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of\r\nthe sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and\r\nthe Levites that minister unto me.\r\n\r\n33:23 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 33:24\r\nConsiderest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two\r\nfamilies which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus\r\nthey have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n33:25 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,\r\nand if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 33:26\r\nThen will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that\r\nI will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham,\r\nIsaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have\r\nmercy on them.\r\n\r\n34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when\r\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms\r\nof the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against\r\nJerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying, 34:2 Thus saith\r\nthe LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah,\r\nand tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into\r\nthe hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: 34:3\r\nAnd thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken,\r\nand delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of\r\nthe king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and\r\nthou shalt go to Babylon.\r\n\r\n34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus\r\nsaith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 34:5 But thou\r\nshalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former\r\nkings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and\r\nthey will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the\r\nword, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah\r\nking of Judah in Jerusalem, 34:7 When the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s army\r\nfought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that\r\nwere left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced\r\ncities remained of the cities of Judah.\r\n\r\n34:8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after\r\nthat the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which\r\nwere at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 34:9 That every man\r\nshould let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an\r\nHebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of\r\nthem, to wit, of a Jew his brother.\r\n\r\n34:10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered\r\ninto the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and\r\nevery one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves\r\nof them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.\r\n\r\n34:11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the\r\nhandmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into\r\nsubjection for servants and for handmaids.\r\n\r\n34:12 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,\r\nsaying, 34:13 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a\r\ncovenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of\r\nthe land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, 34:14 At the\r\nend of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which\r\nhath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou\r\nshalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto\r\nme, neither inclined their ear.\r\n\r\n34:15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in\r\nproclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a\r\ncovenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 34:16 But\r\nye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and\r\nevery man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure,\r\nto return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for\r\nservants and for handmaids.\r\n\r\n34:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in\r\nproclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his\r\nneighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to\r\nthe sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you\r\nto be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.\r\n\r\n34:18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,\r\nwhich have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made\r\nbefore me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the\r\nparts thereof, 34:19 The princes of Judah, and the princes of\r\nJerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the\r\nland, which passed between the parts of the calf; 34:20 I will even\r\ngive them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them\r\nthat seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the\r\nfowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n34:21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the\r\nhand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life,\r\nand into the hand of the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s army, which are gone up\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\n34:22 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return\r\nto this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn\r\nit with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without\r\nan inhabitant.\r\n\r\n35:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of\r\nJehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 35:2 Go unto the\r\nhouse of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the\r\nhouse of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n35:3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,\r\nand his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the\r\nRechabites; 35:4 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into\r\nthe chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God,\r\nwhich was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber\r\nof Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 35:5 And I set\r\nbefore the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and\r\ncups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.\r\n\r\n35:6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of\r\nRechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,\r\nneither ye, nor your sons for ever: 35:7 Neither shall ye build house,\r\nnor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye\r\nshall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye\r\nbe strangers.\r\n\r\n35:8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our\r\nfather in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days,\r\nwe, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 35:9 Nor to build houses\r\nfor us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:\r\n35:10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according\r\nto all that Jonadab our father commanded us.\r\n\r\n35:11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up\r\ninto the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear\r\nof the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians:\r\nso we dwell at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n35:12 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 35:13 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of\r\nJudah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive\r\ninstruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n35:14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his\r\nsons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink\r\nnone, but obey their father\xe2\x80\x99s commandment: notwithstanding I have\r\nspoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto\r\nme.\r\n\r\n35:15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising\r\nup early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his\r\nevil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve\r\nthem, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to\r\nyour fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto\r\nme.\r\n\r\n35:16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the\r\ncommandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people\r\nhath not hearkened unto me: 35:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of\r\nhosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all\r\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced\r\nagainst them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not\r\nheard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.\r\n\r\n35:18 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith\r\nthe LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the\r\ncommandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and\r\ndone according unto all that he hath commanded you: 35:19 Therefore\r\nthus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of\r\nRechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.\r\n\r\n36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of\r\nJosiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,\r\nsaying, 36:2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the\r\nwords that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah,\r\nand against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the\r\ndays of Josiah, even unto this day.\r\n\r\n36:3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I\r\npurpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil\r\nway; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.\r\n\r\n36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote\r\nfrom the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had\r\nspoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.\r\n\r\n36:5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go\r\ninto the house of the LORD: 36:6 Therefore go thou, and read in the\r\nroll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in\r\nthe ears of the people in the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house upon the fasting day: and\r\nalso thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of\r\ntheir cities.\r\n\r\n36:7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,\r\nand will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger\r\nand the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.\r\n\r\n36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah\r\nthe prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD\r\nin the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n36:9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of\r\nJosiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast\r\nbefore the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people\r\nthat came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n36:10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house\r\nof the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe,\r\nin the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nin the ears of all the people.\r\n\r\n36:11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard\r\nout of the book all the words of the LORD, 36:12 Then he went down\r\ninto the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, into the scribe\xe2\x80\x99s chamber: and, lo, all the\r\nprinces sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of\r\nShemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of\r\nShaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.\r\n\r\n36:13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had\r\nheard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.\r\n\r\n36:14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the\r\nson of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine\r\nhand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and\r\ncome. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came\r\nunto them.\r\n\r\n36:15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.\r\nSo Baruch read it in their ears.\r\n\r\n36:16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they\r\nwere afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely\r\ntell the king of all these words.\r\n\r\n36:17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write\r\nall these words at his mouth?  36:18 Then Baruch answered them, He\r\npronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them\r\nwith ink in the book.\r\n\r\n36:19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and\r\nJeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.\r\n\r\n36:20 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up\r\nthe roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words\r\nin the ears of the king.\r\n\r\n36:21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of\r\nElishama the scribe\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the\r\nking, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.\r\n\r\n36:22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and\r\nthere was a fire on the hearth burning before him.\r\n\r\n36:23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four\r\nleaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that\r\nwas on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that\r\nwas on the hearth.\r\n\r\n36:24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the\r\nking, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.\r\n\r\n36:25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made\r\nintercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would\r\nnot hear them.\r\n\r\n36:26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and\r\nSeraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take\r\nBaruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.\r\n\r\n36:27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king\r\nhad burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of\r\nJeremiah, saying, 36:28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it\r\nall the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the\r\nking of Judah hath burned.\r\n\r\n36:29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the\r\nLORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written\r\ntherein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy\r\nthis land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?  36:30\r\nTherefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall\r\nhave none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be\r\ncast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.\r\n\r\n36:31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their\r\niniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have\r\npronounced against them; but they hearkened not.\r\n\r\n36:32 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the\r\nscribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of\r\nJeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had\r\nburned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n37:1 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the\r\nson of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the\r\nland of Judah.\r\n\r\n37:2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did\r\nhearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet\r\nJeremiah.\r\n\r\n37:3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and\r\nZephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah,\r\nsaying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.\r\n\r\n37:4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had\r\nnot put him into prison.\r\n\r\n37:5 Then Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the\r\nChaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed\r\nfrom Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n37:6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,\r\n37:7 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the\r\nking of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold,\r\nPharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt\r\ninto their own land.\r\n\r\n37:8 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city,\r\nand take it, and burn it with fire.\r\n\r\n37:9 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The\r\nChaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.\r\n\r\n37:10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that\r\nfight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet\r\nshould they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n37:11 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was\r\nbroken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s army, 37:12 Then\r\nJeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin,\r\nto separate himself thence in the midst of the people.\r\n\r\n37:13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward\r\nwas there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of\r\nHananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away\r\nto the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\n37:14 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the\r\nChaldeans.\r\n\r\nBut he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him\r\nto the princes.\r\n\r\n37:15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,\r\nand put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they\r\nhad made that the prison.\r\n\r\n37:16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,\r\nand Jeremiah had remained there many days; 37:17 Then Zedekiah the\r\nking sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his\r\nhouse, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said,\r\nThere is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the\r\nking of Babylon.\r\n\r\n37:18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended\r\nagainst thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye\r\nhave put me in prison?  37:19 Where are now your prophets which\r\nprophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come\r\nagainst you, nor against this land?  37:20 Therefore hear now, I pray\r\nthee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be\r\naccepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of\r\nJonathan the scribe, lest I die there.\r\n\r\n37:21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit\r\nJeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him\r\ndaily a piece of bread out of the bakers\xe2\x80\x99 street, until all the bread\r\nin the city were spent.\r\n\r\nThus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.\r\n\r\n38:1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of\r\nPashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of\r\nMalchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the\r\npeople, saying, 38:2 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this\r\ncity shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but\r\nhe that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his\r\nlife for a prey, and shall live.\r\n\r\n38:3 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the\r\nhand of the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s army, which shall take it.\r\n\r\n38:4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let\r\nthis man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men\r\nof war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in\r\nspeaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of\r\nthis people, but the hurt.\r\n\r\n38:5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the\r\nking is not he that can do any thing against you.\r\n\r\n38:6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of\r\nMalchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison:\r\nand they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no\r\nwater, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.\r\n\r\n38:7 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was\r\nin the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon;\r\nthe king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 38:8 Ebedmelech went\r\nforth out of the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and spake to the king saying, 38:9 My\r\nlord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to\r\nJeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is\r\nlike to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more\r\nbread in the city.\r\n\r\n38:10 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take\r\nfrom hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out\r\nof the dungeon, before he die.\r\n\r\n38:11 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of\r\nthe king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old\r\nrotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.\r\n\r\n38:12 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these\r\nold cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords.\r\nAnd Jeremiah did so.\r\n\r\n38:13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the\r\ndungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.\r\n\r\n38:14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto\r\nhim into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the\r\nking said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from\r\nme.\r\n\r\n38:15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,\r\nwilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt\r\nthou not hearken unto me?  38:16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly\r\nunto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I\r\nwill not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of\r\nthese men that seek thy life.\r\n\r\n38:17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God\r\nof hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the\r\nking of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city\r\nshall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:\r\n38:18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s princes,\r\nthen shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they\r\nshall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.\r\n\r\n38:19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the\r\nJews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their\r\nhand, and they mock me.\r\n\r\n38:20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech\r\nthee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be\r\nwell unto thee, and thy soul shall live.\r\n\r\n38:21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD\r\nhath shewed me: 38:22 And, behold, all the women that are left in the\r\nking of Judah\xe2\x80\x99s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprinces, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and\r\nhave prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they\r\nare turned away back.\r\n\r\n38:23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the\r\nChaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be\r\ntaken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this\r\ncity to be burned with fire.\r\n\r\n38:24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these\r\nwords, and thou shalt not die.\r\n\r\n38:25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they\r\ncome unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast\r\nsaid unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to\r\ndeath; also what the king said unto thee: 38:26 Then thou shalt say\r\nunto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would\r\nnot cause me to return to Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s house, to die there.\r\n\r\n38:27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he\r\ntold them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So\r\nthey left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.\r\n\r\n38:28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that\r\nJerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.\r\n\r\n39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,\r\ncame Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against\r\nJerusalem, and they besieged it.\r\n\r\n39:2 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the\r\nninth day of the month, the city was broken up.\r\n\r\n39:3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in\r\nthe middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris,\r\nNergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the\r\nking of Babylon.\r\n\r\n39:4 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw\r\nthem, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of\r\nthe city by night, by the way of the king\xe2\x80\x99s garden, by the gate\r\nbetwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.\r\n\r\n39:5 But the Chaldeans\xe2\x80\x99 army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah\r\nin the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought\r\nhim up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of\r\nHamath, where he gave judgment upon him.\r\n\r\n39:6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah\r\nbefore his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n39:7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and bound him with chains,\r\nto carry him to Babylon.\r\n\r\n39:8 And the Chaldeans burned the king\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the houses of the\r\npeople, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n39:9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive\r\ninto Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and\r\nthose that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people\r\nthat remained.\r\n\r\n39:10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the\r\npeople, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them\r\nvineyards and fields at the same time.\r\n\r\n39:11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning\r\nJeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, 39:12 Take\r\nhim, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as\r\nhe shall say unto thee.\r\n\r\n39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,\r\nRabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprinces; 39:14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of\r\nthe prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son\r\nof Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n39:15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut\r\nup in the court of the prison, saying, 39:16 Go and speak to\r\nEbedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the\r\nGod of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil,\r\nand not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n39:17 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou\r\nshalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.\r\n\r\n39:18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the\r\nsword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast\r\nput thy trust in me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that\r\nNebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when\r\nhe had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried\r\naway captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive\r\nunto Babylon.\r\n\r\n40:2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,\r\nThe LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.\r\n\r\n40:3 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:\r\nbecause ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his\r\nvoice, therefore this thing is come upon you.\r\n\r\n40:4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were\r\nupon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into\r\nBabylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto\r\nthee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is\r\nbefore thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,\r\nthither go.\r\n\r\n40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to\r\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of\r\nBabylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with\r\nhim among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto\r\nthee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a\r\nreward, and let him go.\r\n\r\n40:6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and\r\ndwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.\r\n\r\n40:7 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields,\r\neven they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made\r\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed\r\nunto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of\r\nthem that were not carried away captive to Babylon; 40:8 Then they\r\ncame to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and\r\nJohanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of\r\nTanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the\r\nson of a Maachathite, they and their men.\r\n\r\n40:9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them\r\nand to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in\r\nthe land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n40:10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the\r\nChaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer\r\nfruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your\r\ncities that ye have taken.\r\n\r\n40:11 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the\r\nAmmonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that\r\nthe king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set\r\nover them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 40:12 Even\r\nall the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and\r\ncame to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine\r\nand summer fruits very much.\r\n\r\n40:13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the\r\nforces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 40:14 And\r\nsaid unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the\r\nAmmonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But\r\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.\r\n\r\n40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah\r\nsecretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the\r\nson of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay\r\nthee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be\r\nscattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?  40:16 But Gedaliah the\r\nson of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do\r\nthis thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.\r\n\r\n41:1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of\r\nNethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of\r\nthe king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam\r\nto Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.\r\n\r\n41:2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that\r\nwere with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan\r\nwith the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made\r\ngovernor over the land.\r\n\r\n41:3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with\r\nGedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the\r\nmen of war.\r\n\r\n41:4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah,\r\nand no man knew it, 41:5 That there came certain from Shechem, from\r\nShiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards\r\nshaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with\r\nofferings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n41:6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet\r\nthem, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met\r\nthem, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.\r\n\r\n41:7 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that\r\nIshmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst\r\nof the pit, he, and the men that were with him.\r\n\r\n41:8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us\r\nnot: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and\r\nof oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n41:9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the\r\nmen, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king\r\nhad made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of\r\nNethaniah filled it with them that were slain.\r\n\r\n41:10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people\r\nthat were in Mizpah, even the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, and all the people\r\nthat remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had\r\ncommitted to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of\r\nNethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the\r\nAmmonites.\r\n\r\n41:11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the\r\nforces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son\r\nof Nethaniah had done, 41:12 Then they took all the men, and went to\r\nfight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great\r\nwaters that are in Gibeon.\r\n\r\n41:13 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with\r\nIshmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the\r\nforces that were with him, then they were glad.\r\n\r\n41:14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from\r\nMizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of\r\nKareah.\r\n\r\n41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight\r\nmen, and went to the Ammonites.\r\n\r\n41:16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the\r\nforces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had\r\nrecovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that\r\nhe had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and\r\nthe women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought\r\nagain from Gibeon: 41:17 And they departed, and dwelt in the\r\nhabitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into\r\nEgypt, 41:18 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,\r\nbecause Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of\r\nAhikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.\r\n\r\n42:1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of\r\nKareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the\r\nleast even unto the greatest, came near, 42:2 And said unto Jeremiah\r\nthe prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before\r\nthee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this\r\nremnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold\r\nus:) 42:3 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may\r\nwalk, and the thing that we may do.\r\n\r\n42:4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;\r\nbehold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words;\r\nand it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer\r\nyou, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.\r\n\r\n42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful\r\nwitness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the\r\nwhich the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.\r\n\r\n42:6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice\r\nof the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with\r\nus, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n42:7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD\r\ncame unto Jeremiah.\r\n\r\n42:8 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of\r\nthe forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even\r\nto the greatest, 42:9 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God\r\nof Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before\r\nhim; 42:10 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,\r\nand not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for\r\nI repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.\r\n\r\n42:11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be\r\nnot afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and\r\nto deliver you from his hand.\r\n\r\n42:12 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon\r\nyou, and cause you to return to your own land.\r\n\r\n42:13 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the\r\nvoice of the LORD your God, 42:14 Saying, No; but we will go into the\r\nland of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the\r\ntrumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: 42:15 And\r\nnow therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your\r\nfaces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 42:16 Then it\r\nshall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake\r\nyou there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were\r\nafraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye\r\nshall die.\r\n\r\n42:17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into\r\nEgypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine,\r\nand by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from\r\nthe evil that I will bring upon them.\r\n\r\n42:18 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine\r\nanger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall\r\nenter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment,\r\nand a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.\r\n\r\n42:19 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye\r\nnot into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.\r\n\r\n42:20 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD\r\nyour God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according\r\nunto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we\r\nwill do it.\r\n\r\n42:21 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not\r\nobeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he\r\nhath sent me unto you.\r\n\r\n42:22 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by\r\nthe famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to\r\ngo and to sojourn.\r\n\r\n43:1 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of\r\nspeaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for\r\nwhich the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,\r\n43:2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of\r\nKareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest\r\nfalsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt\r\nto sojourn there: 43:3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on\r\nagainst us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that\r\nthey might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.\r\n\r\n43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,\r\nand all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the\r\nland of Judah.\r\n\r\n43:5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the\r\nforces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all\r\nnations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;\r\n43:6 Even men, and women, and children, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, and\r\nevery person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with\r\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the\r\nprophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.\r\n\r\n43:7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the\r\nvoice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.\r\n\r\n43:8 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,\r\nsaying, 43:9 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the\r\nclay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s house in\r\nTahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 43:10 And say unto them,\r\nThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send\r\nand take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set\r\nhis throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his\r\nroyal pavilion over them.\r\n\r\n43:11 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and\r\ndeliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity\r\nto captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.\r\n\r\n43:12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and\r\nhe shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array\r\nhimself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment;\r\nand he shall go forth from thence in peace.\r\n\r\n43:13 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the\r\nland of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he\r\nburn with fire.\r\n\r\n44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which\r\ndwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes,\r\nand at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 44:2 Thus saith\r\nthe LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I\r\nhave brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and,\r\nbehold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,\r\n44:3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke\r\nme to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other\r\ngods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.\r\n\r\n44:4 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising\r\nearly and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that\r\nI hate.\r\n\r\n44:5 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their\r\nwickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.\r\n\r\n44:6 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was\r\nkindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and\r\nthey are wasted and desolate, as at this day.\r\n\r\n44:7 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of\r\nIsrael; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut\r\noff from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave\r\nyou none to remain; 44:8 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the\r\nworks of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of\r\nEgypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off,\r\nand that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of\r\nthe earth?  44:9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and\r\nthe wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their\r\nwives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives,\r\nwhich they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of\r\nJerusalem?  44:10 They are not humbled even unto this day, neither\r\nhave they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set\r\nbefore you and before your fathers.\r\n\r\n44:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;\r\nBehold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n44:12 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces\r\nto go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be\r\nconsumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed\r\nby the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even\r\nunto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be\r\nan execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.\r\n\r\n44:13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I\r\nhave punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the\r\npestilence: 44:14 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone\r\ninto the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that\r\nthey should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a\r\ndesire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as\r\nshall escape.\r\n\r\n44:15 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense\r\nunto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude,\r\neven all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros,\r\nanswered Jeremiah, saying, 44:16 As for the word that thou hast spoken\r\nunto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.\r\n\r\n44:17 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our\r\nown mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out\r\ndrink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our\r\nkings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of\r\nJerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw\r\nno evil.\r\n\r\n44:18 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,\r\nand to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things,\r\nand have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.\r\n\r\n44:19 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured\r\nout drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her,\r\nand pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?  44:20 Then\r\nJeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and\r\nto all the people which had given him that answer, saying, 44:21 The\r\nincense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of\r\nJerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the\r\npeople of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not\r\ninto his mind?  44:22 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because\r\nof the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye\r\nhave committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an\r\nastonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.\r\n\r\n44:23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned\r\nagainst the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor\r\nwalked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies;\r\ntherefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.\r\n\r\n44:24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the\r\nwomen, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of\r\nEgypt: 44:25 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying;\r\nYe and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled\r\nwith your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have\r\nvowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink\r\nofferings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely\r\nperform your vows.\r\n\r\n44:26 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in\r\nthe land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the\r\nLORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of\r\nJudah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.\r\n\r\n44:27 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and\r\nall the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed\r\nby the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.\r\n\r\n44:28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the\r\nland of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah,\r\nthat are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know\r\nwhose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.\r\n\r\n44:29 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will\r\npunish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely\r\nstand against you for evil: 44:30 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will\r\ngive Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and\r\ninto the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of\r\nJudah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and\r\nthat sought his life.\r\n\r\n45:1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of\r\nNeriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of\r\nJeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of\r\nJudah, saying, 45:2 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee,\r\nO Baruch: 45:3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added\r\ngrief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.\r\n\r\n45:4 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that\r\nwhich I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I\r\nwill pluck up, even this whole land.\r\n\r\n45:5 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,\r\nbehold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life\r\nwill I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.\r\n\r\n46:1 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against\r\nthe Gentiles; 46:2 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho\r\nking of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim\r\nthe son of Josiah king of Judah.\r\n\r\n46:3 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.\r\n\r\n46:4 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with\r\nyour helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.\r\n\r\n46:5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and\r\ntheir mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not\r\nback: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n46:6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they\r\nshall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.\r\n\r\n46:7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as\r\nthe rivers?  46:8 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are\r\nmoved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the\r\nearth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\n46:9 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men\r\ncome forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield;\r\nand the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.\r\n\r\n46:10 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of\r\nvengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword\r\nshall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood:\r\nfor the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the\r\nriver Euphrates.\r\n\r\n46:11 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of\r\nEgypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\n46:12 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the\r\nland: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they\r\nare fallen both together.\r\n\r\n46:13 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n46:14 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph\r\nand in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword\r\nshall devour round about thee.\r\n\r\n46:15 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the\r\nLORD did drive them.\r\n\r\n46:16 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said,\r\nArise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our\r\nnativity, from the oppressing sword.\r\n\r\n46:17 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he\r\nhath passed the time appointed.\r\n\r\n46:18 As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,\r\nSurely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so\r\nshall he come.\r\n\r\n46:19 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into\r\ncaptivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.\r\n\r\n46:20 Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it\r\ncometh out of the north.\r\n\r\n46:21 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks;\r\nfor they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did\r\nnot stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and\r\nthe time of their visitation.\r\n\r\n46:22 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march\r\nwith an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.\r\n\r\n46:23 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot\r\nbe searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are\r\ninnumerable.\r\n\r\n46:24 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be\r\ndelivered into the hand of the people of the north.\r\n\r\n46:25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will\r\npunish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods,\r\nand their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him: 46:26\r\nAnd I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives,\r\nand into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand\r\nof his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days\r\nof old, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n46:27 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O\r\nIsrael: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from\r\nthe land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest\r\nand at ease, and none shall make him afraid.\r\n\r\n46:28 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with\r\nthee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have\r\ndriven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee\r\nin measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.\r\n\r\n47:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against\r\nthe Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.\r\n\r\n47:2 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and\r\nshall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all\r\nthat is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men\r\nshall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.\r\n\r\n47:3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses,\r\nat the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the\r\nfathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;\r\n47:4 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and\r\nto cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the\r\nLORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of\r\nCaphtor.\r\n\r\n47:5 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant\r\nof their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?  47:6 O thou sword of\r\nthe LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into\r\nthy scabbard, rest, and be still.\r\n\r\n47:7 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge\r\nagainst Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n48:1 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe\r\nunto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken:\r\nMisgab is confounded and dismayed.\r\n\r\n48:2 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have\r\ndevised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a\r\nnation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n48:3 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n48:4 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.\r\n\r\n48:5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for\r\nin the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n48:6 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n48:7 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,\r\nthou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity\r\nwith his priests and his princes together.\r\n\r\n48:8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall\r\nescape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be\r\ndestroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.\r\n\r\n48:9 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the\r\ncities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.\r\n\r\n48:10 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and\r\ncursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.\r\n\r\n48:11 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on\r\nhis lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither\r\nhath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and\r\nhis scent is not changed.\r\n\r\n48:12 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will\r\nsend unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall\r\nempty his vessels, and break their bottles.\r\n\r\n48:13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was\r\nashamed of Bethel their confidence.\r\n\r\n48:14 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?  48:15\r\nMoab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young\r\nmen are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the\r\nLORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n48:16 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n48:17 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his\r\nname, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!\r\n48:18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory,\r\nand sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and\r\nhe shall destroy thy strong holds.\r\n\r\n48:19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that\r\nfleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?  48:20 Moab is\r\nconfounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon,\r\nthat Moab is spoiled, 48:21 And judgment is come upon the plain\r\ncountry; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, 48:22 And\r\nupon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, 48:23 And upon\r\nKiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, 48:24 And upon\r\nKerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab,\r\nfar or near.\r\n\r\n48:25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n48:26 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD:\r\nMoab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.\r\n\r\n48:27 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among\r\nthieves?  for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.\r\n\r\n48:28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the\r\nrock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the\r\nhole\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\r\n\r\n48:29 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his\r\nloftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n48:30 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his\r\nlies shall not so effect it.\r\n\r\n48:31 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;\r\nmine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.\r\n\r\n48:32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of\r\nJazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of\r\nJazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy\r\nvintage.\r\n\r\n48:33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from\r\nthe land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses:\r\nnone shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.\r\n\r\n48:34 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,\r\nhave they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an\r\nheifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\n48:35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that\r\noffereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.\r\n\r\n48:36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine\r\nheart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the\r\nriches that he hath gotten are perished.\r\n\r\n48:37 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all\r\nthe hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.\r\n\r\n48:38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of\r\nMoab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel\r\nwherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n48:39 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab\r\nturned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a\r\ndismaying to all them about him.\r\n\r\n48:40 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and\r\nshall spread his wings over Moab.\r\n\r\n48:41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the\r\nmighty men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a\r\nwoman in her pangs.\r\n\r\n48:42 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath\r\nmagnified himself against the LORD.\r\n\r\n48:43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O\r\ninhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n48:44 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he\r\nthat getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will\r\nbring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n48:45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the\r\nforce: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from\r\nthe midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown\r\nof the head of the tumultuous ones.\r\n\r\n48:46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for\r\nthy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.\r\n\r\n48:47 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,\r\nsaith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.\r\n\r\n49:1 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no\r\nsons?  hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his\r\npeople dwell in his cities?  49:2 Therefore, behold, the days come,\r\nsaith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in\r\nRabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her\r\ndaughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto\r\nthem that were his heirs, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n49:3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,\r\ngird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for\r\ntheir king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n49:4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O\r\nbacksliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall\r\ncome unto me?  49:5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the\r\nLord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be\r\ndriven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that\r\nwandereth.\r\n\r\n49:6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of\r\nAmmon, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n49:7 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more\r\nin Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom\r\nvanished?  49:8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of\r\nDedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I\r\nwill visit him.\r\n\r\n49:9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some\r\ngleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n49:10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,\r\nand he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his\r\nbrethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.\r\n\r\n49:11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and\r\nlet thy widows trust in me.\r\n\r\n49:12 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to\r\ndrink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall\r\naltogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt\r\nsurely drink of it.\r\n\r\n49:13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall\r\nbecome a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the\r\ncities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.\r\n\r\n49:14 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent\r\nunto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her,\r\nand rise up to the battle.\r\n\r\n49:15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised\r\namong men.\r\n\r\n49:16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine\r\nheart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest\r\nthe height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as\r\nthe eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n49:17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it\r\nshall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.\r\n\r\n49:18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour\r\ncities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither\r\nshall a son of man dwell in it.\r\n\r\n49:19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan\r\nagainst the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run\r\naway from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?\r\nfor who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that\r\nshepherd that will stand before me?  49:20 Therefore hear the counsel\r\nof the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that\r\nhe hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of\r\nthe flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations\r\ndesolate with them.\r\n\r\n49:21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the\r\nnoise thereof was heard in the Red sea.\r\n\r\n49:22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his\r\nwings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men\r\nof Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.\r\n\r\n49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they\r\nhave heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the\r\nsea; it cannot be quiet.\r\n\r\n49:24 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear\r\nhath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in\r\ntravail.\r\n\r\n49:25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!  49:26\r\nTherefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of\r\nwar shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n49:27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall\r\nconsume the palaces of Benhadad.\r\n\r\n49:28 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise\r\nye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.\r\n\r\n49:29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall\r\ntake to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their\r\ncamels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.\r\n\r\n49:30 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,\r\nsaith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel\r\nagainst you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.\r\n\r\n49:31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without\r\ncare, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n49:32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their\r\ncattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the\r\nutmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides\r\nthereof, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n49:33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for\r\never: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.\r\n\r\n49:34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against\r\nElam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,\r\n49:35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of\r\nElam, the chief of their might.\r\n\r\n49:36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters\r\nof heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there\r\nshall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.\r\n\r\n49:37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and\r\nbefore them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them,\r\neven my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after\r\nthem, till I have consumed them: 49:38 And I will set my throne in\r\nElam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n49:39 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring\r\nagain the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n50:1 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land\r\nof the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.\r\n\r\n50:2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;\r\npublish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded,\r\nMerodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are\r\nbroken in pieces.\r\n\r\n50:3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which\r\nshall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall\r\nremove, they shall depart, both man and beast.\r\n\r\n50:4 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of\r\nIsrael shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and\r\nweeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.\r\n\r\n50:5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,\r\nsaying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual\r\ncovenant that shall not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n50:6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them\r\nto go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have\r\ngone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.\r\n\r\n50:7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries\r\nsaid, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the\r\nhabitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.\r\n\r\n50:8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land\r\nof the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.\r\n\r\n50:9 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an\r\nassembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set\r\nthemselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their\r\narrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.\r\n\r\n50:10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be\r\nsatisfied, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n50:11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of\r\nmine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and\r\nbellow as bulls; 50:12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that\r\nbare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall\r\nbe a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.\r\n\r\n50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but\r\nit shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be\r\nastonished, and hiss at all her plagues.\r\n\r\n50:14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that\r\nbend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned\r\nagainst the LORD.\r\n\r\n50:15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her\r\nfoundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the\r\nvengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do\r\nunto her.\r\n\r\n50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle\r\nin the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall\r\nturn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own\r\nland.\r\n\r\n50:17 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:\r\nfirst the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.\r\n\r\n50:18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;\r\nBehold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have\r\npunished the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n50:19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall\r\nfeed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount\r\nEphraim and Gilead.\r\n\r\n50:20 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of\r\nIsrael shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of\r\nJudah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n50:21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and\r\nagainst the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after\r\nthem, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n50:22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.\r\n\r\n50:23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how\r\nis Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  50:24 I have laid a\r\nsnare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not\r\naware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven\r\nagainst the LORD.\r\n\r\n50:25 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the\r\nweapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of\r\nhosts in the land of the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\n50:26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:\r\ncast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n50:27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe\r\nunto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.\r\n\r\n50:28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of\r\nBabylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the\r\nvengeance of his temple.\r\n\r\n50:29 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the\r\nbow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense\r\nher according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do\r\nunto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy\r\nOne of Israel.\r\n\r\n50:30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her\r\nmen of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n50:31 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD\r\nof hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.\r\n\r\n50:32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise\r\nhim up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour\r\nall round about him.\r\n\r\n50:33 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the\r\nchildren of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them\r\ncaptives held them fast; they refused to let them go.\r\n\r\n50:34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he\r\nshall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land,\r\nand disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.\r\n\r\n50:35 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the\r\ninhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.\r\n\r\n50:36 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon\r\nher mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.\r\n\r\n50:37 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon\r\nall the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall\r\nbecome as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be\r\nrobbed.\r\n\r\n50:38 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it\r\nis the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.\r\n\r\n50:39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of\r\nthe islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and\r\nit shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in\r\nfrom generation to generation.\r\n\r\n50:40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities\r\nthereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall\r\nany son of man dwell therein.\r\n\r\n50:41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation,\r\nand many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.\r\n\r\n50:42 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will\r\nnot shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall\r\nride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle,\r\nagainst thee, O daughter of Babylon.\r\n\r\n50:43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands\r\nwaxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in\r\ntravail.\r\n\r\n50:44 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan\r\nunto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run\r\naway from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?\r\nfor who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that\r\nshepherd that will stand before me?  50:45 Therefore hear ye the\r\ncounsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his\r\npurposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans:\r\nSurely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall\r\nmake their habitation desolate with them.\r\n\r\n50:46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and\r\nthe cry is heard among the nations.\r\n\r\n51:1 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and\r\nagainst them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me,\r\na destroying wind; 51:2 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall\r\nfan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they\r\nshall be against her round about.\r\n\r\n51:3 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against\r\nhim that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her\r\nyoung men; destroy ye utterly all her host.\r\n\r\n51:4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they\r\nthat are thrust through in her streets.\r\n\r\n51:5 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the\r\nLORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy\r\nOne of Israel.\r\n\r\n51:6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul:\r\nbe not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.\r\n\r\n51:7 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s hand, that made all\r\nthe earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the\r\nnations are mad.\r\n\r\n51:8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm\r\nfor her pain, if so be she may be healed.\r\n\r\n51:9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her,\r\nand let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment\r\nreacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.\r\n\r\n51:10 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us\r\ndeclare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.\r\n\r\n51:11 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised\r\nup the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against\r\nBabylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the\r\nvengeance of his temple.\r\n\r\n51:12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch\r\nstrong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath\r\nboth devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\n51:13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures,\r\nthine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.\r\n\r\n51:14 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will\r\nfill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a\r\nshout against thee.\r\n\r\n51:15 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the\r\nworld by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n51:16 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in\r\nthe heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the\r\nearth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out\r\nof his treasures.\r\n\r\n51:17 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is\r\nconfounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and\r\nthere is no breath in them.\r\n\r\n51:18 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their\r\nvisitation they shall perish.\r\n\r\n51:19 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of\r\nall things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of\r\nhosts is his name.\r\n\r\n51:20 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I\r\nbreak in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;\r\n51:21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;\r\nand with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 51:22\r\nWith thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee\r\nwill I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in\r\npieces the young man and the maid; 51:23 I will also break in pieces\r\nwith thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in\r\npieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break\r\nin pieces captains and rulers.\r\n\r\n51:24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of\r\nChaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n51:25 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the\r\nLORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand\r\nupon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a\r\nburnt mountain.\r\n\r\n51:26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a\r\nstone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n51:27 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the\r\nnations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her\r\nthe kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain\r\nagainst her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.\r\n\r\n51:28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the\r\ncaptains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\n51:29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the\r\nLORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a\r\ndesolation without an inhabitant.\r\n\r\n51:30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have\r\nremained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as\r\nwomen: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.\r\n\r\n51:31 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet\r\nanother, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one\r\nend, 51:32 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have\r\nburned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.\r\n\r\n51:33 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The\r\ndaughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh\r\nher: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.\r\n\r\n51:34 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath\r\ncrushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up\r\nlike a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath\r\ncast me out.\r\n\r\n51:35 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall\r\nthe inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of\r\nChaldea, shall Jerusalem say.\r\n\r\n51:36 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause,\r\nand take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her\r\nsprings dry.\r\n\r\n51:37 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an\r\nastonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.\r\n\r\n51:38 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhelps.\r\n\r\n51:39 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them\r\ndrunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not\r\nwake, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n51:40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams\r\nwith he goats.\r\n\r\n51:41 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth\r\nsurprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!\r\n51:42 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the\r\nmultitude of the waves thereof.\r\n\r\n51:43 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a\r\nland wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\n51:44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of\r\nhis mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not\r\nflow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.\r\n\r\n51:45 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every\r\nman his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.\r\n\r\n51:46 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall\r\nbe heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after\r\nthat in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land,\r\nruler against ruler.\r\n\r\n51:47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon\r\nthe graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded,\r\nand all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.\r\n\r\n51:48 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall\r\nsing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n51:49 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at\r\nBabylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.\r\n\r\n51:50 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:\r\nremember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.\r\n\r\n51:51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath\r\ncovered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the\r\nLORD\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n51:52 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do\r\njudgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded\r\nshall groan.\r\n\r\n51:53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should\r\nfortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come\r\nunto her, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n51:54 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from\r\nthe land of the Chaldeans: 51:55 Because the LORD hath spoiled\r\nBabylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do\r\nroar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: 51:56\r\nBecause the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her\r\nmighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD\r\nGod of recompences shall surely requite.\r\n\r\n51:57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her\r\ncaptains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a\r\nperpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD\r\nof hosts.\r\n\r\n51:58 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall\r\nbe utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and\r\nthe people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they\r\nshall be weary.\r\n\r\n51:59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of\r\nNeriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of\r\nJudah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah\r\nwas a quiet prince.\r\n\r\n51:60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon\r\nBabylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.\r\n\r\n51:61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and\r\nshalt see, and shalt read all these words; 51:62 Then shalt thou say,\r\nO LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none\r\nshall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be\r\ndesolate for ever.\r\n\r\n51:63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this\r\nbook, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst\r\nof Euphrates: 51:64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and\r\nshall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they\r\nshall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.\r\n\r\n52:1 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and\r\nhe reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nHamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.\r\n\r\n52:2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according\r\nto all that Jehoiakim had done.\r\n\r\n52:3 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem\r\nand Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah\r\nrebelled against the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n52:4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth\r\nmonth, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of\r\nBabylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched\r\nagainst it, and built forts against it round about.\r\n\r\n52:5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.\r\n\r\n52:6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the\r\nfamine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\n52:7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and\r\nwent forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the\r\ntwo walls, which was by the king\xe2\x80\x99s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by\r\nthe city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.\r\n\r\n52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and\r\novertook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was\r\nscattered from him.\r\n\r\n52:9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of\r\nBabylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n52:10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his\r\neyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.\r\n\r\n52:11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon\r\nbound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison\r\ntill the day of his death.\r\n\r\n52:12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was\r\nthe nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came\r\nNebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon,\r\ninto Jerusalem, 52:13 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the\r\ngreat men, burned he with fire: 52:14 And all the army of the\r\nChaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the\r\nwalls of Jerusalem round about.\r\n\r\n52:15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive\r\ncertain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that\r\nremained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king\r\nof Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.\r\n\r\n52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the\r\npoor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.\r\n\r\n52:17 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,\r\nand the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD,\r\nthe Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.\r\n\r\n52:18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the\r\nbowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they\r\nministered, took they away.\r\n\r\n52:19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the\r\ncaldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that\r\nwhich was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver,\r\ntook the captain of the guard away.\r\n\r\n52:20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were\r\nunder the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:\r\nthe brass of all these vessels was without weight.\r\n\r\n52:21 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was\r\neighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the\r\nthickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.\r\n\r\n52:22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one\r\nchapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the\r\nchapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the\r\npomegranates were like unto these.\r\n\r\n52:23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all\r\nthe pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.\r\n\r\n52:24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and\r\nZephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 52:25\r\nHe took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the\r\nmen of war; and seven men of them that were near the king\xe2\x80\x99s person,\r\nwhich were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host,\r\nwho mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people\r\nof the land, that were found in the midst of the city.\r\n\r\n52:26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought\r\nthem to the king of Babylon to Riblah.\r\n\r\n52:27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in\r\nRiblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out\r\nof his own land.\r\n\r\n52:28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in\r\nthe seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 52:29 In\r\nthe eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from\r\nJerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 52:30 In the three and\r\ntwentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard\r\ncarried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons:\r\nall the persons were four thousand and six hundred.\r\n\r\n52:31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the\r\ncaptivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the\r\nfive and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon\r\nin the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king\r\nof Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.\r\n\r\n52:32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne\r\nof the kings that were with him in Babylon, 52:33 And changed his\r\nprison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the\r\ndays of his life.\r\n\r\n52:34 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the\r\nking of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all\r\nthe days of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamentations of Jeremiah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is\r\nshe become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and\r\nprincess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!  1:2 She\r\nweepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all\r\nher lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt\r\ntreacherously with her, they are become her enemies.\r\n\r\n1:3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of\r\ngreat servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest:\r\nall her persecutors overtook her between the straits.\r\n\r\n1:4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:\r\nall her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are\r\nafflicted, and she is in bitterness.\r\n\r\n1:5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD\r\nhath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her\r\nchildren are gone into captivity before the enemy.\r\n\r\n1:6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her\r\nprinces are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone\r\nwithout strength before the pursuer.\r\n\r\n1:7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her\r\nmiseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when\r\nher people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the\r\nadversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.\r\n\r\n1:8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all\r\nthat honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:\r\nyea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.\r\n\r\n1:9 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;\r\ntherefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD,\r\nbehold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.\r\n\r\n1:10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant\r\nthings: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary,\r\nwhom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n1:11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their\r\npleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and\r\nconsider; for I am become vile.\r\n\r\n1:12 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if\r\nthere be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,\r\nwherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.\r\n\r\n1:13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth\r\nagainst them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me\r\nback: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.\r\n\r\n1:14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are\r\nwreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall,\r\nthe LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able\r\nto rise up.\r\n\r\n1:15 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst\r\nof me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men:\r\nthe LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a\r\nwinepress.\r\n\r\n1:16 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with\r\nwater, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from\r\nme: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.\r\n\r\n1:17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her:\r\nthe LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should\r\nbe round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.\r\n\r\n1:18 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his\r\ncommandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my\r\nvirgins and my young men are gone into captivity.\r\n\r\n1:19 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine\r\nelders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to\r\nrelieve their souls.\r\n\r\n1:20 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;\r\nmine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad\r\nthe sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.\r\n\r\n1:21 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all\r\nmine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast\r\ndone it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall\r\nbe like unto me.\r\n\r\n1:22 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as\r\nthou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are\r\nmany, and my heart is faint.\r\n\r\n2:1 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his\r\nanger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,\r\nand remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!  2:2 The\r\nLORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not\r\npitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the\r\ndaughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath\r\npolluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.\r\n\r\n2:3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he\r\nhath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned\r\nagainst Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.\r\n\r\n2:4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand\r\nas an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the\r\ntabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.\r\n\r\n2:5 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath\r\nswallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and\r\nhath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.\r\n\r\n2:6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of\r\na garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath\r\ncaused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and\r\nhath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.\r\n\r\n2:7 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,\r\nhe hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;\r\nthey have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a\r\nsolemn feast.\r\n\r\n2:8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of\r\nZion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand\r\nfrom destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;\r\nthey languished together.\r\n\r\n2:9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken\r\nher bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is\r\nno more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep\r\nsilence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded\r\nthemselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their\r\nheads to the ground.\r\n\r\n2:11 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is\r\npoured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my\r\npeople; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n2:12 They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they\r\nswooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was\r\npoured out into their mothers\xe2\x80\x99 bosom.\r\n\r\n2:13 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I\r\nliken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee,\r\nthat I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is\r\ngreat like the sea: who can heal thee?  2:14 Thy prophets have seen\r\nvain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine\r\niniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false\r\nburdens and causes of banishment.\r\n\r\n2:15 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag\r\ntheir head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that\r\nmen call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?  2:16\r\nAll thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and\r\ngnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is\r\nthe day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.\r\n\r\n2:17 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled\r\nhis word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown\r\ndown, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice\r\nover thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.\r\n\r\n2:18 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion,\r\nlet tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest;\r\nlet not the apple of thine eye cease.\r\n\r\n2:19 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour\r\nout thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy\r\nhands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for\r\nhunger in the top of every street.\r\n\r\n2:20 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall\r\nthe women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the\r\npriest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?  2:21\r\nThe young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and\r\nmy young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day\r\nof thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.\r\n\r\n2:22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so\r\nthat in the day of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s anger none escaped nor remained: those\r\nthat I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.\r\n\r\n3:1 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.\r\n\r\n3:2 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.\r\n\r\n3:3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n3:4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.\r\n\r\n3:5 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and\r\ntravail.\r\n\r\n3:6 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.\r\n\r\n3:7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my\r\nchain heavy.\r\n\r\n3:8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.\r\n\r\n3:9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths\r\ncrooked.\r\n\r\n3:10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n3:11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath\r\nmade me desolate.\r\n\r\n3:12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.\r\n\r\n3:13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.\r\n\r\n3:14 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.\r\n\r\n3:15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with\r\nwormwood.\r\n\r\n3:16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered\r\nme with ashes.\r\n\r\n3:17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n3:18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:\r\n3:19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the\r\ngall.\r\n\r\n3:20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.\r\n\r\n3:21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.\r\n\r\n3:22 It is of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s mercies that we are not consumed, because his\r\ncompassions fail not.\r\n\r\n3:23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.\r\n\r\n3:24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3:25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that\r\nseeketh him.\r\n\r\n3:26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the\r\nsalvation of the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.\r\n\r\n3:28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n3:29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.\r\n\r\n3:30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full\r\nwith reproach.\r\n\r\n3:31 For the LORD will not cast off for ever: 3:32 But though he cause\r\ngrief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his\r\nmercies.\r\n\r\n3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.\r\n\r\n3:34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.\r\n\r\n3:35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most\r\nHigh, 3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.\r\n\r\n3:37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord\r\ncommandeth it not?  3:38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth\r\nnot evil and good?  3:39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man\r\nfor the punishment of his sins?  3:40 Let us search and try our ways,\r\nand turn again to the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.\r\n\r\n3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.\r\n\r\n3:43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,\r\nthou hast not pitied.\r\n\r\n3:44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should\r\nnot pass through.\r\n\r\n3:45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.\r\n\r\n3:47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.\r\n\r\n3:48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of\r\nthe daughter of my people.\r\n\r\n3:49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any\r\nintermission.\r\n\r\n3:50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.\r\n\r\n3:51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n3:52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.\r\n\r\n3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n3:54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.\r\n\r\n3:55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.\r\n\r\n3:56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at\r\nmy cry.\r\n\r\n3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou\r\nsaidst, Fear not.\r\n\r\n3:58 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast\r\nredeemed my life.\r\n\r\n3:59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.\r\n\r\n3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n3:61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their\r\nimaginations against me; 3:62 The lips of those that rose up against\r\nme, and their device against me all the day.\r\n\r\n3:63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their\r\nmusick.\r\n\r\n3:64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n3:65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.\r\n\r\n3:66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n4:1 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the\r\nstones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.\r\n\r\n4:2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they\r\nesteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!\r\n4:3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their\r\nyoung ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the\r\nostriches in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n4:4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth\r\nfor thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4:5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they\r\nthat were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.\r\n\r\n4:6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is\r\ngreater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown\r\nas in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.\r\n\r\n4:7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,\r\nthey were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of\r\nsapphire: 4:8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known\r\nin the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it\r\nis become like a stick.\r\n\r\n4:9 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be\r\nslain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of\r\nthe fruits of the field.\r\n\r\n4:10 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:\r\nthey were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.\r\n\r\n4:11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his\r\nfierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured\r\nthe foundations thereof.\r\n\r\n4:12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,\r\nwould not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have\r\nentered into the gates of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n4:13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,\r\nthat have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, 4:14 They\r\nhave wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted\r\nthemselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.\r\n\r\n4:15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,\r\ntouch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the\r\nheathen, They shall no more sojourn there.\r\n\r\n4:16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard\r\nthem: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not\r\nthe elders.\r\n\r\n4:17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our\r\nwatching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.\r\n\r\n4:18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is\r\nnear, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.\r\n\r\n4:19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they\r\npursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken\r\nin their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among\r\nthe heathen.\r\n\r\n4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the\r\nland of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be\r\ndrunken, and shalt make thyself naked.\r\n\r\n4:22 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of\r\nZion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit\r\nthine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.\r\n\r\n5:1 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n5:2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.\r\n\r\n5:3 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.\r\n\r\n5:4 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.\r\n\r\n5:5 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.\r\n\r\n5:6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to\r\nbe satisfied with bread.\r\n\r\n5:7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their\r\niniquities.\r\n\r\n5:8 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us\r\nout of their hand.\r\n\r\n5:9 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword\r\nof the wilderness.\r\n\r\n5:10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.\r\n\r\n5:11 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of\r\nJudah.\r\n\r\n5:12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not\r\nhonoured.\r\n\r\n5:13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n5:14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their\r\nmusick.\r\n\r\n5:15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n5:16 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have\r\nsinned!  5:17 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes\r\nare dim.\r\n\r\n5:18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes\r\nwalk upon it.\r\n\r\n5:19 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n5:20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long\r\ntime?  5:21 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned;\r\nrenew our days as of old.\r\n\r\n5:22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of the Prophet Ezekiel\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,\r\nin the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river\r\nof Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.\r\n\r\n1:2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king\r\nJehoiachin\xe2\x80\x99s captivity, 1:3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto\r\nEzekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by\r\nthe river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.\r\n\r\n1:4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a\r\ngreat cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about\r\nit, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the\r\nmidst of the fire.\r\n\r\n1:5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living\r\ncreatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a\r\nman.\r\n\r\n1:6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.\r\n\r\n1:7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was\r\nlike the sole of a calf\xe2\x80\x99s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of\r\nburnished brass.\r\n\r\n1:8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four\r\nsides; and they four had their faces and their wings.\r\n\r\n1:9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they\r\nwent; they went every one straight forward.\r\n\r\n1:10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a\r\nman, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the\r\nface of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an\r\neagle.\r\n\r\n1:11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two\r\nwings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n1:12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was\r\nto go, they went; and they turned not when they went.\r\n\r\n1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was\r\nlike burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went\r\nup and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and\r\nout of the fire went forth lightning.\r\n\r\n1:14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a\r\nflash of lightning.\r\n\r\n1:15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the\r\nearth by the living creatures, with his four faces.\r\n\r\n1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the\r\ncolour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their\r\nappearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n1:17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned\r\nnot when they went.\r\n\r\n1:18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;\r\nand their rings were full of eyes round about them four.\r\n\r\n1:19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and\r\nwhen the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels\r\nwere lifted up.\r\n\r\n1:20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their\r\nspirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the\r\nspirit of the living creature was in the wheels.\r\n\r\n1:21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;\r\nand when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted\r\nup over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\n1:22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living\r\ncreature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth\r\nover their heads above.\r\n\r\n1:23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward\r\nthe other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every\r\none had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.\r\n\r\n1:24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the\r\nnoise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of\r\nspeech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n1:25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their\r\nheads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.\r\n\r\n1:26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the\r\nlikeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon\r\nthe likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man\r\nabove upon it.\r\n\r\n1:27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round\r\nabout within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and\r\nfrom the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the\r\nappearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.\r\n\r\n1:28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of\r\nrain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was\r\nthe appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I\r\nsaw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.\r\n\r\n2:1 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will\r\nspeak unto thee.\r\n\r\n2:2 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me\r\nupon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.\r\n\r\n2:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of\r\nIsrael, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and\r\ntheir fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.\r\n\r\n2:4 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee\r\nunto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n2:5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,\r\n(for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been\r\na prophet among them.\r\n\r\n2:6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of\r\ntheir words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost\r\ndwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed\r\nat their looks, though they be a rebellious house.\r\n\r\n2:7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear,\r\nor whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.\r\n\r\n2:8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou\r\nrebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I\r\ngive thee.\r\n\r\n2:9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a\r\nroll of a book was therein; 2:10 And he spread it before me; and it\r\nwas written within and without: and there was written therein\r\nlamentations, and mourning, and woe.\r\n\r\n3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat\r\nthis roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.\r\n\r\n3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill\r\nthy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it\r\nwas in my mouth as honey for sweetness.\r\n\r\n3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of\r\nIsrael, and speak with my words unto them.\r\n\r\n3:5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an\r\nhard language, but to the house of Israel; 3:6 Not to many people of a\r\nstrange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not\r\nunderstand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened\r\nunto thee.\r\n\r\n3:7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will\r\nnot hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and\r\nhardhearted.\r\n\r\n3:8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy\r\nforehead strong against their foreheads.\r\n\r\n3:9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear\r\nthem not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a\r\nrebellious house.\r\n\r\n3:10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall\r\nspeak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.\r\n\r\n3:11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of\r\nthy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord\r\nGOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.\r\n\r\n3:12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a\r\ngreat rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n3:13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that\r\ntouched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them,\r\nand a noise of a great rushing.\r\n\r\n3:14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in\r\nbitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was\r\nstrong upon me.\r\n\r\n3:15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by\r\nthe river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there\r\nastonished among them seven days.\r\n\r\n3:16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of\r\nthe LORD came unto me, saying, 3:17 Son of man, I have made thee a\r\nwatchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my\r\nmouth, and give them warning from me.\r\n\r\n3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou\r\ngivest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his\r\nwicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his\r\niniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.\r\n\r\n3:19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,\r\nnor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast\r\ndelivered thy soul.\r\n\r\n3:20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and\r\ncommit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die:\r\nbecause thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and\r\nhis righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his\r\nblood will I require at thine hand.\r\n\r\n3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous\r\nsin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is\r\nwarned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.\r\n\r\n3:22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me,\r\nArise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.\r\n\r\n3:23 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the\r\nglory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river\r\nof Chebar: and I fell on my face.\r\n\r\n3:24 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and\r\nspake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.\r\n\r\n3:25 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee,\r\nand shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:\r\n3:26 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that\r\nthou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are\r\na rebellious house.\r\n\r\n3:27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt\r\nsay unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear;\r\nand he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n4:1 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee,\r\nand pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: 4:2 And lay siege\r\nagainst it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it;\r\nset the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n4:3 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of\r\niron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it\r\nshall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be\r\na sign to the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n4:4 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the\r\nhouse of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou\r\nshalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.\r\n\r\n4:5 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according\r\nto the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt\r\nthou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n4:6 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side,\r\nand thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I\r\nhave appointed thee each day for a year.\r\n\r\n4:7 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,\r\nand thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.\r\n\r\n4:8 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn\r\nthee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\n4:9 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and\r\nlentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and\r\nmake thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou\r\nshalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n4:10 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty\r\nshekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.\r\n\r\n4:11 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin:\r\nfrom time to time shalt thou drink.\r\n\r\n4:12 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it\r\nwith dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.\r\n\r\n4:13 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat\r\ntheir defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.\r\n\r\n4:14 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted:\r\nfor from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which\r\ndieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable\r\nflesh into my mouth.\r\n\r\n4:15 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow\xe2\x80\x99s dung for man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.\r\n\r\n4:16 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the\r\nstaff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and\r\nwith care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with\r\nastonishment: 4:17 That they may want bread and water, and be astonied\r\none with another, and consume away for their iniquity.\r\n\r\n5:1 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy\r\nbeard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.\r\n\r\n5:2 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city,\r\nwhen the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third\r\npart, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt\r\nscatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.\r\n\r\n5:3 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\n5:4 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire,\r\nand burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into\r\nall the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the\r\nmidst of the nations and countries that are round about her.\r\n\r\n5:6 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the\r\nnations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about\r\nher: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not\r\nwalked in them.\r\n\r\n5:7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than\r\nthe nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my\r\nstatutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according\r\nto the judgments of the nations that are round about you; 5:8\r\nTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee,\r\nand will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n5:9 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I\r\nwill not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.\r\n\r\n5:10 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,\r\nand the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in\r\nthee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.\r\n\r\n5:11 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou\r\nhast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all\r\nthine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall\r\nmine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.\r\n\r\n5:12 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with\r\nfamine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part\r\nshall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third\r\npart into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.\r\n\r\n5:13 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury\r\nto rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I\r\nthe LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n5:14 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations\r\nthat are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.\r\n\r\n5:15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an\r\nastonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall\r\nexecute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.\r\nI the LORD have spoken it.\r\n\r\n5:16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which\r\nshall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you:\r\nand I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of\r\nbread: 5:17 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they\r\nshall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee;\r\nand I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.\r\n\r\n6:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:2 Son of man, set\r\nthy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,\r\n6:3 And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD;\r\nThus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the\r\nrivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon\r\nyou, and I will destroy your high places.\r\n\r\n6:4 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be\r\nbroken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.\r\n\r\n6:5 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before\r\ntheir idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.\r\n\r\n6:6 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the\r\nhigh places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and\r\nmade desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images\r\nmay be cut down, and your works may be abolished.\r\n\r\n6:7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know\r\nthat I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:8 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall\r\nescape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through\r\nthe countries.\r\n\r\n6:9 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations\r\nwhither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their\r\nwhorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which\r\ngo a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for\r\nthe evils which they have committed in all their abominations.\r\n\r\n6:10 And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said\r\nin vain that I would do this evil unto them.\r\n\r\n6:11 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with\r\nthy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of\r\nIsrael! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\n6:12 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is\r\nnear shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged\r\nshall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.\r\n\r\n6:13 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall\r\nbe among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill,\r\nin all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and\r\nunder every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to\r\nall their idols.\r\n\r\n6:14 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land\r\ndesolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in\r\nall their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 7:2 Also, thou\r\nson of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end,\r\nthe end is come upon the four corners of the land.\r\n\r\n7:3 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon\r\nthee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense\r\nupon thee all thine abominations.\r\n\r\n7:4 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I\r\nwill recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in\r\nthe midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.\r\n\r\n7:6 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it\r\nis come.\r\n\r\n7:7 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:\r\nthe time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding\r\nagain of the mountains.\r\n\r\n7:8 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine\r\nanger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will\r\nrecompense thee for all thine abominations.\r\n\r\n7:9 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will\r\nrecompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are\r\nin the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that\r\nsmiteth.\r\n\r\n7:10 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;\r\nthe rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.\r\n\r\n7:11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall\r\nremain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall\r\nthere be wailing for them.\r\n\r\n7:12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer\r\nrejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n7:13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although\r\nthey were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude\r\nthereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself\r\nin the iniquity of his life.\r\n\r\n7:14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none\r\ngoeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.\r\n\r\n7:15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within:\r\nhe that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in\r\nthe city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.\r\n\r\n7:16 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the\r\nmountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one\r\nfor his iniquity.\r\n\r\n7:17 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.\r\n\r\n7:18 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall\r\ncover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\n7:19 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall\r\nbe removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver\r\nthem in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their\r\nsouls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of\r\ntheir iniquity.\r\n\r\n7:20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they\r\nmade the images of their abominations and of their detestable things\r\ntherein: therefore have I set it far from them.\r\n\r\n7:21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,\r\nand to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.\r\n\r\n7:22 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my\r\nsecret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.\r\n\r\n7:23 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city\r\nis full of violence.\r\n\r\n7:24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall\r\npossess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to\r\ncease; and their holy places shall be defiled.\r\n\r\n7:25 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n7:26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon\r\nrumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law\r\nshall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.\r\n\r\n7:27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with\r\ndesolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled:\r\nI will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts\r\nwill I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the\r\nfifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of\r\nJudah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.\r\n\r\n8:2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from\r\nthe appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins\r\neven upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.\r\n\r\n8:3 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of\r\nmine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the\r\nheaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door\r\nof the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of\r\nthe image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.\r\n\r\n8:4 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according\r\nto the vision that I saw in the plain.\r\n\r\n8:5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way\r\ntoward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north,\r\nand behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy\r\nin the entry.\r\n\r\n8:6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?\r\neven the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here,\r\nthat I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again,\r\nand thou shalt see greater abominations.\r\n\r\n8:7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,\r\nbehold a hole in the wall.\r\n\r\n8:8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I\r\nhad digged in the wall, behold a door.\r\n\r\n8:9 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations\r\nthat they do here.\r\n\r\n8:10 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,\r\nand abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel,\r\npourtrayed upon the wall round about.\r\n\r\n8:11 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the\r\nhouse of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of\r\nShaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of\r\nincense went up.\r\n\r\n8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the\r\nancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the\r\nchambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD\r\nhath forsaken the earth.\r\n\r\n8:13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see\r\ngreater abominations that they do.\r\n\r\n8:14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nwhich was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for\r\nTammuz.\r\n\r\n8:15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn\r\nthee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.\r\n\r\n8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, and,\r\nbehold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and\r\nthe altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the\r\ntemple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they\r\nworshipped the sun toward the east.\r\n\r\n8:17 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a\r\nlight thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations\r\nwhich they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence,\r\nand have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch\r\nto their nose.\r\n\r\n8:18 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,\r\nneither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud\r\nvoice, yet will I not hear them.\r\n\r\n9:1 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them\r\nthat have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his\r\ndestroying weapon in his hand.\r\n\r\n9:2 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which\r\nlieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand;\r\nand one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer\xe2\x80\x99s inkhorn\r\nby his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.\r\n\r\n9:3 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,\r\nwhereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the\r\nman clothed with linen, which had the writer\xe2\x80\x99s inkhorn by his side;\r\n9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,\r\nthrough the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of\r\nthe men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done\r\nin the midst thereof.\r\n\r\n9:5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through\r\nthe city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 9:6\r\nSlay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and\r\nwomen: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at\r\nmy sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n9:7 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with\r\nthe slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.\r\n\r\n9:8 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,\r\nthat I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou\r\ndestroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon\r\nJerusalem?  9:9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of\r\nIsrael and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood,\r\nand the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath\r\nforsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.\r\n\r\n9:10 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have\r\npity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.\r\n\r\n9:11 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by\r\nhis side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast\r\ncommanded me.\r\n\r\n10:1 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the\r\nhead of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire\r\nstone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.\r\n\r\n10:2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in\r\nbetween the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with\r\ncoals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the\r\ncity. And he went in in my sight.\r\n\r\n10:3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the\r\nman went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.\r\n\r\n10:4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood\r\nover the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the\r\ncloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s glory.\r\n\r\n10:5 And the sound of the cherubims\xe2\x80\x99 wings was heard even to the outer\r\ncourt, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.\r\n\r\n10:6 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed\r\nwith linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between\r\nthe cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.\r\n\r\n10:7 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the\r\ncherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took\r\nthereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen:\r\nwho took it, and went out.\r\n\r\n10:8 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nunder their wings.\r\n\r\n10:9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one\r\nwheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the\r\nappearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.\r\n\r\n10:10 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if\r\na wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.\r\n\r\n10:11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not\r\nas they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed\r\nit; they turned not as they went.\r\n\r\n10:12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and\r\ntheir wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the\r\nwheels that they four had.\r\n\r\n10:13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n10:14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a\r\ncherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the\r\nface of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.\r\n\r\n10:15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature\r\nthat I saw by the river of Chebar.\r\n\r\n10:16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when\r\nthe cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the\r\nsame wheels also turned not from beside them.\r\n\r\n10:17 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,\r\nthese lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature\r\nwas in them.\r\n\r\n10:18 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of\r\nthe house, and stood over the cherubims.\r\n\r\n10:19 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the\r\nearth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside\r\nthem, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.\r\n\r\n10:20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel\r\nby the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.\r\n\r\n10:21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and\r\nthe likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.\r\n\r\n10:22 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw\r\nby the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went\r\nevery one straight forward.\r\n\r\n11:1 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east\r\ngate of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the\r\ndoor of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the\r\nson of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.\r\n\r\n11:2 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise\r\nmischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 11:3 Which say, It is\r\nnot near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n11:4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.\r\n\r\n11:5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;\r\nThus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know\r\nthe things that come into your mind, every one of them.\r\n\r\n11:6 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled\r\nthe streets thereof with the slain.\r\n\r\n11:7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid\r\nin the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron:\r\nbut I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.\r\n\r\n11:8 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,\r\nsaith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n11:9 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you\r\ninto the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.\r\n\r\n11:10 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of\r\nIsrael; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:11 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the\r\nflesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of\r\nIsrael: 11:12 And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not\r\nwalked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done\r\nafter the manners of the heathen that are round about you.\r\n\r\n11:13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of\r\nBenaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud\r\nvoice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant\r\nof Israel?  11:14 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\r\n11:15 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy\r\nkindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us\r\nis this land given in possession.\r\n\r\n11:16 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast\r\nthem far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them\r\namong the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in\r\nthe countries where they shall come.\r\n\r\n11:17 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you\r\nfrom the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have\r\nbeen scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.\r\n\r\n11:18 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the\r\ndetestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n11:19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit\r\nwithin you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and\r\nwill give them an heart of flesh: 11:20 That they may walk in my\r\nstatutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my\r\npeople, and I will be their God.\r\n\r\n11:21 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their\r\ndetestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way\r\nupon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n11:22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels\r\nbeside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.\r\n\r\n11:23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,\r\nand stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.\r\n\r\n11:24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by\r\nthe Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the\r\nvision that I had seen went up from me.\r\n\r\n11:25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the\r\nLORD had shewed me.\r\n\r\n12:1 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 12:2 Son of man,\r\nthou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to\r\nsee, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a\r\nrebellious house.\r\n\r\n12:3 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and\r\nremove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to\r\nanother place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though\r\nthey be a rebellious house.\r\n\r\n12:4 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as\r\nstuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as\r\nthey that go forth into captivity.\r\n\r\n12:5 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.\r\n\r\n12:6 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry\r\nit forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not\r\nthe ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n12:7 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day,\r\nas stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with\r\nmine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my\r\nshoulder in their sight.\r\n\r\n12:8 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,\r\n12:9 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,\r\nsaid unto thee, What doest thou?  12:10 Say thou unto them, Thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all\r\nthe house of Israel that are among them.\r\n\r\n12:11 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done\r\nunto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.\r\n\r\n12:12 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder\r\nin the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall\r\nto carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the\r\nground with his eyes.\r\n\r\n12:13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my\r\nsnare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans;\r\nyet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.\r\n\r\n12:14 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to\r\nhelp him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.\r\n\r\n12:15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter\r\nthem among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.\r\n\r\n12:16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the\r\nfamine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their\r\nabominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know\r\nthat I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:17 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 12:18 Son of\r\nman, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling\r\nand with carefulness; 12:19 And say unto the people of the land, Thus\r\nsaith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of\r\nIsrael; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their\r\nwater with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that\r\nis therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.\r\n\r\n12:20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the\r\nland shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n12:21 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 12:22 Son of man,\r\nwhat is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The\r\ndays are prolonged, and every vision faileth?  12:23 Tell them\r\ntherefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease,\r\nand they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto\r\nthem, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.\r\n\r\n12:24 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering\r\ndivination within the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n12:25 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak\r\nshall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O\r\nrebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the\r\nLord GOD.\r\n\r\n12:26 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.\r\n\r\n12:27 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision\r\nthat he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the\r\ntimes that are far off.\r\n\r\n12:28 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall\r\nnone of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have\r\nspoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n13:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:2 Son of man,\r\nprophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou\r\nunto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of\r\nthe LORD; 13:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets,\r\nthat follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!  13:4 O Israel,\r\nthy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.\r\n\r\n13:5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for\r\nthe house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:6 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD\r\nsaith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to\r\nhope that they would confirm the word.\r\n\r\n13:7 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying\r\ndivination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not\r\nspoken?  13:8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have\r\nspoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,\r\nsaith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n13:9 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and\r\nthat divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people,\r\nneither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel,\r\nneither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know\r\nthat I am the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n13:10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,\r\nPeace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo,\r\nothers daubed it with untempered morter: 13:11 Say unto them which\r\ndaub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an\r\noverflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a\r\nstormy wind shall rend it.\r\n\r\n13:12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,\r\nWhere is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?  13:13 Therefore\r\nthus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my\r\nfury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and\r\ngreat hailstones in my fury to consume it.\r\n\r\n13:14 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with\r\nuntempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the\r\nfoundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye\r\nshall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n13:15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them\r\nthat have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The\r\nwall is no more, neither they that daubed it; 13:16 To wit, the\r\nprophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see\r\nvisions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n13:17 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of\r\nthy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou\r\nagainst them, 13:18 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women\r\nthat sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of\r\nevery stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and\r\nwill ye save the souls alive that come unto you?  13:19 And will ye\r\npollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of\r\nbread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls\r\nalive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your\r\nlies?  13:20 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against\r\nyour pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and\r\nI will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the\r\nsouls that ye hunt to make them fly.\r\n\r\n13:21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of\r\nyour hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye\r\nshall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n13:22 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,\r\nwhom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked,\r\nthat he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:\r\n13:23 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:\r\nfor I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that\r\nI am the LORD.\r\n\r\n14:1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before\r\nme.\r\n\r\n14:2 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 14:3 Son of man,\r\nthese men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the\r\nstumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be\r\nenquired of at all by them?  14:4 Therefore speak unto them, and say\r\nunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel\r\nthat setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock\r\nof his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD\r\nwill answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;\r\n14:5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because\r\nthey are all estranged from me through their idols.\r\n\r\n14:6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nRepent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces\r\nfrom all your abominations.\r\n\r\n14:7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that\r\nsojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up\r\nhis idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity\r\nbefore his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning\r\nme; I the LORD will answer him by myself: 14:8 And I will set my face\r\nagainst that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will\r\ncut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n14:9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the\r\nLORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon\r\nhim, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.\r\n\r\n14:10 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the\r\npunishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that\r\nseeketh unto him; 14:11 That the house of Israel may go no more astray\r\nfrom me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;\r\nbut that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n14:12 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 14:13 Son of man,\r\nwhen the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will\r\nI stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread\r\nthereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast\r\nfrom it: 14:14 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in\r\nit, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness,\r\nsaith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n14:15 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they\r\nspoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because\r\nof the beasts: 14:16 Though these three men were in it, as I live,\r\nsaith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters;\r\nthey only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.\r\n\r\n14:17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through\r\nthe land; so that I cut off man and beast from it: 14:18 Though these\r\nthree men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall\r\ndeliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n14:19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury\r\nupon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 14:20 Though Noah,\r\nDaniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall\r\ndeliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own\r\nsouls by their righteousness.\r\n\r\n14:21 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four\r\nsore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the\r\nnoisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?\r\n14:22 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be\r\nbrought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth\r\nunto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be\r\ncomforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even\r\nconcerning all that I have brought upon it.\r\n\r\n14:23 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their\r\ndoings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that\r\nI have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n15:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 15:2 Son of man,\r\nwhat is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is\r\namong the trees of the forest?  15:3 Shall wood be taken thereof to do\r\nany work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?\r\n15:4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth\r\nboth the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any\r\nwork?  15:5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how\r\nmuch less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath\r\ndevoured it, and it is burned?  15:6 Therefore thus saith the Lord\r\nGOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have\r\ngiven to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n15:7 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one\r\nfire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am\r\nthe LORD, when I set my face against them.\r\n\r\n15:8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a\r\ntrespass, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n16:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 16:2 Son of man,\r\ncause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 16:3 And say, Thus saith the\r\nLord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of\r\nCanaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.\r\n\r\n16:4 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was\r\nnot cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast\r\nnot salted at all, nor swaddled at all.\r\n\r\n16:5 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have\r\ncompassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the\r\nlothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.\r\n\r\n16:6 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own\r\nblood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said\r\nunto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.\r\n\r\n16:7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou\r\nhast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent\r\nornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas\r\nthou wast naked and bare.\r\n\r\n16:8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time\r\nwas the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy\r\nnakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with\r\nthee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.\r\n\r\n16:9 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy\r\nblood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.\r\n\r\n16:10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with\r\nbadgers\xe2\x80\x99 skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered\r\nthee with silk.\r\n\r\n16:11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy\r\nhands, and a chain on thy neck.\r\n\r\n16:12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,\r\nand a beautiful crown upon thine head.\r\n\r\n16:13 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was\r\nof fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine\r\nflour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou\r\ndidst prosper into a kingdom.\r\n\r\n16:14 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for\r\nit was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n16:15 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the\r\nharlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on\r\nevery one that passed by; his it was.\r\n\r\n16:16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high\r\nplaces with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the\r\nlike things shall not come, neither shall it be so.\r\n\r\n16:17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my\r\nsilver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men,\r\nand didst commit whoredom with them, 16:18 And tookest thy broidered\r\ngarments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine\r\nincense before them.\r\n\r\n16:19 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,\r\nwherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet\r\nsavour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n16:20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou\r\nhast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be\r\ndevoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, 16:21 That thou\r\nhast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass\r\nthrough the fire for them?  16:22 And in all thine abominations and\r\nthy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when\r\nthou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.\r\n\r\n16:23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto\r\nthee!  saith the LORD GOD;) 16:24 That thou hast also built unto thee\r\nan eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.\r\n\r\n16:25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and\r\nhast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every\r\none that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.\r\n\r\n16:26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy\r\nneighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to\r\nprovoke me to anger.\r\n\r\n16:27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and\r\nhave diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will\r\nof them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are\r\nashamed of thy lewd way.\r\n\r\n16:28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou\r\nwast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet\r\ncouldest not be satisfied.\r\n\r\n16:29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of\r\nCanaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.\r\n\r\n16:30 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest\r\nall these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 16:31 In\r\nthat thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and\r\nmakest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an\r\nharlot, in that thou scornest hire; 16:32 But as a wife that\r\ncommitteth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!\r\n16:33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all\r\nthy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every\r\nside for thy whoredom.\r\n\r\n16:34 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,\r\nwhereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou\r\ngivest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\n16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 16:36 Thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness\r\ndiscovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the\r\nidols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which\r\nthou didst give unto them; 16:37 Behold, therefore I will gather all\r\nthy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou\r\nhast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather\r\nthem round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto\r\nthem, that they may see all thy nakedness.\r\n\r\n16:38 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed\r\nblood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.\r\n\r\n16:39 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw\r\ndown thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they\r\nshall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels,\r\nand leave thee naked and bare.\r\n\r\n16:40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall\r\nstone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.\r\n\r\n16:41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute\r\njudgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee\r\nto cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n16:42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy\r\nshall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n16:43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast\r\nfretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will\r\nrecompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt\r\nnot commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.\r\n\r\n16:44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb\r\nagainst thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.\r\n\r\n16:45 Thou art thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her\r\nchildren; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their\r\nhusbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your\r\nfather an Amorite.\r\n\r\n16:46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that\r\ndwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy\r\nright hand, is Sodom and her daughters.\r\n\r\n16:47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their\r\nabominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast\r\ncorrupted more than they in all thy ways.\r\n\r\n16:48 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,\r\nshe nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.\r\n\r\n16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,\r\nfulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her\r\ndaughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.\r\n\r\n16:50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:\r\ntherefore I took them away as I saw good.\r\n\r\n16:51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast\r\nmultiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy\r\nsisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.\r\n\r\n16:52 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame\r\nfor thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they\r\nare more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear\r\nthy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.\r\n\r\n16:53 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom\r\nand her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,\r\nthen will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of\r\nthem: 16:54 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be\r\nconfounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n16:55 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their\r\nformer estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their\r\nformer estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n16:56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day\r\nof thy pride, 16:57 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the\r\ntime of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round\r\nabout her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n16:58 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n16:59 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou\r\nhast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.\r\n\r\n16:60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days\r\nof thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.\r\n\r\n16:61 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou\r\nshalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will\r\ngive them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.\r\n\r\n16:62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know\r\nthat I am the LORD: 16:63 That thou mayest remember, and be\r\nconfounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame,\r\nwhen I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the\r\nLord GOD.\r\n\r\n17:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:2 Son of man,\r\nput forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; 17:3\r\nAnd say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings,\r\nlongwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto\r\nLebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 17:4 He cropped off\r\nthe top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he\r\nset it in a city of merchants.\r\n\r\n17:5 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a\r\nfruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n17:6 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose\r\nbranches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so\r\nit became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.\r\n\r\n17:7 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many\r\nfeathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and\r\nshot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the\r\nfurrows of her plantation.\r\n\r\n17:8 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might\r\nbring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a\r\ngoodly vine.\r\n\r\n17:9 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not\r\npull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it\r\nwither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without\r\ngreat power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.\r\n\r\n17:10 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not\r\nutterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the\r\nfurrows where it grew.\r\n\r\n17:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:12 Say\r\nnow to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?  tell\r\nthem, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken\r\nthe king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to\r\nBabylon; 17:13 And hath taken of the king\xe2\x80\x99s seed, and made a covenant\r\nwith him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty\r\nof the land: 17:14 That the kingdom might be base, that it might not\r\nlift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.\r\n\r\n17:15 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into\r\nEgypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he\r\nprosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the\r\ncovenant, and be delivered?  17:16 As I live, saith the Lord GOD,\r\nsurely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose\r\noath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the\r\nmidst of Babylon he shall die.\r\n\r\n17:17 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company\r\nmake for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to\r\ncut off many persons: 17:18 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking\r\nthe covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these\r\nthings, he shall not escape.\r\n\r\n17:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath\r\nthat he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it\r\nwill I recompense upon his own head.\r\n\r\n17:20 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my\r\nsnare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there\r\nfor his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.\r\n\r\n17:21 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the\r\nsword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and\r\nye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.\r\n\r\n17:22 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch\r\nof the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of\r\nhis young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain\r\nand eminent: 17:23 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I\r\nplant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a\r\ngoodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the\r\nshadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.\r\n\r\n17:24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have\r\nbrought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up\r\nthe green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD\r\nhave spoken and have done it.\r\n\r\n18:1 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 18:2 What mean\r\nye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,\r\nThe fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children\xe2\x80\x99s teeth are set\r\non edge?  18:3 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have\r\noccasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.\r\n\r\n18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also\r\nthe soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.\r\n\r\n18:5 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 18:6\r\nAnd hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes\r\nto the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his\r\nneighbours wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 18:7\r\nAnd hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his\r\npledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the\r\nhungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 18:8 He that hath\r\nnot given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath\r\nwithdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between\r\nman and man, 18:9 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my\r\njudgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the\r\nLord GOD.\r\n\r\n18:10 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that\r\ndoeth the like to any one of these things, 18:11 And that doeth not\r\nany of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and\r\ndefiled his neighbours wife, 18:12 Hath oppressed the poor and needy,\r\nhath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath\r\nlifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 18:13\r\nHath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then\r\nlive? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall\r\nsurely die; his blood shall be upon him.\r\n\r\n18:14 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father\xe2\x80\x99s sins\r\nwhich he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 18:15\r\nThat hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his\r\neyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his\r\nneighbours wife, 18:16 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not\r\nwithholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath\r\ngiven his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a\r\ngarment, 18:17 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath\r\nnot received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath\r\nwalked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his\r\nfather, he shall surely live.\r\n\r\n18:18 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his\r\nbrother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people,\r\nlo, even he shall die in his iniquity.\r\n\r\n18:19 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the\r\nfather?  When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and\r\nhath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.\r\n\r\n18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the\r\niniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of\r\nthe son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the\r\nwickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.\r\n\r\n18:21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath\r\ncommitted, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and\r\nright, he shall surely live, he shall not die.\r\n\r\n18:22 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be\r\nmentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n18:23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the\r\nLord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?\r\n18:24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and\r\ncommitteth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that\r\nthe wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he\r\nhath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath\r\ntrespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.\r\n\r\n18:25 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house\r\nof Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?  18:26 When\r\na righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth\r\niniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall\r\nhe die.\r\n\r\n18:27 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that\r\nhe hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall\r\nsave his soul alive.\r\n\r\n18:28 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his\r\ntransgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall\r\nnot die.\r\n\r\n18:29 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal.\r\nO house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?\r\n18:30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one\r\naccording to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves\r\nfrom all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.\r\n\r\n18:31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have\r\ntransgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will\r\nye die, O house of Israel?  18:32 For I have no pleasure in the death\r\nof him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and\r\nlive ye.\r\n\r\n19:1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,\r\n19:2 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,\r\nshe nourished her whelps among young lions.\r\n\r\n19:3 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and\r\nit learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.\r\n\r\n19:4 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and\r\nthey brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n19:5 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then\r\nshe took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.\r\n\r\n19:6 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion,\r\nand learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.\r\n\r\n19:7 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their\r\ncities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the\r\nnoise of his roaring.\r\n\r\n19:8 Then the nations set against him on every side from the\r\nprovinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.\r\n\r\n19:9 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king\r\nof Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more\r\nbe heard upon the mountains of Israel.\r\n\r\n19:10 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:\r\nshe was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.\r\n\r\n19:11 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,\r\nand her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared\r\nin her height with the multitude of her branches.\r\n\r\n19:12 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,\r\nand the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and\r\nwithered; the fire consumed them.\r\n\r\n19:13 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty\r\nground.\r\n\r\n19:14 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath\r\ndevoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to\r\nrule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.\r\n\r\n20:1 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the\r\ntenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to\r\nenquire of the LORD, and sat before me.\r\n\r\n20:2 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 20:3 Son of man,\r\nspeak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the\r\nLord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD,\r\nI will not be enquired of by you.\r\n\r\n20:4 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause\r\nthem to know the abominations of their fathers: 20:5 And say unto\r\nthem, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and\r\nlifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made\r\nmyself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine\r\nhand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God; 20:6 In the day that I\r\nlifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of\r\nEgypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and\r\nhoney, which is the glory of all lands: 20:7 Then said I unto them,\r\nCast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not\r\nyourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n20:8 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they\r\ndid not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither\r\ndid they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my\r\nfury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of\r\nthe land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n20:9 But I wrought for my name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that it should not be polluted\r\nbefore the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself\r\nknown unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n20:10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,\r\nand brought them into the wilderness.\r\n\r\n20:11 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which\r\nif a man do, he shall even live in them.\r\n\r\n20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me\r\nand them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.\r\n\r\n20:13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:\r\nthey walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which\r\nif a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly\r\npolluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the\r\nwilderness, to consume them.\r\n\r\n20:14 But I wrought for my name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that it should not be polluted\r\nbefore the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.\r\n\r\n20:15 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I\r\nwould not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing\r\nwith milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 20:16 Because\r\nthey despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but\r\npolluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.\r\n\r\n20:17 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither\r\ndid I make an end of them in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n20:18 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in\r\nthe statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor\r\ndefile yourselves with their idols: 20:19 I am the LORD your God; walk\r\nin my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; 20:20 And hallow\r\nmy sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may\r\nknow that I am the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n20:21 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked\r\nnot in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a\r\nman do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I\r\nsaid, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger\r\nagainst them in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n20:22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in\r\nwhose sight I brought them forth.\r\n\r\n20:23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I\r\nwould scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the\r\ncountries; 20:24 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had\r\ndespised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes\r\nwere after their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 idols.\r\n\r\n20:25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and\r\njudgments whereby they should not live; 20:26 And I polluted them in\r\ntheir own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that\r\nopeneth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that\r\nthey might know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:27 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say\r\nunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have\r\nblasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.\r\n\r\n20:28 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I\r\nlifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill,\r\nand all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and\r\nthere they presented the provocation of their offering: there also\r\nthey made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\n20:29 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?\r\nAnd the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.\r\n\r\n20:30 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nAre ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye\r\nwhoredom after their abominations?  20:31 For when ye offer your\r\ngifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute\r\nyourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be\r\nenquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD,\r\nI will not be enquired of by you.\r\n\r\n20:32 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that\r\nye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries,\r\nto serve wood and stone.\r\n\r\n20:33 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and\r\nwith a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over\r\nyou: 20:34 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather\r\nyou out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand,\r\nand with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.\r\n\r\n20:35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and\r\nthere will I plead with you face to face.\r\n\r\n20:36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the\r\nland of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n20:37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you\r\ninto the bond of the covenant: 20:38 And I will purge out from among\r\nyou the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them\r\nforth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter\r\ninto the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n20:39 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,\r\nserve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not\r\nhearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts,\r\nand with your idols.\r\n\r\n20:40 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of\r\nIsrael, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all\r\nof them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there\r\nwill I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations,\r\nwith all your holy things.\r\n\r\n20:41 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out\r\nfrom the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have\r\nbeen scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.\r\n\r\n20:42 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you\r\ninto the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up\r\nmine hand to give it to your fathers.\r\n\r\n20:43 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,\r\nwherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your\r\nown sight for all your evils that ye have committed.\r\n\r\n20:44 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with\r\nyou for my name\xe2\x80\x99s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor\r\naccording to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n20:45 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 20:46 Son of\r\nman, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the\r\nsouth, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; 20:47 And\r\nsay to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall\r\ndevour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame\r\nshall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall\r\nbe burned therein.\r\n\r\n20:48 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it\r\nshall not be quenched.\r\n\r\n20:49 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak\r\nparables?  21:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:2\r\nSon of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward\r\nthe holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 21:3 And say\r\nto the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee,\r\nand will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from\r\nthee the righteous and the wicked.\r\n\r\n21:4 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the\r\nwicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against\r\nall flesh from the south to the north: 21:5 That all flesh may know\r\nthat I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall\r\nnot return any more.\r\n\r\n21:6 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins;\r\nand with bitterness sigh before their eyes.\r\n\r\n21:7 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?\r\nthat thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every\r\nheart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit\r\nshall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh,\r\nand shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n21:8 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:9 Son of man,\r\nprophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is\r\nsharpened, and also furbished: 21:10 It is sharpened to make a sore\r\nslaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make\r\nmirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.\r\n\r\n21:11 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:\r\nthis sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand\r\nof the slayer.\r\n\r\n21:12 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it\r\nshall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the\r\nsword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.\r\n\r\n21:13 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the\r\nrod?  it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n21:14 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands\r\ntogether. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of\r\nthe slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which\r\nentereth into their privy chambers.\r\n\r\n21:15 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that\r\ntheir heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made\r\nbright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.\r\n\r\n21:16 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the\r\nleft, whithersoever thy face is set.\r\n\r\n21:17 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury\r\nto rest: I the LORD have said it.\r\n\r\n21:18 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 21:19 Also,\r\nthou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of\r\nBabylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and\r\nchoose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.\r\n\r\n21:20 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the\r\nAmmonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.\r\n\r\n21:21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the\r\nhead of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he\r\nconsulted with images, he looked in the liver.\r\n\r\n21:22 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint\r\ncaptains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice\r\nwith shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a\r\nmount, and to build a fort.\r\n\r\n21:23 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,\r\nto them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the\r\niniquity, that they may be taken.\r\n\r\n21:24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your\r\niniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered,\r\nso that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that\r\nye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.\r\n\r\n21:25 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,\r\nwhen iniquity shall have an end, 21:26 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove\r\nthe diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt\r\nhim that is low, and abase him that is high.\r\n\r\n21:27 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no\r\nmore, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.\r\n\r\n21:28 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD\r\nconcerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say\r\nthou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is\r\nfurbished, to consume because of the glittering: 21:29 Whiles they see\r\nvanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee\r\nupon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is\r\ncome, when their iniquity shall have an end.\r\n\r\n21:30 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in\r\nthe place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.\r\n\r\n21:31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow\r\nagainst thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand\r\nof brutish men, and skilful to destroy.\r\n\r\n21:32 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the\r\nmidst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD\r\nhave spoken it.\r\n\r\n22:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:2 Now,\r\nthou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?\r\nyea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.\r\n\r\n22:3 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood\r\nin the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against\r\nherself to defile herself.\r\n\r\n22:4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast\r\ndefiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast\r\ncaused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years:\r\ntherefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking\r\nto all countries.\r\n\r\n22:5 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock\r\nthee, which art infamous and much vexed.\r\n\r\n22:6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their\r\npower to shed blood.\r\n\r\n22:7 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of\r\nthee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have\r\nthey vexed the fatherless and the widow.\r\n\r\n22:8 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my\r\nsabbaths.\r\n\r\n22:9 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they\r\neat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.\r\n\r\n22:10 In thee have they discovered their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 nakedness: in thee\r\nhave they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.\r\n\r\n22:11 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife;\r\nand another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in\r\nthee hath humbled his sister, his father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n22:12 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken\r\nusury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by\r\nextortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n22:13 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain\r\nwhich thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n22:14 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the\r\ndays that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\n22:15 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in\r\nthe countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.\r\n\r\n22:16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of\r\nthe heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n22:17 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:18 Son of man,\r\nthe house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and\r\ntin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even\r\nthe dross of silver.\r\n\r\n22:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become\r\ndross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n22:20 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,\r\ninto the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it;\r\nso will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave\r\nyou there, and melt you.\r\n\r\n22:21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my\r\nwrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.\r\n\r\n22:22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be\r\nmelted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have\r\npoured out my fury upon you.\r\n\r\n22:23 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:24 Son of man,\r\nsay unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon\r\nin the day of indignation.\r\n\r\n22:25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like\r\na roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have\r\ntaken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows\r\nin the midst thereof.\r\n\r\n22:26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy\r\nthings: they have put no difference between the holy and profane,\r\nneither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean,\r\nand have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n22:27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the\r\nprey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.\r\n\r\n22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing\r\nvanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD,\r\nwhen the LORD hath not spoken.\r\n\r\n22:29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised\r\nrobbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed\r\nthe stranger wrongfully.\r\n\r\n22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the\r\nhedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not\r\ndestroy it: but I found none.\r\n\r\n22:31 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have\r\nconsumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I\r\nrecompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n23:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 23:2 Son of man,\r\nthere were two women, the daughters of one mother: 23:3 And they\r\ncommitted whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth:\r\nthere were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of\r\ntheir virginity.\r\n\r\n23:4 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her\r\nsister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus\r\nwere their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.\r\n\r\n23:5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on\r\nher lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, 23:6 Which were clothed\r\nwith blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men,\r\nhorsemen riding upon horses.\r\n\r\n23:7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that\r\nwere the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with\r\nall their idols she defiled herself.\r\n\r\n23:8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her\r\nyouth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her\r\nvirginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.\r\n\r\n23:9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into\r\nthe hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.\r\n\r\n23:10 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her\r\ndaughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among\r\nwomen; for they had executed judgment upon her.\r\n\r\n23:11 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in\r\nher inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her\r\nsister in her whoredoms.\r\n\r\n23:12 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers\r\nclothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them\r\ndesirable young men.\r\n\r\n23:13 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,\r\n23:14 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men\r\npourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with\r\nvermilion, 23:15 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in\r\ndyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after\r\nthe manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:\r\n23:16 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,\r\nand sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.\r\n\r\n23:17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they\r\ndefiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and\r\nher mind was alienated from them.\r\n\r\n23:18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:\r\nthen my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated\r\nfrom her sister.\r\n\r\n23:19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the\r\ndays of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n23:20 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh\r\nof asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.\r\n\r\n23:21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in\r\nbruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.\r\n\r\n23:22 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will\r\nraise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and\r\nI will bring them against thee on every side; 23:23 The Babylonians,\r\nand all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians\r\nwith them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great\r\nlords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.\r\n\r\n23:24 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and\r\nwheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee\r\nbuckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment\r\nbefore them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.\r\n\r\n23:25 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal\r\nfuriously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and\r\nthy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy\r\ndaughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.\r\n\r\n23:26 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy\r\nfair jewels.\r\n\r\n23:27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy\r\nwhoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift\r\nup thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.\r\n\r\n23:28 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into\r\nthe hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy\r\nmind is alienated: 23:29 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and\r\nshall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare:\r\nand the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy\r\nlewdness and thy whoredoms.\r\n\r\n23:30 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a\r\nwhoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their\r\nidols.\r\n\r\n23:31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give\r\nher cup into thine hand.\r\n\r\n23:32 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister\xe2\x80\x99s cup\r\ndeep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it\r\ncontaineth much.\r\n\r\n23:33 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup\r\nof astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.\r\n\r\n23:34 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break\r\nthe sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken\r\nit, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n23:35 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten\r\nme, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness\r\nand thy whoredoms.\r\n\r\n23:36 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge\r\nAholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 23:37\r\nThat they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and\r\nwith their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused\r\ntheir sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire,\r\nto devour them.\r\n\r\n23:38 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my\r\nsanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.\r\n\r\n23:39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they\r\ncame the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have\r\nthey done in the midst of mine house.\r\n\r\n23:40 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,\r\nunto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou\r\ndidst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with\r\nornaments, 23:41 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared\r\nbefore it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.\r\n\r\n23:42 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with\r\nthe men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness,\r\nwhich put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n23:43 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now\r\ncommit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  23:44 Yet they went in\r\nunto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went\r\nthey in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.\r\n\r\n23:45 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of\r\nadulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because\r\nthey are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.\r\n\r\n23:46 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon\r\nthem, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.\r\n\r\n23:47 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them\r\nwith their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and\r\nburn up their houses with fire.\r\n\r\n23:48 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all\r\nwomen may be taught not to do after your lewdness.\r\n\r\n23:49 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall\r\nbear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n24:1 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of\r\nthe month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:2 Son of man,\r\nwrite thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of\r\nBabylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.\r\n\r\n24:3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them,\r\nThus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water\r\ninto it: 24:4 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good\r\npiece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.\r\n\r\n24:5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it,\r\nand make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.\r\n\r\n24:6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the\r\npot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring\r\nit out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.\r\n\r\n24:7 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of\r\na rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 24:8\r\nThat it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her\r\nblood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.\r\n\r\n24:9 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will\r\neven make the pile for fire great.\r\n\r\n24:10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it\r\nwell, and let the bones be burned.\r\n\r\n24:11 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it\r\nmay be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten\r\nin it, that the scum of it may be consumed.\r\n\r\n24:12 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not\r\nforth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.\r\n\r\n24:13 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and\r\nthou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any\r\nmore, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.\r\n\r\n24:14 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do\r\nit; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent;\r\naccording to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge\r\nthee, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n24:15 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:16 Son of\r\nman, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a\r\nstroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears\r\nrun down.\r\n\r\n24:17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of\r\nthine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover\r\nnot thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.\r\n\r\n24:18 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife\r\ndied; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.\r\n\r\n24:19 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these\r\nthings are to us, that thou doest so?  24:20 Then I answered them, The\r\nword of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:21 Speak unto the house of\r\nIsrael, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary,\r\nthe excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that\r\nwhich your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have\r\nleft shall fall by the sword.\r\n\r\n24:22 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,\r\nnor eat the bread of men.\r\n\r\n24:23 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon\r\nyour feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for\r\nyour iniquities, and mourn one toward another.\r\n\r\n24:24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath\r\ndone shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the\r\nLord GOD.\r\n\r\n24:25 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take\r\nfrom them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their\r\neyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their\r\ndaughters, 24:26 That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto\r\nthee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?  24:27 In that day\r\nshall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt\r\nspeak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and\r\nthey shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 25:2 Son of man,\r\nset thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 25:3\r\nAnd say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it\r\nwas profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate;\r\nand against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 25:4\r\nBehold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a\r\npossession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their\r\ndwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n25:5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a\r\ncouching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:6 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine\r\nhands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy\r\ndespite against the land of Israel; 25:7 Behold, therefore I will\r\nstretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to\r\nthe heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause\r\nthee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou\r\nshalt know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:8 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,\r\nBehold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen; 25:9\r\nTherefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from\r\nhis cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country,\r\nBethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim, 25:10 Unto the men of the\r\neast with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the\r\nAmmonites may not be remembered among the nations.\r\n\r\n25:11 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that\r\nI am the LORD.\r\n\r\n25:12 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against\r\nthe house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and\r\nrevenged himself upon them; 25:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I\r\nwill also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and\r\nbeast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of\r\nDedan shall fall by the sword.\r\n\r\n25:14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people\r\nIsrael: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and\r\naccording to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n25:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by\r\nrevenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy\r\nit for the old hatred; 25:16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nBehold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will\r\ncut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.\r\n\r\n25:17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious\r\nrebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my\r\nvengeance upon them.\r\n\r\n26:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the\r\nmonth, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 26:2 Son of\r\nman, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is\r\nbroken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I\r\nshall be replenished, now she is laid waste: 26:3 Therefore thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many\r\nnations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come\r\nup.\r\n\r\n26:4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her\r\ntowers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the\r\ntop of a rock.\r\n\r\n26:5 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the\r\nsea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a\r\nspoil to the nations.\r\n\r\n26:6 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the\r\nsword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus\r\nNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with\r\nhorses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n26:8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he\r\nshall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and\r\nlift up the buckler against thee.\r\n\r\n26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his\r\naxes he shall break down thy towers.\r\n\r\n26:10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover\r\nthee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the\r\nwheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as\r\nmen enter into a city wherein is made a breach.\r\n\r\n26:11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy\r\nstreets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong\r\ngarrisons shall go down to the ground.\r\n\r\n26:12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of\r\nthy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy\r\npleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy\r\ndust in the midst of the water.\r\n\r\n26:13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound\r\nof thy harps shall be no more heard.\r\n\r\n26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a\r\nplace to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD\r\nhave spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n26:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at\r\nthe sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is\r\nmade in the midst of thee?  26:16 Then all the princes of the sea\r\nshall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put\r\noff their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with\r\ntrembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every\r\nmoment, and be astonished at thee.\r\n\r\n26:17 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,\r\nHow art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the\r\nrenowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants,\r\nwhich cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!  26:18 Now shall\r\nthe isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in\r\nthe sea shall be troubled at thy departure.\r\n\r\n26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate\r\ncity, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up\r\nthe deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; 26:20 When I\r\nshall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the\r\npeople of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth,\r\nin places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that\r\nthou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the\r\nliving; 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more:\r\nthough thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n27:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 27:2 Now, thou\r\nson of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 27:3 And say unto Tyrus,\r\nO thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant\r\nof the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou\r\nhast said, I am of perfect beauty.\r\n\r\n27:4 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have\r\nperfected thy beauty.\r\n\r\n27:5 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they\r\nhave taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.\r\n\r\n27:6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of\r\nthe Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles\r\nof Chittim.\r\n\r\n27:7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou\r\nspreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of\r\nElishah was that which covered thee.\r\n\r\n27:8 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise\r\nmen, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.\r\n\r\n27:9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy\r\ncalkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to\r\noccupy thy merchandise.\r\n\r\n27:10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy\r\nmen of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth\r\nthy comeliness.\r\n\r\n27:11 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round\r\nabout, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields\r\nupon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.\r\n\r\n27:12 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind\r\nof riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.\r\n\r\n27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded\r\nthe persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.\r\n\r\n27:14 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses\r\nand horsemen and mules.\r\n\r\n27:15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the\r\nmerchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of\r\nivory and ebony.\r\n\r\n27:16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares\r\nof thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and\r\nbroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.\r\n\r\n27:17 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they\r\ntraded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil,\r\nand balm.\r\n\r\n27:18 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy\r\nmaking, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and\r\nwhite wool.\r\n\r\n27:19 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:\r\nbright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.\r\n\r\n27:20 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.\r\n\r\n27:21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in\r\nlambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.\r\n\r\n27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they\r\noccupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious\r\nstones, and gold.\r\n\r\n27:23 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and\r\nChilmad, were thy merchants.\r\n\r\n27:24 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue\r\nclothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with\r\ncords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.\r\n\r\n27:25 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou\r\nwast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.\r\n\r\n27:26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind\r\nhath broken thee in the midst of the seas.\r\n\r\n27:27 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and\r\nthy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all\r\nthy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in\r\nthe midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of\r\nthy ruin.\r\n\r\n27:28 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.\r\n\r\n27:29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of\r\nthe sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the\r\nland; 27:30 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and\r\nshall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they\r\nshall wallow themselves in the ashes: 27:31 And they shall make\r\nthemselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and\r\nthey shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.\r\n\r\n27:32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee,\r\nand lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the\r\ndestroyed in the midst of the sea?  27:33 When thy wares went forth\r\nout of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the\r\nkings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\n27:34 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths\r\nof the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee\r\nshall fall.\r\n\r\n27:35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,\r\nand their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n27:36 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be\r\na terror, and never shalt be any more.\r\n\r\n28:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 28:2 Son of man,\r\nsay unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine\r\nheart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat\r\nof God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God,\r\nthough thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 28:3 Behold, thou art\r\nwiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:\r\n28:4 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten\r\nthee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: 28:5\r\nBy thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy\r\nriches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: 28:6\r\nTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart\r\nas the heart of God; 28:7 Behold, therefore I will bring strangers\r\nupon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their\r\nswords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\n28:8 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the\r\ndeaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.\r\n\r\n28:9 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but\r\nthou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.\r\n\r\n28:10 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of\r\nstrangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n28:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:12 Son of\r\nman, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him,\r\nThus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and\r\nperfect in beauty.\r\n\r\n28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone\r\nwas thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the\r\nonyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle,\r\nand gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared\r\nin thee in the day that thou wast created.\r\n\r\n28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee\r\nso: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and\r\ndown in the midst of the stones of fire.\r\n\r\n28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast\r\ncreated, till iniquity was found in thee.\r\n\r\n28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst\r\nof thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast\r\nthee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O\r\ncovering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.\r\n\r\n28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast\r\ncorrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to\r\nthe ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.\r\n\r\n28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine\r\niniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring\r\nforth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will\r\nbring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that\r\nbehold thee.\r\n\r\n28:19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at\r\nthee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.\r\n\r\n28:20 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:21 Son of\r\nman, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 28:22 And\r\nsay, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and\r\nI will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I\r\nam the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be\r\nsanctified in her.\r\n\r\n28:23 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets;\r\nand the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon\r\nher on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n28:24 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of\r\nIsrael, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that\r\ndespised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n28:25 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of\r\nIsrael from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be\r\nsanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell\r\nin their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.\r\n\r\n28:26 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and\r\nplant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have\r\nexecuted judgments upon all those that despise them round about them;\r\nand they shall know that I am the LORD their God.\r\n\r\n29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the\r\nmonth, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 29:2 Son of man, set\r\nthy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and\r\nagainst all Egypt: 29:3 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nBehold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon\r\nthat lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is\r\nmine own, and I have made it for myself.\r\n\r\n29:4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of\r\nthy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of\r\nthe midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick\r\nunto thy scales.\r\n\r\n29:5 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all\r\nthe fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou\r\nshalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for\r\nmeat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.\r\n\r\n29:6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD,\r\nbecause they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n29:7 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and\r\nrend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest,\r\nand madest all their loins to be at a stand.\r\n\r\n29:8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword\r\nupon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.\r\n\r\n29:9 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall\r\nknow that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and\r\nI have made it.\r\n\r\n29:10 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and\r\nI will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the\r\ntower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n29:11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall\r\npass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.\r\n\r\n29:12 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the\r\ncountries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are\r\nlaid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the\r\nEgyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n29:13 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I\r\ngather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:\r\n29:14 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause\r\nthem to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their\r\nhabitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.\r\n\r\n29:15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt\r\nitself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they\r\nshall no more rule over the nations.\r\n\r\n29:16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,\r\nwhich bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look\r\nafter them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n29:17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the\r\nfirst month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came\r\nunto me, saying, 29:18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon\r\ncaused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was\r\nmade bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his\r\narmy, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 29:19\r\nTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of\r\nEgypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her\r\nmultitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the\r\nwages for his army.\r\n\r\n29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he\r\nserved against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n29:21 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud\r\nforth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of\r\nthem; and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:1 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 30:2 Son of man,\r\nprophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!\r\n30:3 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy\r\nday; it shall be the time of the heathen.\r\n\r\n30:4 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in\r\nEthiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away\r\nher multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.\r\n\r\n30:5 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and\r\nChub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them\r\nby the sword.\r\n\r\n30:6 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and\r\nthe pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall\r\nthey fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n30:7 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are\r\ndesolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n30:8 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in\r\nEgypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\n30:9 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make\r\nthe careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them,\r\nas in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.\r\n\r\n30:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt\r\nto cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n30:11 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall\r\nbe brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords\r\nagainst Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.\r\n\r\n30:12 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand\r\nof the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is\r\ntherein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.\r\n\r\n30:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I\r\nwill cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no\r\nmore a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\n30:14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and\r\nwill execute judgments in No.\r\n\r\n30:15 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I\r\nwill cut off the multitude of No.\r\n\r\n30:16 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No\r\nshall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.\r\n\r\n30:17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:\r\nand these cities shall go into captivity.\r\n\r\n30:18 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall\r\nbreak there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall\r\ncease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters\r\nshall go into captivity.\r\n\r\n30:19 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that\r\nI am the LORD.\r\n\r\n30:20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in\r\nthe seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,\r\nsaying, 30:21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of\r\nEgypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller\r\nto bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.\r\n\r\n30:22 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh\r\nking of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was\r\nbroken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.\r\n\r\n30:23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will\r\ndisperse them through the countries.\r\n\r\n30:24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put\r\nmy sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and he shall\r\ngroan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.\r\n\r\n30:25 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the\r\narms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the\r\nLORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,\r\nand he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n30:26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse\r\nthem among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in\r\nthe first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,\r\nsaying, 31:2 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his\r\nmultitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?  31:3 Behold, the\r\nAssyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a\r\nshadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the\r\nthick boughs.\r\n\r\n31:4 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her\r\nrivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto\r\nall the trees of the field.\r\n\r\n31:5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the\r\nfield, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long\r\nbecause of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.\r\n\r\n31:6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under\r\nhis branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young,\r\nand under his shadow dwelt all great nations.\r\n\r\n31:7 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:\r\nfor his root was by great waters.\r\n\r\n31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees\r\nwere not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his\r\nbranches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n31:9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that\r\nall the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.\r\n\r\n31:10 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up\r\nthyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs,\r\nand his heart is lifted up in his height; 31:11 I have therefore\r\ndelivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall\r\nsurely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.\r\n\r\n31:12 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,\r\nand have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his\r\nbranches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of\r\nthe land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his\r\nshadow, and have left him.\r\n\r\n31:13 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all\r\nthe beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 31:14 To the end\r\nthat none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their\r\nheight, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither\r\ntheir trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they\r\nare all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the\r\nmidst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.\r\n\r\n31:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the\r\ngrave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I\r\nrestrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I\r\ncaused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field\r\nfainted for him.\r\n\r\n31:16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I\r\ncast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the\r\ntrees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water,\r\nshall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n31:17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain\r\nwith the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his\r\nshadow in the midst of the heathen.\r\n\r\n31:18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the\r\ntrees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden\r\nunto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the\r\nuncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh\r\nand all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in\r\nthe first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,\r\nsaying, 32:2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of\r\nEgypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,\r\nand thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy\r\nrivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n32:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over\r\nthee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my\r\nnet.\r\n\r\n32:4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon\r\nthe open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain\r\nupon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.\r\n\r\n32:5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys\r\nwith thy height.\r\n\r\n32:6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,\r\neven to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.\r\n\r\n32:7 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make\r\nthe stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the\r\nmoon shall not give her light.\r\n\r\n32:8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and\r\nset darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n32:9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy\r\ndestruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n32:10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings\r\nshall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword\r\nbefore them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his\r\nown life, in the day of thy fall.\r\n\r\n32:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon\r\nshall come upon thee.\r\n\r\n32:12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,\r\nthe terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the\r\npomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\n32:13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great\r\nwaters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the\r\nhoofs of beasts trouble them.\r\n\r\n32:14 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to\r\nrun like oil, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n32:15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country\r\nshall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all\r\nthem that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n32:16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the\r\ndaughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her,\r\neven for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n32:17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day\r\nof the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 32:18\r\nSon of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even\r\nher, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of\r\nthe earth, with them that go down into the pit.\r\n\r\n32:19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with\r\nthe uncircumcised.\r\n\r\n32:20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the\r\nsword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.\r\n\r\n32:21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst\r\nof hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie\r\nuncircumcised, slain by the sword.\r\n\r\n32:22 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:\r\nall of them slain, fallen by the sword: 32:23 Whose graves are set in\r\nthe sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of\r\nthem slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of\r\nthe living.\r\n\r\n32:24 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all\r\nof them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised\r\ninto the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the\r\nland of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go\r\ndown to the pit.\r\n\r\n32:25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her\r\nmultitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised,\r\nslain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the\r\nliving, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the\r\npit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.\r\n\r\n32:26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are\r\nround about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though\r\nthey caused their terror in the land of the living.\r\n\r\n32:27 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the\r\nuncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war:\r\nand they have laid their swords under their heads, but their\r\niniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of\r\nthe mighty in the land of the living.\r\n\r\n32:28 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and\r\nshalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.\r\n\r\n32:29 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their\r\nmight are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie\r\nwith the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.\r\n\r\n32:30 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the\r\nZidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they\r\nare ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that\r\nbe slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to\r\nthe pit.\r\n\r\n32:31 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his\r\nmultitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the\r\nLord GOD.\r\n\r\n32:32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he\r\nshall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are\r\nslain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the\r\nLord GOD.\r\n\r\n33:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:2 Son of man,\r\nspeak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring\r\nthe sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their\r\ncoasts, and set him for their watchman: 33:3 If when he seeth the\r\nsword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;\r\n33:4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not\r\nwarning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon\r\nhis own head.\r\n\r\n33:5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his\r\nblood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n33:6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,\r\nand the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person\r\nfrom among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will\r\nI require at the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n33:7 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house\r\nof Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn\r\nthem from me.\r\n\r\n33:8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;\r\nif thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked\r\nman shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n33:9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;\r\nif he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou\r\nhast delivered thy soul.\r\n\r\n33:10 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;\r\nThus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us,\r\nand we pine away in them, how should we then live?  33:11 Say unto\r\nthem, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death\r\nof the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn\r\nye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of\r\nIsrael?  33:12 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of\r\nthy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him\r\nin the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked,\r\nhe shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his\r\nwickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his\r\nrighteousness in the day that he sinneth.\r\n\r\n33:13 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if\r\nhe trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his\r\nrighteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he\r\nhath committed, he shall die for it.\r\n\r\n33:14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he\r\nturn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 33:15 If the\r\nwicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the\r\nstatutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live,\r\nhe shall not die.\r\n\r\n33:16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto\r\nhim: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n33:17 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not\r\nequal: but as for them, their way is not equal.\r\n\r\n33:18 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and\r\ncommitteth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.\r\n\r\n33:19 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is\r\nlawful and right, he shall live thereby.\r\n\r\n33:20 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of\r\nIsrael, I will judge you every one after his ways.\r\n\r\n33:21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the\r\ntenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped\r\nout of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.\r\n\r\n33:22 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he\r\nthat was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in\r\nthe morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.\r\n\r\n33:23 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:24 Son of\r\nman, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak,\r\nsaying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many;\r\nthe land is given us for inheritance.\r\n\r\n33:25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with\r\nthe blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood:\r\nand shall ye possess the land?  33:26 Ye stand upon your sword, ye\r\nwork abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbours wife: and\r\nshall ye possess the land?  33:27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall\r\nby the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the\r\nbeasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves\r\nshall die of the pestilence.\r\n\r\n33:28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her\r\nstrength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate,\r\nthat none shall pass through.\r\n\r\n33:29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the\r\nland most desolate because of all their abominations which they have\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n33:30 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are\r\ntalking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and\r\nspeak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray\r\nyou, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.\r\n\r\n33:31 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit\r\nbefore thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not\r\ndo them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart\r\ngoeth after their covetousness.\r\n\r\n33:32 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that\r\nhath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they\r\nhear thy words, but they do them not.\r\n\r\n33:33 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall\r\nthey know that a prophet hath been among them.\r\n\r\n34:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 34:2 Son of man,\r\nprophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them,\r\nThus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of\r\nIsrael that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the\r\nflocks?  34:3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill\r\nthem that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.\r\n\r\n34:4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed\r\nthat which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken,\r\nneither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have\r\nye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye\r\nruled them.\r\n\r\n34:5 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they\r\nbecame meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.\r\n\r\n34:6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high\r\nhill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and\r\nnone did search or seek after them.\r\n\r\n34:7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:8 As I\r\nlive, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and\r\nmy flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no\r\nshepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the\r\nshepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 34:9 Therefore, O ye\r\nshepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nBehold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at\r\ntheir hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither\r\nshall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my\r\nflock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.\r\n\r\n34:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search\r\nmy sheep, and seek them out.\r\n\r\n34:12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among\r\nhis sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will\r\ndeliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the\r\ncloudy and dark day.\r\n\r\n34:13 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from\r\nthe countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them\r\nupon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited\r\nplaces of the country.\r\n\r\n34:14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains\r\nof Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold,\r\nand in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.\r\n\r\n34:15 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n34:16 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was\r\ndriven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will\r\nstrengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the\r\nstrong; I will feed them with judgment.\r\n\r\n34:17 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I\r\njudge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.\r\n\r\n34:18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good\r\npasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your\r\npastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the\r\nresidue with your feet?  34:19 And as for my flock, they eat that\r\nwhich ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye\r\nhave fouled with your feet.\r\n\r\n34:20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I,\r\nwill judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.\r\n\r\n34:21 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed\r\nall the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;\r\n34:22 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a\r\nprey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.\r\n\r\n34:23 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed\r\nthem, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their\r\nshepherd.\r\n\r\n34:24 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince\r\namong them; I the LORD have spoken it.\r\n\r\n34:25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause\r\nthe evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely\r\nin the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.\r\n\r\n34:26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a\r\nblessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season;\r\nthere shall be showers of blessing.\r\n\r\n34:27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth\r\nshall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and\r\nshall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their\r\nyoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served\r\nthemselves of them.\r\n\r\n34:28 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall\r\nthe beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and\r\nnone shall make them afraid.\r\n\r\n34:29 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall\r\nbe no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of\r\nthe heathen any more.\r\n\r\n34:30 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and\r\nthat they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n34:31 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your\r\nGod, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n35:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 35:2 Son of\r\nman, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 35:3\r\nAnd say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am\r\nagainst thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I\r\nwill make thee most desolate.\r\n\r\n35:4 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou\r\nshalt know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n35:5 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood\r\nof the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of\r\ntheir calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: 35:6\r\nTherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto\r\nblood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood,\r\neven blood shall pursue thee.\r\n\r\n35:7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it\r\nhim that passeth out and him that returneth.\r\n\r\n35:8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills,\r\nand in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are\r\nslain with the sword.\r\n\r\n35:9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not\r\nreturn: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n35:10 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two\r\ncountries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was\r\nthere: 35:11 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do\r\naccording to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast\r\nused out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known\r\namong them, when I have judged thee.\r\n\r\n35:12 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard\r\nall thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of\r\nIsrael, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.\r\n\r\n35:13 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have\r\nmultiplied your words against me: I have heard them.\r\n\r\n35:14 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will\r\nmake thee desolate.\r\n\r\n35:15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,\r\nbecause it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be\r\ndesolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall\r\nknow that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n36:1 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and\r\nsay, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD: 36:2 Thus\r\nsaith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even\r\nthe ancient high places are ours in possession: 36:3 Therefore\r\nprophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you\r\ndesolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a\r\npossession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the\r\nlips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: 36:4 Therefore, ye\r\nmountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the\r\nLord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the\r\nvalleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken,\r\nwhich became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that\r\nare round about; 36:5 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the\r\nfire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen,\r\nand against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their\r\npossession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to\r\ncast it out for a prey.\r\n\r\n36:6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto\r\nthe mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys,\r\nThus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in\r\nmy fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 36:7\r\nTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely\r\nthe heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.\r\n\r\n36:8 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your\r\nbranches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at\r\nhand to come.\r\n\r\n36:9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall\r\nbe tilled and sown: 36:10 And I will multiply men upon you, all the\r\nhouse of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited,\r\nand the wastes shall be builded: 36:11 And I will multiply upon you\r\nman and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will\r\nsettle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at\r\nyour beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n36:12 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;\r\nand they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and\r\nthou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.\r\n\r\n36:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land\r\ndevourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations: 36:14 Therefore thou\r\nshalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n36:15 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the\r\nheathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people\r\nany more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n36:16 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 36:17 Son of\r\nman, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it\r\nby their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the\r\nuncleanness of a removed woman.\r\n\r\n36:18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had\r\nshed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted\r\nit: 36:19 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were\r\ndispersed through the countries: according to their way and according\r\nto their doings I judged them.\r\n\r\n36:20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they\r\nprofaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of\r\nthe LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.\r\n\r\n36:21 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had\r\nprofaned among the heathen, whither they went.\r\n\r\n36:22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nI do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n36:23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the\r\nheathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen\r\nshall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be\r\nsanctified in you before their eyes.\r\n\r\n36:24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out\r\nof all countries, and will bring you into your own land.\r\n\r\n36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be\r\nclean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I\r\ncleanse you.\r\n\r\n36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put\r\nwithin you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,\r\nand I will give you an heart of flesh.\r\n\r\n36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my\r\nstatutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.\r\n\r\n36:28 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and\r\nye shall be my people, and I will be your God.\r\n\r\n36:29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will\r\ncall for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.\r\n\r\n36:30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of\r\nthe field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the\r\nheathen.\r\n\r\n36:31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that\r\nwere not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your\r\niniquities and for your abominations.\r\n\r\n36:32 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known\r\nunto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n36:33 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed\r\nyou from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the\r\ncities, and the wastes shall be builded.\r\n\r\n36:34 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate\r\nin the sight of all that passed by.\r\n\r\n36:35 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like\r\nthe garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are\r\nbecome fenced, and are inhabited.\r\n\r\n36:36 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I\r\nthe LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I\r\nthe LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.\r\n\r\n36:37 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by\r\nthe house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men\r\nlike a flock.\r\n\r\n36:38 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn\r\nfeasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and\r\nthey shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the\r\nspirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which\r\nwas full of bones, 37:2 And caused me to pass by them round about:\r\nand, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they\r\nwere very dry.\r\n\r\n37:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I\r\nanswered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.\r\n\r\n37:4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto\r\nthem, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:5 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause\r\nbreath to enter into you, and ye shall live: 37:6 And I will lay\r\nsinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with\r\nskin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that\r\nI am the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there\r\nwas a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone\r\nto his bone.\r\n\r\n37:8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon\r\nthem, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n37:9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of\r\nman, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four\r\nwinds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.\r\n\r\n37:10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into\r\nthem, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n37:11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole\r\nhouse of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope\r\nis lost: we are cut off for our parts.\r\n\r\n37:12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;\r\nBehold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up\r\nout of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.\r\n\r\n37:13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your\r\ngraves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 37:14 And\r\nshall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you\r\nin your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it,\r\nand performed it, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n37:15 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 37:16 Moreover,\r\nthou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah,\r\nand for the children of Israel his companions: then take another\r\nstick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all\r\nthe house of Israel his companions: 37:17 And join them one to another\r\ninto one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.\r\n\r\n37:18 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,\r\nsaying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?  37:19 Say\r\nunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of\r\nJoseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his\r\nfellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and\r\nmake them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.\r\n\r\n37:20 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand\r\nbefore their eyes.\r\n\r\n37:21 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take\r\nthe children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone,\r\nand will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own\r\nland: 37:22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the\r\nmountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they\r\nshall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two\r\nkingdoms any more at all.\r\n\r\n37:23 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,\r\nnor with their detestable things, nor with any of their\r\ntransgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces,\r\nwherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my\r\npeople, and I will be their God.\r\n\r\n37:24 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall\r\nhave one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe\r\nmy statutes, and do them.\r\n\r\n37:25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my\r\nservant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell\r\ntherein, even they, and their children, and their children\xe2\x80\x99s children\r\nfor ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.\r\n\r\n37:26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be\r\nan everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply\r\nthem, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.\r\n\r\n37:27 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God,\r\nand they shall be my people.\r\n\r\n37:28 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,\r\nwhen my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.\r\n\r\n38:1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 38:2 Son of man,\r\nset thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of\r\nMeshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 38:3 And say, Thus saith\r\nthe Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of\r\nMeshech and Tubal: 38:4 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into\r\nthy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and\r\nhorsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great\r\ncompany with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords: 38:5\r\nPersia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and\r\nhelmet: 38:6 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the\r\nnorth quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.\r\n\r\n38:7 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy\r\ncompany that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.\r\n\r\n38:8 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou\r\nshalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is\r\ngathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which\r\nhave been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations,\r\nand they shall dwell safely all of them.\r\n\r\n38:9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a\r\ncloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n38:10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the\r\nsame time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an\r\nevil thought: 38:11 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of\r\nunwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell\r\nsafely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars\r\nnor gates, 38:12 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine\r\nhand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the\r\npeople that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle\r\nand goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.\r\n\r\n38:13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the\r\nyoung lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a\r\nspoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away\r\nsilver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?\r\n38:14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the\r\nLord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt\r\nthou not know it?  38:15 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the\r\nnorth parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon\r\nhorses, a great company, and a mighty army: 38:16 And thou shalt come\r\nup against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall\r\nbe in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the\r\nheathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\n38:17 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in\r\nold time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in\r\nthose days many years that I would bring thee against them?  38:18 And\r\nit shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the\r\nland of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my\r\nface.\r\n\r\n38:19 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,\r\nSurely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of\r\nIsrael; 38:20 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the\r\nheaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that\r\ncreep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the\r\nearth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown\r\ndown, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n38:21 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my\r\nmountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man\xe2\x80\x99s sword shall be against his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n38:22 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and\r\nI will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people\r\nthat are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire,\r\nand brimstone.\r\n\r\n38:23 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be\r\nknown in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n39:1 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus\r\nsaith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince\r\nof Meshech and Tubal: 39:2 And I will turn thee back, and leave but\r\nthe sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north\r\nparts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: 39:3 And I\r\nwill smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows\r\nto fall out of thy right hand.\r\n\r\n39:4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy\r\nbands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the\r\nravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be\r\ndevoured.\r\n\r\n39:5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n39:6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell\r\ncarelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.\r\n\r\n39:7 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people\r\nIsrael; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the\r\nheathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.\r\n\r\n39:8 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is\r\nthe day whereof I have spoken.\r\n\r\n39:9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and\r\nshall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the\r\nbucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears,\r\nand they shall burn them with fire seven years: 39:10 So that they\r\nshall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the\r\nforests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall\r\nspoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n39:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog\r\na place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the\r\neast of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and\r\nthere shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call\r\nit The valley of Hamongog.\r\n\r\n39:12 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,\r\nthat they may cleanse the land.\r\n\r\n39:13 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be\r\nto them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n39:14 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing\r\nthrough the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon\r\nthe face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months\r\nshall they search.\r\n\r\n39:15 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have\r\nburied it in the valley of Hamongog.\r\n\r\n39:16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they\r\ncleanse the land.\r\n\r\n39:17 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every\r\nfeathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves,\r\nand come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do\r\nsacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of\r\nIsrael, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.\r\n\r\n39:18 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the\r\nprinces of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks,\r\nall of them fatlings of Bashan.\r\n\r\n39:19 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be\r\ndrunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.\r\n\r\n39:20 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,\r\nwith mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n39:21 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen\r\nshall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have\r\nlaid upon them.\r\n\r\n39:22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God\r\nfrom that day and forward.\r\n\r\n39:23 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into\r\ncaptivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me,\r\ntherefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of\r\ntheir enemies: so fell they all by the sword.\r\n\r\n39:24 According to their uncleanness and according to their\r\ntransgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.\r\n\r\n39:25 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the\r\ncaptivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and\r\nwill be jealous for my holy name; 39:26 After that they have borne\r\ntheir shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed\r\nagainst me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n39:27 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered\r\nthem out of their enemies\xe2\x80\x99 lands, and am sanctified in them in the\r\nsight of many nations; 39:28 Then shall they know that I am the LORD\r\ntheir God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the\r\nheathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left\r\nnone of them any more there.\r\n\r\n39:29 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have\r\npoured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n40:1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning\r\nof the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year\r\nafter that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the\r\nLORD was upon me, and brought me thither.\r\n\r\n40:2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and\r\nset me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city\r\non the south.\r\n\r\n40:3 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose\r\nappearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in\r\nhis hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.\r\n\r\n40:4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and\r\nhear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew\r\nthee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou\r\nbrought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n40:5 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an\r\nhand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed;\r\nand the height, one reed.\r\n\r\n40:6 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and\r\nwent up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate,\r\nwhich was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which\r\nwas one reed broad.\r\n\r\n40:7 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;\r\nand between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of\r\nthe gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.\r\n\r\n40:8 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.\r\n\r\n40:9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the\r\nposts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.\r\n\r\n40:10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this\r\nside, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the\r\nposts had one measure on this side and on that side.\r\n\r\n40:11 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten\r\ncubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.\r\n\r\n40:12 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this\r\nside, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little\r\nchambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.\r\n\r\n40:13 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to\r\nthe roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door\r\nagainst door.\r\n\r\n40:14 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of\r\nthe court round about the gate.\r\n\r\n40:15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of\r\nthe porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.\r\n\r\n40:16 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to\r\ntheir posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches:\r\nand windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n40:17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were\r\nchambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty\r\nchambers were upon the pavement.\r\n\r\n40:18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the\r\nlength of the gates was the lower pavement.\r\n\r\n40:19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower\r\ngate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits\r\neastward and northward.\r\n\r\n40:20 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north,\r\nhe measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.\r\n\r\n40:21 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and\r\nthree on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were\r\nafter the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty\r\ncubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.\r\n\r\n40:22 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were\r\nafter the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they\r\nwent up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n40:23 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward\r\nthe north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an\r\nhundred cubits.\r\n\r\n40:24 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate\r\ntoward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches\r\nthereof according to these measures.\r\n\r\n40:25 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round\r\nabout, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the\r\nbreadth five and twenty cubits.\r\n\r\n40:26 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches\r\nthereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and\r\nanother on that side, upon the posts thereof.\r\n\r\n40:27 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he\r\nmeasured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n40:28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he\r\nmeasured the south gate according to these measures; 40:29 And the\r\nlittle chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches\r\nthereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and\r\nin the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five\r\nand twenty cubits broad.\r\n\r\n40:30 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and\r\nfive cubits broad.\r\n\r\n40:31 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm\r\ntrees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n40:32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he\r\nmeasured the gate according to these measures.\r\n\r\n40:33 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the\r\narches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were\r\nwindows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty\r\ncubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.\r\n\r\n40:34 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm\r\ntrees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and\r\nthe going up to it had eight steps.\r\n\r\n40:35 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according\r\nto these measures; 40:36 The little chambers thereof, the posts\r\nthereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about:\r\nthe length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.\r\n\r\n40:37 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm\r\ntrees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and\r\nthe going up to it had eight steps.\r\n\r\n40:38 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of\r\nthe gates, where they washed the burnt offering.\r\n\r\n40:39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and\r\ntwo tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the\r\nsin offering and the trespass offering.\r\n\r\n40:40 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the\r\nnorth gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the\r\nporch of the gate, were two tables.\r\n\r\n40:41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by\r\nthe side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n40:42 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,\r\nof a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one\r\ncubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they\r\nslew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n40:43 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and\r\nupon the tables was the flesh of the offering.\r\n\r\n40:44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in\r\nthe inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their\r\nprospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having\r\nthe prospect toward the north.\r\n\r\n40:45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the\r\nsouth, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.\r\n\r\n40:46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the\r\npriests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of\r\nZadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\n40:47 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred\r\ncubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.\r\n\r\n40:48 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each\r\npost of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that\r\nside: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and\r\nthree cubits on that side.\r\n\r\n40:49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth\r\neleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to\r\nit: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another\r\non that side.\r\n\r\n41:1 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,\r\nsix cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other\r\nside, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n41:2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the\r\ndoor were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other\r\nside: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the\r\nbreadth, twenty cubits.\r\n\r\n41:3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two\r\ncubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven\r\ncubits.\r\n\r\n41:4 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the\r\nbreadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This\r\nis the most holy place.\r\n\r\n41:5 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the\r\nbreadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on\r\nevery side.\r\n\r\n41:6 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in\r\norder; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the\r\nside chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not\r\nhold in the wall of the house.\r\n\r\n41:7 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to\r\nthe side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still\r\nupward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was\r\nstill upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest\r\nby the midst.\r\n\r\n41:8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations\r\nof the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.\r\n\r\n41:9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber\r\nwithout, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the\r\nside chambers that were within.\r\n\r\n41:10 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round\r\nabout the house on every side.\r\n\r\n41:11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that\r\nwas left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the\r\nsouth: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits\r\nround about.\r\n\r\n41:12 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end\r\ntoward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building\r\nwas five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety\r\ncubits.\r\n\r\n41:13 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the\r\nseparate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred\r\ncubits long; 41:14 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of\r\nthe separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n41:15 And he measured the length of the building over against the\r\nseparate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the\r\none side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner\r\ntemple, and the porches of the court; 41:16 The door posts, and the\r\nnarrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories,\r\nover against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the\r\nground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; 41:17 To that\r\nabove the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the\r\nwall round about within and without, by measure.\r\n\r\n41:18 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm\r\ntree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two\r\nfaces; 41:19 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the\r\none side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the\r\nother side: it was made through all the house round about.\r\n\r\n41:20 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm\r\ntrees made, and on the wall of the temple.\r\n\r\n41:21 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the\r\nsanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.\r\n\r\n41:22 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof\r\ntwo cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the\r\nwalls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table\r\nthat is before the LORD.\r\n\r\n41:23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.\r\n\r\n41:24 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two\r\nleaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.\r\n\r\n41:25 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,\r\ncherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there\r\nwere thick planks upon the face of the porch without.\r\n\r\n41:26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and\r\non the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side\r\nchambers of the house, and thick planks.\r\n\r\n42:1 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the\r\nnorth: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the\r\nseparate place, and which was before the building toward the north.\r\n\r\n42:2 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and\r\nthe breadth was fifty cubits.\r\n\r\n42:3 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,\r\nand over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was\r\ngallery against gallery in three stories.\r\n\r\n42:4 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward,\r\na way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.\r\n\r\n42:5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were\r\nhigher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n42:6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the\r\npillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than\r\nthe lowest and the middlemost from the ground.\r\n\r\n42:7 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward\r\nthe utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof\r\nwas fifty cubits.\r\n\r\n42:8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was\r\nfifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n42:9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as\r\none goeth into them from the utter court.\r\n\r\n42:10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court\r\ntoward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n42:11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers\r\nwhich were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they:\r\nand all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and\r\naccording to their doors.\r\n\r\n42:12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the\r\nsouth was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before\r\nthe wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.\r\n\r\n42:13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,\r\nwhich are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the\r\npriests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things:\r\nthere shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and\r\nthe sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.\r\n\r\n42:14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of\r\nthe holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their\r\ngarments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on\r\nother garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n42:15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he\r\nbrought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east,\r\nand measured it round about.\r\n\r\n42:16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred\r\nreeds, with the measuring reed round about.\r\n\r\n42:17 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the\r\nmeasuring reed round about.\r\n\r\n42:18 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the\r\nmeasuring reed.\r\n\r\n42:19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred\r\nreeds with the measuring reed.\r\n\r\n42:20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,\r\nfive hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation\r\nbetween the sanctuary and the profane place.\r\n\r\n43:1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh\r\ntoward the east: 43:2 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came\r\nfrom the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many\r\nwaters: and the earth shined with his glory.\r\n\r\n43:3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,\r\neven according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the\r\ncity: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river\r\nChebar; and I fell upon my face.\r\n\r\n43:4 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the\r\ngate whose prospect is toward the east.\r\n\r\n43:5 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;\r\nand, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.\r\n\r\n43:6 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man\r\nstood by me.\r\n\r\n43:7 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the\r\nplace of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the\r\nchildren of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of\r\nIsrael no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their\r\nwhoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.\r\n\r\n43:8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their\r\npost by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even\r\ndefiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed:\r\nwherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.\r\n\r\n43:9 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their\r\nkings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.\r\n\r\n43:10 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that\r\nthey may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the\r\npattern.\r\n\r\n43:11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the\r\nform of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out\r\nthereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and\r\nall the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the\r\nlaws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the\r\nwhole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.\r\n\r\n43:12 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the\r\nwhole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is\r\nthe law of the house.\r\n\r\n43:13 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The\r\ncubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a\r\ncubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge\r\nthereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher\r\nplace of the altar.\r\n\r\n43:14 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle\r\nshall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser\r\nsettle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the\r\nbreadth one cubit.\r\n\r\n43:15 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward\r\nshall be four horns.\r\n\r\n43:16 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square\r\nin the four squares thereof.\r\n\r\n43:17 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad\r\nin the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a\r\ncubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs\r\nshall look toward the east.\r\n\r\n43:18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These\r\nare the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to\r\noffer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.\r\n\r\n43:19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the\r\nseed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the\r\nLord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.\r\n\r\n43:20 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four\r\nhorns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the\r\nborder round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.\r\n\r\n43:21 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he\r\nshall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n43:22 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats\r\nwithout blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar,\r\nas they did cleanse it with the bullock.\r\n\r\n43:23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a\r\nyoung bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without\r\nblemish.\r\n\r\n43:24 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall\r\ncast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering\r\nunto the LORD.\r\n\r\n43:25 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin\r\noffering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of\r\nthe flock, without blemish.\r\n\r\n43:26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they\r\nshall consecrate themselves.\r\n\r\n43:27 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the\r\neighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt\r\nofferings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept\r\nyou, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n44:1 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward\r\nsanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.\r\n\r\n44:2 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not\r\nbe opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God\r\nof Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.\r\n\r\n44:3 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread\r\nbefore the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate,\r\nand shall go out by the way of the same.\r\n\r\n44:4 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:\r\nand I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of\r\nthe LORD: and I fell upon my face.\r\n\r\n44:5 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with\r\nthine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee\r\nconcerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the\r\nlaws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every\r\ngoing forth of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n44:6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of\r\nIsrael, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice\r\nyou of all your abominations, 44:7 In that ye have brought into my\r\nsanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in\r\nflesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye\r\noffer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my\r\ncovenant because of all your abominations.\r\n\r\n44:8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have\r\nset keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.\r\n\r\n44:9 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor\r\nuncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger\r\nthat is among the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n44:10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went\r\nastray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall\r\neven bear their iniquity.\r\n\r\n44:11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at\r\nthe gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay\r\nthe burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall\r\nstand before them to minister unto them.\r\n\r\n44:12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused\r\nthe house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up\r\nmine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n44:13 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a\r\npriest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most\r\nholy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations\r\nwhich they have committed.\r\n\r\n44:14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all\r\nthe service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.\r\n\r\n44:15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the\r\ncharge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from\r\nme, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall\r\nstand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord\r\nGOD: 44:16 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come\r\nnear to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.\r\n\r\n44:17 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates\r\nof the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no\r\nwool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the\r\ninner court, and within.\r\n\r\n44:18 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have\r\nlinen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with\r\nany thing that causeth sweat.\r\n\r\n44:19 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter\r\ncourt to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they\r\nministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on\r\nother garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\n44:20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to\r\ngrow long; they shall only poll their heads.\r\n\r\n44:21 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the\r\ninner court.\r\n\r\n44:22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is\r\nput away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of\r\nIsrael, or a widow that had a priest before.\r\n\r\n44:23 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy\r\nand profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n44:24 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall\r\njudge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my\r\nstatutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.\r\n\r\n44:25 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but\r\nfor father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother,\r\nor for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.\r\n\r\n44:26 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.\r\n\r\n44:27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner\r\ncourt, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,\r\nsaith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n44:28 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their\r\ninheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am\r\ntheir possession.\r\n\r\n44:29 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the\r\ntrespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n44:30 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every\r\noblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough,\r\nthat he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.\r\n\r\n44:31 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,\r\nor torn, whether it be fowl or beast.\r\n\r\n45:1 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,\r\nye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land:\r\nthe length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and\r\nthe breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the\r\nborders thereof round about.\r\n\r\n45:2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length,\r\nwith five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits\r\nround about for the suburbs thereof.\r\n\r\n45:3 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and\r\ntwenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be\r\nthe sanctuary and the most holy place.\r\n\r\n45:4 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the\r\nministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the\r\nLORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for\r\nthe sanctuary.\r\n\r\n45:5 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand\r\nof breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have\r\nfor themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.\r\n\r\n45:6 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand\r\nbroad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of\r\nthe holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.\r\n\r\n45:7 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the\r\nother side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession\r\nof the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the\r\npossession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east\r\nside eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the\r\nportions, from the west border unto the east border.\r\n\r\n45:8 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes\r\nshall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they\r\ngive to the house of Israel according to their tribes.\r\n\r\n45:9 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel:\r\nremove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away\r\nyour exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n45:10 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.\r\n\r\n45:11 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath\r\nmay contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part\r\nof an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.\r\n\r\n45:12 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and\r\ntwenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.\r\n\r\n45:13 This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an\r\nephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an\r\nephah of an homer of barley: 45:14 Concerning the ordinance of oil,\r\nthe bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the\r\ncor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer: 45:15\r\nAnd one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat\r\npastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and\r\nfor peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n45:16 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the\r\nprince in Israel.\r\n\r\n45:17 And it shall be the prince\xe2\x80\x99s part to give burnt offerings, and\r\nmeat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new\r\nmoons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel:\r\nhe shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the\r\nburnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for\r\nthe house of Israel.\r\n\r\n45:18 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of\r\nthe month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and\r\ncleanse the sanctuary: 45:19 And the priest shall take of the blood of\r\nthe sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the\r\nfour corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the\r\ngate of the inner court.\r\n\r\n45:20 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one\r\nthat erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n45:21 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall\r\nhave the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n45:22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for\r\nall the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.\r\n\r\n45:23 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to\r\nthe LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the\r\nseven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.\r\n\r\n45:24 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock,\r\nand an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.\r\n\r\n45:25 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall\r\nhe do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin\r\noffering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat\r\noffering, and according to the oil.\r\n\r\n46:1 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh\r\ntoward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath\r\nit shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.\r\n\r\n46:2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate\r\nwithout, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests\r\nshall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall\r\nworship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the\r\ngate shall not be shut until the evening.\r\n\r\n46:3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this\r\ngate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.\r\n\r\n46:4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD\r\nin the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram\r\nwithout blemish.\r\n\r\n46:5 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat\r\noffering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil\r\nto an ephah.\r\n\r\n46:6 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock\r\nwithout blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without\r\nblemish.\r\n\r\n46:7 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and\r\nan ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall\r\nattain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.\r\n\r\n46:8 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the\r\nporch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.\r\n\r\n46:9 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the\r\nsolemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to\r\nworship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that\r\nentereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the\r\nnorth gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came\r\nin, but shall go forth over against it.\r\n\r\n46:10 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go\r\nin; and when they go forth, shall go forth.\r\n\r\n46:11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall\r\nbe an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as\r\nhe is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.\r\n\r\n46:12 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or\r\npeace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the\r\ngate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt\r\noffering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then\r\nhe shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.\r\n\r\n46:13 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a\r\nlamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n46:14 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the\r\nsixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper\r\nwith the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual\r\nordinance unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n46:15 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the\r\noil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.\r\n\r\n46:16 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of\r\nhis sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons\xe2\x80\x99; it shall be\r\ntheir possession by inheritance.\r\n\r\n46:17 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,\r\nthen it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to\r\nthe prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons\xe2\x80\x99 for them.\r\n\r\n46:18 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance\r\nby oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall\r\ngive his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be\r\nnot scattered every man from his possession.\r\n\r\n46:19 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of\r\nthe gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward\r\nthe north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.\r\n\r\n46:20 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall\r\nboil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake\r\nthe meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court,\r\nto sanctify the people.\r\n\r\n46:21 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to\r\npass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of\r\nthe court there was a court.\r\n\r\n46:22 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of\r\nforty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n46:23 And there was a row of building round about in them, round about\r\nthem four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n46:24 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,\r\nwhere the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n47:1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,\r\nbehold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house\r\neastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and\r\nthe waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at\r\nthe south side of the altar.\r\n\r\n47:2 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led\r\nme about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh\r\neastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.\r\n\r\n47:3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth\r\neastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the\r\nwaters; the waters were to the ankles.\r\n\r\n47:4 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters;\r\nthe waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and\r\nbrought me through; the waters were to the loins.\r\n\r\n47:5 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could\r\nnot pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river\r\nthat could not be passed over.\r\n\r\n47:6 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he\r\nbrought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.\r\n\r\n47:7 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were\r\nvery many trees on the one side and on the other.\r\n\r\n47:8 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east\r\ncountry, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being\r\nbrought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.\r\n\r\n47:9 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which\r\nmoveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there\r\nshall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall\r\ncome thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live\r\nwhither the river cometh.\r\n\r\n47:10 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it\r\nfrom Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth\r\nnets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the\r\ngreat sea, exceeding many.\r\n\r\n47:11 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not\r\nbe healed; they shall be given to salt.\r\n\r\n47:12 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that\r\nside, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade,\r\nneither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new\r\nfruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of\r\nthe sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf\r\nthereof for medicine.\r\n\r\n47:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye\r\nshall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:\r\nJoseph shall have two portions.\r\n\r\n47:14 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the\r\nwhich I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this\r\nland shall fall unto you for inheritance.\r\n\r\n47:15 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side,\r\nfrom the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; 47:16\r\nHamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and\r\nthe border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.\r\n\r\n47:17 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of\r\nDamascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this\r\nis the north side.\r\n\r\n47:18 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from\r\nDamascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from\r\nthe border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.\r\n\r\n47:19 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of\r\nstrife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south\r\nside southward.\r\n\r\n47:20 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till\r\na man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.\r\n\r\n47:21 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n47:22 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an\r\ninheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you,\r\nwhich shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as\r\nborn in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have\r\ninheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n47:23 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger\r\nsojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n48:1 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the\r\ncoast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the\r\nborder of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are\r\nhis sides east and west; a portion for Dan.\r\n\r\n48:2 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side,\r\na portion for Asher.\r\n\r\n48:3 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west\r\nside, a portion for Naphtali.\r\n\r\n48:4 And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, a portion for Manasseh.\r\n\r\n48:5 And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, a portion for Ephraim.\r\n\r\n48:6 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the\r\nwest side, a portion for Reuben.\r\n\r\n48:7 And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, a portion for Judah.\r\n\r\n48:8 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty\r\nthousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts,\r\nfrom the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in\r\nthe midst of it.\r\n\r\n48:9 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five\r\nand twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.\r\n\r\n48:10 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation;\r\ntoward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the\r\nwest ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in\r\nbreadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and\r\nthe sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.\r\n\r\n48:11 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of\r\nZadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the\r\nchildren of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.\r\n\r\n48:12 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them\r\na thing most holy by the border of the Levites.\r\n\r\n48:13 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall\r\nhave five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth:\r\nall the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n48:14 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate\r\nthe firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.\r\n\r\n48:15 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against\r\nthe five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city,\r\nfor dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n48:16 And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four\r\nthousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five\r\nhundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the\r\nwest side four thousand and five hundred.\r\n\r\n48:17 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two\r\nhundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and\r\ntoward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred\r\nand fifty.\r\n\r\n48:18 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy\r\nportion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and\r\nit shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the\r\nincrease thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city.\r\n\r\n48:19 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the\r\ntribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n48:20 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and\r\ntwenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the\r\npossession of the city.\r\n\r\n48:21 And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on\r\nthe other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city,\r\nover against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the\r\neast border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand\r\ntoward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and\r\nit shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be\r\nin the midst thereof.\r\n\r\n48:22 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the\r\npossession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the\r\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin,\r\nshall be for the prince.\r\n\r\n48:23 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, Benjamin shall have a portion.\r\n\r\n48:24 And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, Simeon shall have a portion.\r\n\r\n48:25 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, Issachar a portion.\r\n\r\n48:26 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, Zebulun a portion.\r\n\r\n48:27 And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west\r\nside, Gad a portion.\r\n\r\n48:28 And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the\r\nborder shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh,\r\nand to the river toward the great sea.\r\n\r\n48:29 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of\r\nIsrael for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n48:30 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four\r\nthousand and five hundred measures.\r\n\r\n48:31 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes\r\nof Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of\r\nJudah, one gate of Levi.\r\n\r\n48:32 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three\r\ngates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.\r\n\r\n48:33 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:\r\nand three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of\r\nZebulun.\r\n\r\n48:34 At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their\r\nthree gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.\r\n\r\n48:35 It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of\r\nthe city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Daniel\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came\r\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.\r\n\r\n1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part\r\nof the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of\r\nShinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the\r\ntreasure house of his god.\r\n\r\n1:3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that\r\nhe should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseed, and of the princes; 1:4 Children in whom was no blemish, but\r\nwell favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge,\r\nand understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the\r\ntongue of the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\n1:5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king\xe2\x80\x99s meat,\r\nand of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that\r\nat the end thereof they might stand before the king.\r\n\r\n1:6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,\r\nMishael, and Azariah: 1:7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave\r\nnames: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to\r\nHananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of\r\nAbednego.\r\n\r\n1:8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself\r\nwith the portion of the king\xe2\x80\x99s meat, nor with the wine which he drank:\r\ntherefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not\r\ndefile himself.\r\n\r\n1:9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the\r\nprince of the eunuchs.\r\n\r\n1:10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord\r\nthe king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should\r\nhe see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your\r\nsort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.\r\n\r\n1:11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had\r\nset over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 1:12 Prove thy\r\nservants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat,\r\nand water to drink.\r\n\r\n1:13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the\r\ncountenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmeat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.\r\n\r\n1:14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.\r\n\r\n1:15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and\r\nfatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s meat.\r\n\r\n1:16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine\r\nthat they should drink; and gave them pulse.\r\n\r\n1:17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in\r\nall learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions\r\nand dreams.\r\n\r\n1:18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring\r\nthem in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before\r\nNebuchadnezzar.\r\n\r\n1:19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found\r\nnone like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they\r\nbefore the king.\r\n\r\n1:20 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king\r\nenquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the\r\nmagicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.\r\n\r\n1:21 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.\r\n\r\n2:1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar\r\nNebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and\r\nhis sleep brake from him.\r\n\r\n2:2 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the\r\nastrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the\r\nking his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.\r\n\r\n2:3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit\r\nwas troubled to know the dream.\r\n\r\n2:4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for\r\never: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n2:5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone\r\nfrom me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the\r\ninterpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses\r\nshall be made a dunghill.\r\n\r\n2:6 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall\r\nreceive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me\r\nthe dream, and the interpretation thereof.\r\n\r\n2:7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the\r\ndream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.\r\n\r\n2:8 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain\r\nthe time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.\r\n\r\n2:9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one\r\ndecree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak\r\nbefore me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and\r\nI shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.\r\n\r\n2:10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a\r\nman upon the earth that can shew the king\xe2\x80\x99s matter: therefore there is\r\nno king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or\r\nastrologer, or Chaldean.\r\n\r\n2:11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none\r\nother that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose\r\ndwelling is not with flesh.\r\n\r\n2:12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded\r\nto destroy all the wise men of Babylon.\r\n\r\n2:13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and\r\nthey sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.\r\n\r\n2:14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the\r\ncaptain of the king\xe2\x80\x99s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men\r\nof Babylon: 2:15 He answered and said to Arioch the king\xe2\x80\x99s captain,\r\nWhy is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing\r\nknown to Daniel.\r\n\r\n2:16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give\r\nhim time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.\r\n\r\n2:17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to\r\nHananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 2:18 That they would\r\ndesire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that\r\nDaniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men\r\nof Babylon.\r\n\r\n2:19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then\r\nDaniel blessed the God of heaven.\r\n\r\n2:20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and\r\never: for wisdom and might are his: 2:21 And he changeth the times and\r\nthe seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom\r\nunto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: 2:22 He\r\nrevealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the\r\ndarkness, and the light dwelleth with him.\r\n\r\n2:23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast\r\ngiven me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we\r\ndesired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n2:24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained\r\nto destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him;\r\nDestroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and\r\nI will shew unto the king the interpretation.\r\n\r\n2:25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said\r\nthus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will\r\nmake known unto the king the interpretation.\r\n\r\n2:26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was\r\nBelteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I\r\nhave seen, and the interpretation thereof?  2:27 Daniel answered in\r\nthe presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath\r\ndemanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the\r\nsoothsayers, shew unto the king; 2:28 But there is a God in heaven\r\nthat revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar\r\nwhat shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy\r\nhead upon thy bed, are these; 2:29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts\r\ncame into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter:\r\nand he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to\r\npass.\r\n\r\n2:30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom\r\nthat I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make\r\nknown the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the\r\nthoughts of thy heart.\r\n\r\n2:31 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,\r\nwhose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form\r\nthereof was terrible.\r\n\r\n2:32 This image\xe2\x80\x99s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of\r\nsilver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 2:33 His legs of iron, his\r\nfeet part of iron and part of clay.\r\n\r\n2:34 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which\r\nsmote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake\r\nthem to pieces.\r\n\r\n2:35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,\r\nbroken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer\r\nthreshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was\r\nfound for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great\r\nmountain, and filled the whole earth.\r\n\r\n2:36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof\r\nbefore the king.\r\n\r\n2:37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath\r\ngiven thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.\r\n\r\n2:38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the\r\nfield and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and\r\nhath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.\r\n\r\n2:39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and\r\nanother third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n2:40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron\r\nbreaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh\r\nall these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.\r\n\r\n2:41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters\xe2\x80\x99 clay,\r\nand part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in\r\nit of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron\r\nmixed with miry clay.\r\n\r\n2:42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,\r\nso the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.\r\n\r\n2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall\r\nmingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one\r\nto another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.\r\n\r\n2:44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a\r\nkingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be\r\nleft to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all\r\nthese kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.\r\n\r\n2:45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the\r\nmountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the\r\nbrass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made\r\nknown to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is\r\ncertain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\r\n\r\n2:46 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped\r\nDaniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet\r\nodours unto him.\r\n\r\n2:47 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that\r\nyour God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of\r\nsecrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.\r\n\r\n2:48 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great\r\ngifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and\r\nchief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.\r\n\r\n2:49 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach,\r\nand Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel\r\nsat in the gate of the king.\r\n\r\n3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was\r\nthreescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in\r\nthe plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.\r\n\r\n3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes,\r\nthe governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the\r\ncounsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to\r\ncome to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had\r\nset up.\r\n\r\n3:3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the\r\ntreasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the\r\nprovinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image\r\nthat Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the\r\nimage that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\r\n\r\n3:4 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,\r\nnations, and languages, 3:5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the\r\ncornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of\r\nmusick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar\r\nthe king hath set up: 3:6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth\r\nshall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.\r\n\r\n3:7 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the\r\ncornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all\r\nthe people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped\r\nthe golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\r\n\r\n3:8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused\r\nthe Jews.\r\n\r\n3:9 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for\r\never.\r\n\r\n3:10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear\r\nthe sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer,\r\nand all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:\r\n3:11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be\r\ncast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.\r\n\r\n3:12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the\r\nprovince of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O\r\nking, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the\r\ngolden image which thou hast set up.\r\n\r\n3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring\r\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\n3:14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,\r\nMeshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden\r\nimage which I have set up?  3:15 Now if ye be ready that at what time\r\nye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and\r\ndulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image\r\nwhich I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the\r\nsame hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that\r\nGod that shall deliver you out of my hands?  3:16 Shadrach, Meshach,\r\nand Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are\r\nnot careful to answer thee in this matter.\r\n\r\n3:17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the\r\nburning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O\r\nking.\r\n\r\n3:18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve\r\nthy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.\r\n\r\n3:19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage\r\nwas changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he\r\nspake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times\r\nmore than it was wont to be heated.\r\n\r\n3:20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to\r\nbind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the\r\nburning fiery furnace.\r\n\r\n3:21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their\r\nhats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the\r\nburning fiery furnace.\r\n\r\n3:22 Therefore because the king\xe2\x80\x99s commandment was urgent, and the\r\nfurnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took\r\nup Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\r\n\r\n3:23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down\r\nbound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.\r\n\r\n3:24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,\r\nand spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men\r\nbound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the\r\nking, True, O king.\r\n\r\n3:25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the\r\nmidst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth\r\nis like the Son of God.\r\n\r\n3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery\r\nfurnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye\r\nservants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then\r\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.\r\n\r\n3:27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies\r\nthe fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither\r\nwere their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.\r\n\r\n3:28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of\r\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and\r\ndelivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor\r\nworship any god, except their own God.\r\n\r\n3:29 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and\r\nlanguage, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach,\r\nMeshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall\r\nbe made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver\r\nafter this sort.\r\n\r\n3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the\r\nprovince of Babylon.\r\n\r\n4:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,\r\nthat dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.\r\n\r\n4:2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God\r\nhath wrought toward me.\r\n\r\n4:3 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his\r\nkingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation\r\nto generation.\r\n\r\n4:4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my\r\npalace: 4:5 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon\r\nmy bed and the visions of my head troubled me.\r\n\r\n4:6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon\r\nbefore me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\n4:7 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and\r\nthe soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not\r\nmake known unto me the interpretation thereof.\r\n\r\n4:8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was\r\nBelteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the\r\nspirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, 4:9\r\nO Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the\r\nspirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell\r\nme the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n4:10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a\r\ntree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.\r\n\r\n4:11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached\r\nunto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 4:12\r\nThe leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it\r\nwas meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the\r\nfowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a\r\nwatcher and an holy one came down from heaven; 4:14 He cried aloud,\r\nand said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off\r\nhis leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under\r\nit, and the fowls from his branches: 4:15 Nevertheless leave the stump\r\nof his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the\r\ntender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven,\r\nand let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 4:16\r\nLet his heart be changed from man\xe2\x80\x99s, and let a beast\xe2\x80\x99s heart be given\r\nunto him; and let seven times pass over him.\r\n\r\n4:17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by\r\nthe word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that\r\nthe most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to\r\nwhomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.\r\n\r\n4:18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O\r\nBelteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the\r\nwise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the\r\ninterpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is\r\nin thee.\r\n\r\n4:19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one\r\nhour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,\r\nBelteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof,\r\ntrouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to\r\nthem that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.\r\n\r\n4:20 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose\r\nheight reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the\r\nearth; 4:21 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in\r\nit was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and\r\nupon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 4:22\r\nIt is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy\r\ngreatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the\r\nend of the earth.\r\n\r\n4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down\r\nfrom heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave\r\nthe stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron\r\nand brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with\r\nthe dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the\r\nfield, till seven times pass over him; 4:24 This is the\r\ninterpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which\r\nis come upon my lord the king: 4:25 That they shall drive thee from\r\nmen, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they\r\nshall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the\r\ndew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know\r\nthat the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to\r\nwhomsoever he will.\r\n\r\n4:26 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots;\r\nthy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known\r\nthat the heavens do rule.\r\n\r\n4:27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and\r\nbreak off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing\r\nmercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.\r\n\r\n4:28 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.\r\n\r\n4:29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the\r\nkingdom of Babylon.\r\n\r\n4:30 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have\r\nbuilt for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for\r\nthe honour of my majesty?  4:31 While the word was in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar,\r\nto thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.\r\n\r\n4:32 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be\r\nwith the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as\r\noxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the\r\nmost High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n4:33 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he\r\nwas driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet\r\nwith the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeathers, and his nails like birds\xe2\x80\x99 claws.\r\n\r\n4:34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes\r\nunto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed\r\nthe most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,\r\nwhose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from\r\ngeneration to generation: 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the earth\r\nare reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army\r\nof heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay\r\nhis hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  4:36 At the same time my\r\nreason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour\r\nand brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords\r\nsought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent\r\nmajesty was added unto me.\r\n\r\n4:37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of\r\nheaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those\r\nthat walk in pride he is able to abase.\r\n\r\n5:1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,\r\nand drank wine before the thousand.\r\n\r\n5:2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the\r\ngolden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken\r\nout of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his\r\nprinces, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.\r\n\r\n5:3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the\r\ntemple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and\r\nhis princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.\r\n\r\n5:4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of\r\nbrass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.\r\n\r\n5:5 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and wrote\r\nover against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.\r\n\r\n5:6 Then the king\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled\r\nhim, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote\r\none against another.\r\n\r\n5:7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,\r\nand the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of\r\nBabylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the\r\ninterpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a\r\nchain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n5:8 Then came in all the king\xe2\x80\x99s wise men: but they could not read the\r\nwriting, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.\r\n\r\n5:9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was\r\nchanged in him, and his lords were astonied.\r\n\r\n5:10 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords\r\ncame into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king,\r\nlive for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy\r\ncountenance be changed: 5:11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is\r\nthe spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and\r\nunderstanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in\r\nhim; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy\r\nfather, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and\r\nsoothsayers; 5:12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and\r\nunderstanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences,\r\nand dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king\r\nnamed Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n5:13 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake\r\nand said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children\r\nof the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of\r\nJewry?  5:14 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is\r\nin thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is\r\nfound in thee.\r\n\r\n5:15 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in\r\nbefore me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me\r\nthe interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation\r\nof the thing: 5:16 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make\r\ninterpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the\r\nwriting, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt\r\nbe clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and\r\nshalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n5:17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be\r\nto thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the\r\nwriting unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.\r\n\r\n5:18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a\r\nkingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 5:19 And for the majesty\r\nthat he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and\r\nfeared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept\r\nalive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.\r\n\r\n5:20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,\r\nhe was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from\r\nhim: 5:21 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was\r\nmade like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they\r\nfed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of\r\nheaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of\r\nmen, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.\r\n\r\n5:22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,\r\nthough thou knewest all this; 5:23 But hast lifted up thyself against\r\nthe Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house\r\nbefore thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines,\r\nhave drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and\r\ngold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor\r\nknow: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy\r\nways, hast thou not glorified: 5:24 Then was the part of the hand sent\r\nfrom him; and this writing was written.\r\n\r\n5:25 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,\r\nUPHARSIN.\r\n\r\n5:26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered\r\nthy kingdom, and finished it.\r\n\r\n5:27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.\r\n\r\n5:28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n5:29 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,\r\nand put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation\r\nconcerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n5:30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.\r\n\r\n5:31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore\r\nand two years old.\r\n\r\n6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty\r\nprinces, which should be over the whole kingdom; 6:2 And over these\r\nthree presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might\r\ngive accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.\r\n\r\n6:3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,\r\nbecause an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set\r\nhim over the whole realm.\r\n\r\n6:4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against\r\nDaniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor\r\nfault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or\r\nfault found in him.\r\n\r\n6:5 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this\r\nDaniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.\r\n\r\n6:6 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king,\r\nand said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.\r\n\r\n6:7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,\r\nthe counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to\r\nestablish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever\r\nshall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee,\r\nO king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.\r\n\r\n6:8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it\r\nbe not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which\r\naltereth not.\r\n\r\n6:9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.\r\n\r\n6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into\r\nhis house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,\r\nhe kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave\r\nthanks before his God, as he did aforetime.\r\n\r\n6:11 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making\r\nsupplication before his God.\r\n\r\n6:12 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that\r\nshall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of\r\nthee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered\r\nand said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and\r\nPersians, which altereth not.\r\n\r\n6:13 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which\r\nis of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O\r\nking, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition\r\nthree times a day.\r\n\r\n6:14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased\r\nwith himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he\r\nlaboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.\r\n\r\n6:15 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,\r\nKnow, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no\r\ndecree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.\r\n\r\n6:16 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him\r\ninto the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy\r\nGod whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.\r\n\r\n6:17 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and\r\nthe king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his\r\nlords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.\r\n\r\n6:18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:\r\nneither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep\r\nwent from him.\r\n\r\n6:19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste\r\nunto the den of lions.\r\n\r\n6:20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice\r\nunto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant\r\nof the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to\r\ndeliver thee from the lions?  6:21 Then said Daniel unto the king, O\r\nking, live for ever.\r\n\r\n6:22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions\xe2\x80\x99 mouths, that\r\nthey have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in\r\nme; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.\r\n\r\n6:23 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that\r\nthey should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out\r\nof the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he\r\nbelieved in his God.\r\n\r\n6:24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had\r\naccused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their\r\nchildren, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and\r\nbrake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the\r\nden.\r\n\r\n6:25 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,\r\nthat dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.\r\n\r\n6:26 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble\r\nand fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and\r\nstedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,\r\nand his dominion shall be even unto the end.\r\n\r\n6:27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in\r\nheaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the\r\nlions.\r\n\r\n6:28 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign\r\nof Cyrus the Persian.\r\n\r\n7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream\r\nand visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and\r\ntold the sum of the matters.\r\n\r\n7:2 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,\r\nthe four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.\r\n\r\n7:3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n7:4 The first was like a lion, and had eagle\xe2\x80\x99s wings: I beheld till\r\nthe wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth,\r\nand made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart was given to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n7:5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised\r\nup itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it\r\nbetween the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour\r\nmuch flesh.\r\n\r\n7:6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had\r\nupon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four\r\nheads; and dominion was given to it.\r\n\r\n7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,\r\ndreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron\r\nteeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with\r\nthe feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were\r\nbefore it; and it had ten horns.\r\n\r\n7:8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them\r\nanother little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns\r\nplucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the\r\neyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.\r\n\r\n7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days\r\ndid sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head\r\nlike the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his\r\nwheels as burning fire.\r\n\r\n7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand\r\nthousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand\r\nstood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.\r\n\r\n7:11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the\r\nhorn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body\r\ndestroyed, and given to the burning flame.\r\n\r\n7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion\r\ntaken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.\r\n\r\n7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man\r\ncame with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and\r\nthey brought him near before him.\r\n\r\n7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that\r\nall people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is\r\nan everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom\r\nthat which shall not be destroyed.\r\n\r\n7:15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and\r\nthe visions of my head troubled me.\r\n\r\n7:16 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the\r\ntruth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation\r\nof the things.\r\n\r\n7:17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall\r\narise out of the earth.\r\n\r\n7:18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and\r\npossess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n7:19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was\r\ndiverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of\r\niron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and\r\nstamped the residue with his feet; 7:20 And of the ten horns that were\r\nin his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three\r\nfell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very\r\ngreat things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.\r\n\r\n7:21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and\r\nprevailed against them; 7:22 Until the Ancient of days came, and\r\njudgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came\r\nthat the saints possessed the kingdom.\r\n\r\n7:23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon\r\nearth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the\r\nwhole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.\r\n\r\n7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall\r\narise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from\r\nthe first, and he shall subdue three kings.\r\n\r\n7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall\r\nwear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and\r\nlaws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and\r\nthe dividing of time.\r\n\r\n7:26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his\r\ndominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.\r\n\r\n7:27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom\r\nunder the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of\r\nthe most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all\r\ndominions shall serve and obey him.\r\n\r\n7:28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my\r\ncogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I\r\nkept the matter in my heart.\r\n\r\n8:1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision\r\nappeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto\r\nme at the first.\r\n\r\n8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was\r\nat Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw\r\nin a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.\r\n\r\n8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood\r\nbefore the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were\r\nhigh; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.\r\n\r\n8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so\r\nthat no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that\r\ncould deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and\r\nbecame great.\r\n\r\n8:5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on\r\nthe face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat\r\nhad a notable horn between his eyes.\r\n\r\n8:6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen\r\nstanding before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.\r\n\r\n8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with\r\ncholer against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and\r\nthere was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him\r\ndown to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that\r\ncould deliver the ram out of his hand.\r\n\r\n8:8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,\r\nthe great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward\r\nthe four winds of heaven.\r\n\r\n8:9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed\r\nexceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the\r\npleasant land.\r\n\r\n8:10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down\r\nsome of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n8:11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by\r\nhim the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary\r\nwas cast down.\r\n\r\n8:12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason\r\nof transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it\r\npractised, and prospered.\r\n\r\n8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that\r\ncertain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the\r\ndaily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the\r\nsanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?  8:14 And he said\r\nunto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the\r\nsanctuary be cleansed.\r\n\r\n8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,\r\nand sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the\r\nappearance of a man.\r\n\r\n8:16 And I heard a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice between the banks of Ulai, which\r\ncalled, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.\r\n\r\n8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,\r\nand fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man:\r\nfor at the time of the end shall be the vision.\r\n\r\n8:18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face\r\ntoward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.\r\n\r\n8:19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the\r\nlast end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n8:20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media\r\nand Persia.\r\n\r\n8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that\r\nis between his eyes is the first king.\r\n\r\n8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four\r\nkingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.\r\n\r\n8:23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors\r\nare come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding\r\ndark sentences, shall stand up.\r\n\r\n8:24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he\r\nshall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall\r\ndestroy the mighty and the holy people.\r\n\r\n8:25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in\r\nhis hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace\r\nshall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of\r\nprinces; but he shall be broken without hand.\r\n\r\n8:26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is\r\ntrue: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose\r\nup, and did the king\xe2\x80\x99s business; and I was astonished at the vision,\r\nbut none understood it.\r\n\r\n9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of\r\nthe Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 9:2 In\r\nthe first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of\r\nthe years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet,\r\nthat he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n9:3 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and\r\nsupplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 9:4 And I\r\nprayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord,\r\nthe great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them\r\nthat love him, and to them that keep his commandments; 9:5 We have\r\nsinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have\r\nrebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:\r\n9:6 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which\r\nspake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to\r\nall the people of the land.\r\n\r\n9:7 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion\r\nof faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants\r\nof Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far\r\noff, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because\r\nof their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.\r\n\r\n9:8 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our\r\nprinces, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.\r\n\r\n9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we\r\nhave rebelled against him; 9:10 Neither have we obeyed the voice of\r\nthe LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his\r\nservants the prophets.\r\n\r\n9:11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,\r\nthat they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon\r\nus, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of\r\nGod, because we have sinned against him.\r\n\r\n9:12 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and\r\nagainst our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil:\r\nfor under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n9:13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon\r\nus: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might\r\nturn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.\r\n\r\n9:14 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it\r\nupon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he\r\ndoeth: for we obeyed not his voice.\r\n\r\n9:15 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out\r\nof the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown,\r\nas at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.\r\n\r\n9:16 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let\r\nthine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy\r\nholy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our\r\nfathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that\r\nare about us.\r\n\r\n9:17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his\r\nsupplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is\r\ndesolate, for the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n9:18 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and\r\nbehold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for\r\nwe do not present our supplications before thee for our\r\nrighteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.\r\n\r\n9:19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,\r\nfor thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called\r\nby thy name.\r\n\r\n9:20 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and\r\nthe sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the\r\nLORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 9:21 Yea, whiles I was\r\nspeaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the\r\nvision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about\r\nthe time of the evening oblation.\r\n\r\n9:22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am\r\nnow come forth to give thee skill and understanding.\r\n\r\n9:23 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth,\r\nand I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore\r\nunderstand the matter, and consider the vision.\r\n\r\n9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy\r\ncity, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to\r\nmake reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting\r\nrighteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint\r\nthe most Holy.\r\n\r\n9:25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the\r\ncommandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the\r\nPrince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street\r\nshall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.\r\n\r\n9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but\r\nnot for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall\r\ndestroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with\r\na flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.\r\n\r\n9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in\r\nthe midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to\r\ncease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it\r\ndesolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be\r\npoured upon the desolate.\r\n\r\n10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed\r\nunto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was\r\ntrue, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing,\r\nand had understanding of the vision.\r\n\r\n10:2 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.\r\n\r\n10:3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,\r\nneither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n10:4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by\r\nthe side of the great river, which is Hiddekel; 10:5 Then I lifted up\r\nmine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen,\r\nwhose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 10:6 His body also\r\nwas like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and\r\nhis eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to\r\npolished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n10:7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me\r\nsaw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they\r\nfled to hide themselves.\r\n\r\n10:8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there\r\nremained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into\r\ncorruption, and I retained no strength.\r\n\r\n10:9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of\r\nhis words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n10:10 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and\r\nupon the palms of my hands.\r\n\r\n10:11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand\r\nthe words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am\r\nI now sent.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.\r\n\r\n10:12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day\r\nthat thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself\r\nbefore thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.\r\n\r\n10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and\r\ntwenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help\r\nme; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.\r\n\r\n10:14 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy\r\npeople in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.\r\n\r\n10:15 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward\r\nthe ground, and I became dumb.\r\n\r\n10:16 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched\r\nmy lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that\r\nstood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon\r\nme, and I have retained no strength.\r\n\r\n10:17 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?\r\nfor as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither\r\nis there breath left in me.\r\n\r\n10:18 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of\r\na man, and he strengthened me, 10:19 And said, O man greatly beloved,\r\nfear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he\r\nhad spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak;\r\nfor thou hast strengthened me.\r\n\r\n10:20 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now\r\nwill I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone\r\nforth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.\r\n\r\n10:21 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of\r\ntruth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but\r\nMichael your prince.\r\n\r\n11:1 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to\r\nconfirm and to strengthen him.\r\n\r\n11:2 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up\r\nyet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than\r\nthey all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all\r\nagainst the realm of Grecia.\r\n\r\n11:3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great\r\ndominion, and do according to his will.\r\n\r\n11:4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and\r\nshall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his\r\nposterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his\r\nkingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.\r\n\r\n11:5 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his\r\nprinces; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his\r\ndominion shall be a great dominion.\r\n\r\n11:6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north\r\nto make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm;\r\nneither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and\r\nthey that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened\r\nher in these times.\r\n\r\n11:7 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his\r\nestate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the\r\nfortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and\r\nshall prevail: 11:8 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their\r\ngods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver\r\nand of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n11:9 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall\r\nreturn into his own land.\r\n\r\n11:10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude\r\nof great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass\r\nthrough: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\n11:11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall\r\ncome forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he\r\nshall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given\r\ninto his hand.\r\n\r\n11:12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be\r\nlifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not\r\nbe strengthened by it.\r\n\r\n11:13 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a\r\nmultitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after\r\ncertain years with a great army and with much riches.\r\n\r\n11:14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of\r\nthe south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to\r\nestablish the vision; but they shall fall.\r\n\r\n11:15 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and\r\ntake the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not\r\nwithstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any\r\nstrength to withstand.\r\n\r\n11:16 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own\r\nwill, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the\r\nglorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.\r\n\r\n11:17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his\r\nwhole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he\r\nshall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall\r\nnot stand on his side, neither be for him.\r\n\r\n11:18 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take\r\nmany: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered\r\nby him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n11:19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but\r\nhe shall stumble and fall, and not be found.\r\n\r\n11:20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory\r\nof the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in\r\nanger, nor in battle.\r\n\r\n11:21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they\r\nshall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in\r\npeaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.\r\n\r\n11:22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before\r\nhim, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.\r\n\r\n11:23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:\r\nfor he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.\r\n\r\n11:24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the\r\nprovince; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor\r\nhis fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil,\r\nand riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong\r\nholds, even for a time.\r\n\r\n11:25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king\r\nof the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be\r\nstirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall\r\nnot stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.\r\n\r\n11:26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy\r\nhim, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.\r\n\r\n11:27 And both of these kings\xe2\x80\x99 hearts shall be to do mischief, and\r\nthey shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet\r\nthe end shall be at the time appointed.\r\n\r\n11:28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his\r\nheart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits,\r\nand return to his own land.\r\n\r\n11:29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the\r\nsouth; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.\r\n\r\n11:30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he\r\nshall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy\r\ncovenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence\r\nwith them that forsake the holy covenant.\r\n\r\n11:31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the\r\nsanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and\r\nthey shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.\r\n\r\n11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by\r\nflatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and\r\ndo exploits.\r\n\r\n11:33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:\r\nyet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by\r\nspoil, many days.\r\n\r\n11:34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little\r\nhelp: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.\r\n\r\n11:35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and\r\nto purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because\r\nit is yet for a time appointed.\r\n\r\n11:36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt\r\nhimself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak\r\nmarvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the\r\nindignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n11:37 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire\r\nof women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.\r\n\r\n11:38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god\r\nwhom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and\r\nwith precious stones, and pleasant things.\r\n\r\n11:39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,\r\nwhom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause\r\nthem to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.\r\n\r\n11:40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at\r\nhim: and the king of the north shall come against him like a\r\nwhirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and\r\nhe shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.\r\n\r\n11:41 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries\r\nshall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even\r\nEdom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.\r\n\r\n11:42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the\r\nland of Egypt shall not escape.\r\n\r\n11:43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of\r\nsilver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and\r\nthe Ethiopians shall be at his steps.\r\n\r\n11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble\r\nhim: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and\r\nutterly to make away many.\r\n\r\n11:45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the\r\nseas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and\r\nnone shall help him.\r\n\r\n12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which\r\nstandeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of\r\ntrouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same\r\ntime: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that\r\nshall be found written in the book.\r\n\r\n12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,\r\nsome to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.\r\n\r\n12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the\r\nfirmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for\r\never and ever.\r\n\r\n12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to\r\nthe time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n12:5 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one\r\non this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of\r\nthe bank of the river.\r\n\r\n12:6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the\r\nwaters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?\r\n12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters\r\nof the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto\r\nheaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a\r\ntime, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to\r\nscatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n12:8 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what\r\nshall be the end of these things?  12:9 And he said, Go thy way,\r\nDaniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n12:10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the\r\nwicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but\r\nthe wise shall understand.\r\n\r\n12:11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away,\r\nand the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a\r\nthousand two hundred and ninety days.\r\n\r\n12:12 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three\r\nhundred and five and thirty days.\r\n\r\n12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest,\r\nand stand in thy lot at the end of the days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHosea\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in\r\nthe days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in\r\nthe days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:2 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said\r\nto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of\r\nwhoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n1:3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which\r\nconceived, and bare him a son.\r\n\r\n1:4 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a\r\nlittle while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of\r\nJehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow\r\nof Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.\r\n\r\n1:6 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto\r\nhim, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the\r\nhouse of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.\r\n\r\n1:7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them\r\nby the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword,\r\nnor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.\r\n\r\n1:8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.\r\n\r\n1:9 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and\r\nI will not be your God.\r\n\r\n1:10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of\r\nthe sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to\r\npass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my\r\npeople, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the\r\nliving God.\r\n\r\n1:11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be\r\ngathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall\r\ncome up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.\r\n\r\n2:1 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.\r\n\r\n2:2 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am\r\nI her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her\r\nsight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 2:3 Lest I strip\r\nher naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her\r\nas a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\n2:4 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the\r\nchildren of whoredoms.\r\n\r\n2:5 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them\r\nhath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that\r\ngive me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n2:6 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a\r\nwall, that she shall not find her paths.\r\n\r\n2:7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake\r\nthem; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she\r\nsay, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better\r\nwith me than now.\r\n\r\n2:8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and\r\nmultiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.\r\n\r\n2:9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time\r\nthereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool\r\nand my flax given to cover her nakedness.\r\n\r\n2:10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,\r\nand none shall deliver her out of mine hand.\r\n\r\n2:11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new\r\nmoons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.\r\n\r\n2:12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath\r\nsaid, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will\r\nmake them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.\r\n\r\n2:13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned\r\nincense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her\r\njewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the\r\nwilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.\r\n\r\n2:15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of\r\nAchor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of\r\nher youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n2:16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call\r\nme Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.\r\n\r\n2:17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and\r\nthey shall no more be remembered by their name.\r\n\r\n2:18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts\r\nof the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping\r\nthings of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the\r\nbattle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.\r\n\r\n2:19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth\r\nthee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness,\r\nand in mercies.\r\n\r\n2:20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt\r\nknow the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the\r\nLORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; 2:22 And\r\nthe earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they\r\nshall hear Jezreel.\r\n\r\n2:23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy\r\nupon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which\r\nwere not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art\r\nmy God.\r\n\r\n3:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her\r\nfriend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward\r\nthe children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n3:2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an\r\nhomer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 3:3 And I said unto her,\r\nThou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and\r\nthou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.\r\n\r\n3:4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king,\r\nand without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image,\r\nand without an ephod, and without teraphim: 3:5 Afterward shall the\r\nchildren of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David\r\ntheir king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD\r\nhath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is\r\nno truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.\r\n\r\n4:2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing\r\nadultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.\r\n\r\n4:3 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth\r\ntherein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the\r\nfowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.\r\n\r\n4:4 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as\r\nthey that strive with the priest.\r\n\r\n4:5 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall\r\nfall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.\r\n\r\n4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast\r\nrejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no\r\npriest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will\r\nalso forget thy children.\r\n\r\n4:7 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will\r\nI change their glory into shame.\r\n\r\n4:8 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on\r\ntheir iniquity.\r\n\r\n4:9 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish\r\nthem for their ways, and reward them their doings.\r\n\r\n4:10 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit\r\nwhoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take\r\nheed to the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.\r\n\r\n4:12 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth\r\nunto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and\r\nthey have gone a whoring from under their God.\r\n\r\n4:13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense\r\nupon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow\r\nthereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and\r\nyour spouses shall commit adultery.\r\n\r\n4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor\r\nyour spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated\r\nwith whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people\r\nthat doth not understand shall fall.\r\n\r\n4:15 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend;\r\nand come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear,\r\nThe LORD liveth.\r\n\r\n4:16 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD\r\nwill feed them as a lamb in a large place.\r\n\r\n4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.\r\n\r\n4:18 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:\r\nher rulers with shame do love, Give ye.\r\n\r\n4:19 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be\r\nashamed because of their sacrifices.\r\n\r\n5:1 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give\r\nye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye\r\nhave been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.\r\n\r\n5:2 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have\r\nbeen a rebuker of them all.\r\n\r\n5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,\r\nthou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.\r\n\r\n5:4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the\r\nspirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known\r\nthe LORD.\r\n\r\n5:5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall\r\nIsrael and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n5:6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the\r\nLORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n5:7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have\r\nbegotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their\r\nportions.\r\n\r\n5:8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud\r\nat Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.\r\n\r\n5:9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes\r\nof Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.\r\n\r\n5:10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:\r\ntherefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.\r\n\r\n5:11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly\r\nwalked after the commandment.\r\n\r\n5:12 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of\r\nJudah as rottenness.\r\n\r\n5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went\r\nEphraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal\r\nyou, nor cure you of your wound.\r\n\r\n5:14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the\r\nhouse of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away,\r\nand none shall rescue him.\r\n\r\n5:15 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their\r\noffence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n6:1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he\r\nwill heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.\r\n\r\n6:2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise\r\nus up, and we shall live in his sight.\r\n\r\n6:3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going\r\nforth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the\r\nrain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\r\n\r\n6:4 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do\r\nunto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early\r\ndew it goeth away.\r\n\r\n6:5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by\r\nthe words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n6:6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God\r\nmore than burnt offerings.\r\n\r\n6:7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they\r\ndealt treacherously against me.\r\n\r\n6:8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n6:9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests\r\nmurder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.\r\n\r\n6:10 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is\r\nthe whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.\r\n\r\n6:11 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned\r\nthe captivity of my people.\r\n\r\n7:1 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was\r\ndiscovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood;\r\nand the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.\r\n\r\n7:2 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their\r\nwickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are\r\nbefore my face.\r\n\r\n7:3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes\r\nwith their lies.\r\n\r\n7:4 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who\r\nceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be\r\nleavened.\r\n\r\n7:5 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles\r\nof wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.\r\n\r\n7:6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie\r\nin wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth\r\nas a flaming fire.\r\n\r\n7:7 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all\r\ntheir kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.\r\n\r\n7:8 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake\r\nnot turned.\r\n\r\n7:9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea,\r\ngray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.\r\n\r\n7:10 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not\r\nreturn to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.\r\n\r\n7:11 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to\r\nEgypt, they go to Assyria.\r\n\r\n7:12 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring\r\nthem down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their\r\ncongregation hath heard.\r\n\r\n7:13 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!\r\nbecause they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed\r\nthem, yet they have spoken lies against me.\r\n\r\n7:14 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they\r\nhowled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine,\r\nand they rebel against me.\r\n\r\n7:15 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they\r\nimagine mischief against me.\r\n\r\n7:16 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful\r\nbow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their\r\ntongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:1 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against\r\nthe house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and\r\ntrespassed against my law.\r\n\r\n8:2 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.\r\n\r\n8:3 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall\r\npursue him.\r\n\r\n8:4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and\r\nI knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them\r\nidols, that they may be cut off.\r\n\r\n8:5 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled\r\nagainst them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?  8:6\r\nFor from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not\r\nGod: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.\r\n\r\n8:7 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it\r\nhath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the\r\nstrangers shall swallow it up.\r\n\r\n8:8 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a\r\nvessel wherein is no pleasure.\r\n\r\n8:9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:\r\nEphraim hath hired lovers.\r\n\r\n8:10 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather\r\nthem, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\n8:11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be\r\nunto him to sin.\r\n\r\n8:12 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were\r\ncounted as a strange thing.\r\n\r\n8:13 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and\r\neat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their\r\niniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:14 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and\r\nJudah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his\r\ncities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.\r\n\r\n9:1 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast\r\ngone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every\r\ncornfloor.\r\n\r\n9:2 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine\r\nshall fail in her.\r\n\r\n9:3 They shall not dwell in the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s land; but Ephraim shall return\r\nto Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.\r\n\r\n9:4 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall\r\nthey be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the\r\nbread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their\r\nbread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:5 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of\r\nthe LORD?  9:6 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt\r\nshall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for\r\ntheir silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their\r\ntabernacles.\r\n\r\n9:7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come;\r\nIsrael shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad,\r\nfor the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.\r\n\r\n9:8 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a\r\nsnare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.\r\n\r\n9:9 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah:\r\ntherefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.\r\n\r\n9:10 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers\r\nas the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to\r\nBaalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their\r\nabominations were according as they loved.\r\n\r\n9:11 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the\r\nbirth, and from the womb, and from the conception.\r\n\r\n9:12 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,\r\nthat there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I\r\ndepart from them!  9:13 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a\r\npleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\n9:14 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying\r\nwomb and dry breasts.\r\n\r\n9:15 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for\r\nthe wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I\r\nwill love them no more: all their princes are revolters.\r\n\r\n9:16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no\r\nfruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved\r\nfruit of their womb.\r\n\r\n9:17 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto\r\nhim: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.\r\n\r\n10:1 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:\r\naccording to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars;\r\naccording to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.\r\n\r\n10:2 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall\r\nbreak down their altars, he shall spoil their images.\r\n\r\n10:3 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not\r\nthe LORD; what then should a king do to us?  10:4 They have spoken\r\nwords, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth\r\nup as hemlock in the furrows of the field.\r\n\r\n10:5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of\r\nBethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests\r\nthereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is\r\ndeparted from it.\r\n\r\n10:6 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king\r\nJareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his\r\nown counsel.\r\n\r\n10:7 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.\r\n\r\n10:8 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be\r\ndestroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars;\r\nand they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall\r\non us.\r\n\r\n10:9 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they\r\nstood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not\r\novertake them.\r\n\r\n10:10 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people\r\nshall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in\r\ntheir two furrows.\r\n\r\n10:11 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread\r\nout the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make\r\nEphraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.\r\n\r\n10:12 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your\r\nfallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain\r\nrighteousness upon you.\r\n\r\n10:13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have\r\neaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the\r\nmultitude of thy mighty men.\r\n\r\n10:14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy\r\nfortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day\r\nof battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.\r\n\r\n10:15 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in\r\na morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.\r\n\r\n11:1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out\r\nof Egypt.\r\n\r\n11:2 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto\r\nBaalim, and burned incense to graven images.\r\n\r\n11:3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they\r\nknew not that I healed them.\r\n\r\n11:4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to\r\nthem as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat\r\nunto them.\r\n\r\n11:5 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian\r\nshall be his king, because they refused to return.\r\n\r\n11:6 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his\r\nbranches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.\r\n\r\n11:7 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called\r\nthem to the most High, none at all would exalt him.\r\n\r\n11:8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,\r\nIsrael?  how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as\r\nZeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not\r\nreturn to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in\r\nthe midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.\r\n\r\n11:10 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when\r\nhe shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.\r\n\r\n11:11 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of\r\nthe land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n11:12 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel\r\nwith deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the\r\nsaints.\r\n\r\n12:1 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he\r\ndaily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with\r\nthe Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.\r\n\r\n12:2 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish\r\nJacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he\r\nrecompense him.\r\n\r\n12:3 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength\r\nhe had power with God: 12:4 Yea, he had power over the angel, and\r\nprevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in\r\nBethel, and there he spake with us; 12:5 Even the LORD God of hosts;\r\nthe LORD is his memorial.\r\n\r\n12:6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait\r\non thy God continually.\r\n\r\n12:7 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he\r\nloveth to oppress.\r\n\r\n12:8 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out\r\nsubstance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that\r\nwere sin.\r\n\r\n12:9 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet\r\nmake thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.\r\n\r\n12:10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied\r\nvisions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.\r\n\r\n12:11 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they\r\nsacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the\r\nfurrows of the fields.\r\n\r\n12:12 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for\r\na wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.\r\n\r\n12:13 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a\r\nprophet was he preserved.\r\n\r\n12:14 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he\r\nleave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n13:1 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but\r\nwhen he offended in Baal, he died.\r\n\r\n13:2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images\r\nof their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all\r\nof it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that\r\nsacrifice kiss the calves.\r\n\r\n13:3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew\r\nthat passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out\r\nof the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.\r\n\r\n13:4 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt\r\nknow no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.\r\n\r\n13:5 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.\r\n\r\n13:6 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were\r\nfilled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.\r\n\r\n13:7 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way\r\nwill I observe them: 13:8 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved\r\nof her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I\r\ndevour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.\r\n\r\n13:9 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.\r\n\r\n13:10 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all\r\nthy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and\r\nprinces?  13:11 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in\r\nmy wrath.\r\n\r\n13:12 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.\r\n\r\n13:13 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an\r\nunwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking\r\nforth of children.\r\n\r\n13:14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem\r\nthem from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be\r\nthy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.\r\n\r\n13:15 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall\r\ncome, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his\r\nspring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall\r\nspoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.\r\n\r\n13:16 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her\r\nGod: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in\r\npieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.\r\n\r\n14:1 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by\r\nthine iniquity.\r\n\r\n14:2 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take\r\naway all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the\r\ncalves of our lips.\r\n\r\n14:3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither\r\nwill we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in\r\nthee the fatherless findeth mercy.\r\n\r\n14:4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine\r\nanger is turned away from him.\r\n\r\n14:5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and\r\ncast forth his roots as Lebanon.\r\n\r\n14:6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive\r\ntree, and his smell as Lebanon.\r\n\r\n14:7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive\r\nas the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the\r\nwine of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n14:8 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have\r\nheard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is\r\nthy fruit found.\r\n\r\n14:9 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and\r\nhe shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just\r\nshall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoel\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.\r\n\r\n1:2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\nHath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?  1:3\r\nTell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their\r\nchildren, and their children another generation.\r\n\r\n1:4 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and\r\nthat which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that\r\nwhich the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.\r\n\r\n1:5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,\r\nbecause of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.\r\n\r\n1:6 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,\r\nwhose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a\r\ngreat lion.\r\n\r\n1:7 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made\r\nit clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.\r\n\r\n1:8 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n1:9 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house\r\nof the LORD; the priests, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s ministers, mourn.\r\n\r\n1:10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted:\r\nthe new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.\r\n\r\n1:11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the\r\nwheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n1:12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the\r\npomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the\r\ntrees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from\r\nthe sons of men.\r\n\r\n1:13 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of\r\nthe altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God:\r\nfor the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the\r\nhouse of your God.\r\n\r\n1:14 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and\r\nall the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God,\r\nand cry unto the LORD, 1:15 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD\r\nis at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.\r\n\r\n1:16 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness\r\nfrom the house of our God?  1:17 The seed is rotten under their clods,\r\nthe garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn\r\nis withered.\r\n\r\n1:18 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,\r\nbecause they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\n1:19 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the\r\npastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n1:20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of\r\nwaters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy\r\nmountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of\r\nthe LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; 2:2 A day of darkness and of\r\ngloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning\r\nspread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not\r\nbeen ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the\r\nyears of many generations.\r\n\r\n2:3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the\r\nland is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate\r\nwilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.\r\n\r\n2:4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as\r\nhorsemen, so shall they run.\r\n\r\n2:5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they\r\nleap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as\r\na strong people set in battle array.\r\n\r\n2:6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall\r\ngather blackness.\r\n\r\n2:7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men\r\nof war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not\r\nbreak their ranks: 2:8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall\r\nwalk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they\r\nshall not be wounded.\r\n\r\n2:9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the\r\nwall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the\r\nwindows like a thief.\r\n\r\n2:10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the\r\nsun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their\r\nshining: 2:11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for\r\nhis camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for\r\nthe day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?\r\n2:12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all\r\nyour heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:\r\n2:13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the\r\nLORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of\r\ngreat kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.\r\n\r\n2:14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing\r\nbehind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD\r\nyour God?  2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a\r\nsolemn assembly: 2:16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,\r\nassemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the\r\nbreasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out\r\nof her closet.\r\n\r\n2:17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the\r\nporch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and\r\ngive not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over\r\nthem: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?\r\n2:18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.\r\n\r\n2:19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will\r\nsend you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith:\r\nand I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: 2:20 But I\r\nwill remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him\r\ninto a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea,\r\nand his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come\r\nup, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n2:21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the\r\nwilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and\r\nthe vine do yield their strength.\r\n\r\n2:23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your\r\nGod: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will\r\ncause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter\r\nrain in the first month.\r\n\r\n2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall\r\noverflow with wine and oil.\r\n\r\n2:25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,\r\nthe cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army\r\nwhich I sent among you.\r\n\r\n2:26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name\r\nof the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my\r\npeople shall never be ashamed.\r\n\r\n2:27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am\r\nthe LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my\r\nspirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall\r\nprophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see\r\nvisions: 2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in\r\nthose days will I pour out my spirit.\r\n\r\n2:30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,\r\nand fire, and pillars of smoke.\r\n\r\n2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,\r\nbefore the great and terrible day of the LORD come.\r\n\r\n2:32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name\r\nof the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem\r\nshall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom\r\nthe LORD shall call.\r\n\r\n3:1 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring\r\nagain the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 3:2 I will also gather all\r\nnations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and\r\nwill plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel,\r\nwhom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.\r\n\r\n3:3 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an\r\nharlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.\r\n\r\n3:4 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all\r\nthe coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye\r\nrecompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon\r\nyour own head; 3:5 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and\r\nhave carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 3:6 The\r\nchildren also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto\r\nthe Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.\r\n\r\n3:7 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold\r\nthem, and will return your recompence upon your own head: 3:8 And I\r\nwill sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children\r\nof Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far\r\noff: for the LORD hath spoken it.\r\n\r\n3:9 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the\r\nmighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: 3:10\r\nBeat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears:\r\nlet the weak say, I am strong.\r\n\r\n3:11 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather\r\nyourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come\r\ndown, O LORD.\r\n\r\n3:12 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of\r\nJehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n3:13 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you\r\ndown; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness\r\nis great.\r\n\r\n3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of\r\nthe LORD is near in the valley of decision.\r\n\r\n3:15 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall\r\nwithdraw their shining.\r\n\r\n3:16 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from\r\nJerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD\r\nwill be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n3:17 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my\r\nholy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no\r\nstrangers pass through her any more.\r\n\r\n3:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall\r\ndrop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the\r\nrivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come\r\nforth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of\r\nShittim.\r\n\r\n3:19 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate\r\nwilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because\r\nthey have shed innocent blood in their land.\r\n\r\n3:20 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n3:21 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the\r\nLORD dwelleth in Zion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmos\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he\r\nsaw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the\r\ndays of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n1:2 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice\r\nfrom Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and\r\nthe top of Carmel shall wither.\r\n\r\n1:3 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have\r\nthreshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron: 1:4 But I will\r\nsend a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces\r\nof Benhadad.\r\n\r\n1:5 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant\r\nfrom the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the\r\nhouse of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto\r\nKir, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:6 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they\r\ncarried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:\r\n1:7 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the\r\npalaces thereof: 1:8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,\r\nand him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine\r\nhand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,\r\nsaith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n1:9 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they\r\ndelivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the\r\nbrotherly covenant: 1:10 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus,\r\nwhich shall devour the palaces thereof.\r\n\r\n1:11 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did\r\npursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his\r\nanger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: 1:12 But I\r\nwill send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.\r\n\r\n1:13 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of\r\nAmmon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof;\r\nbecause they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they\r\nmight enlarge their border: 1:14 But I will kindle a fire in the wall\r\nof Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in\r\nthe day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: 1:15\r\nAnd their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:1 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned\r\nthe bones of the king of Edom into lime: 2:2 But I will send a fire\r\nupon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall\r\ndie with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: 2:3\r\nAnd I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all\r\nthe princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:4 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have\r\ndespised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and\r\ntheir lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have\r\nwalked: 2:5 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the\r\npalaces of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2:6 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for\r\nfour, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold\r\nthe righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; 2:7 That\r\npant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn\r\naside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto\r\nthe same maid, to profane my holy name: 2:8 And they lay themselves\r\ndown upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the\r\nwine of the condemned in the house of their god.\r\n\r\n2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the\r\nheight of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed\r\nhis fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.\r\n\r\n2:10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty\r\nyears through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.\r\n\r\n2:11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men\r\nfor Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n2:12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the\r\nprophets, saying, Prophesy not.\r\n\r\n2:13 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full\r\nof sheaves.\r\n\r\n2:14 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong\r\nshall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver\r\nhimself: 2:15 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he\r\nthat is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that\r\nrideth the horse deliver himself.\r\n\r\n2:16 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked\r\nin that day, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:1 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children\r\nof Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land\r\nof Egypt, saying, 3:2 You only have I known of all the families of the\r\nearth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.\r\n\r\n3:3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?  3:4 Will a lion\r\nroar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of\r\nhis den, if he have taken nothing?  3:5 Can a bird fall in a snare\r\nupon the earth, where no gin is for him?  shall one take up a snare\r\nfrom the earth, and have taken nothing at all?  3:6 Shall a trumpet be\r\nblown in the city, and the people not be afraid?  shall there be evil\r\nin a city, and the LORD hath not done it?  3:7 Surely the Lord GOD\r\nwill do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the\r\nprophets.\r\n\r\n3:8 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken,\r\nwho can but prophesy?  3:9 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in\r\nthe palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon\r\nthe mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst\r\nthereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.\r\n\r\n3:10 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up\r\nviolence and robbery in their palaces.\r\n\r\n3:11 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be\r\neven round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from\r\nthee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.\r\n\r\n3:12 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of\r\nthe lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of\r\nIsrael be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and\r\nin Damascus in a couch.\r\n\r\n3:13 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD,\r\nthe God of hosts, 3:14 That in the day that I shall visit the\r\ntransgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of\r\nBethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n3:15 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the\r\nhouses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:1 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of\r\nSamaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to\r\ntheir masters, Bring, and let us drink.\r\n\r\n4:2 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall\r\ncome upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your\r\nposterity with fishhooks.\r\n\r\n4:3 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is\r\nbefore her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:4 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression;\r\nand bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three\r\nyears: 4:5 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and\r\nproclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye\r\nchildren of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\n4:6 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\r\nand want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto\r\nme, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:7 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet\r\nthree months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city,\r\nand caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained\r\nupon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.\r\n\r\n4:8 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but\r\nthey were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n4:9 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and\r\nyour vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the\r\npalmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n4:10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt:\r\nyour young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your\r\nhorses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your\r\nnostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:11 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and\r\nGomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet\r\nhave ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n4:12 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will\r\ndo this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.\r\n\r\n4:13 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,\r\nand declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning\r\ndarkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD,\r\nThe God of hosts, is his name.\r\n\r\n5:1 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation,\r\nO house of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is\r\nforsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.\r\n\r\n5:3 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand\r\nshall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall\r\nleave ten, to the house of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:4 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and\r\nye shall live: 5:5 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and\r\npass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and\r\nBethel shall come to nought.\r\n\r\n5:6 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in\r\nthe house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in\r\nBethel.\r\n\r\n5:7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in\r\nthe earth, 5:8 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and\r\nturneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark\r\nwith night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them\r\nout upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: 5:9 That\r\nstrengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled\r\nshall come against the fortress.\r\n\r\n5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that\r\nspeaketh uprightly.\r\n\r\n5:11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye\r\ntake from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone,\r\nbut ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards,\r\nbut ye shall not drink wine of them.\r\n\r\n5:12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:\r\nthey afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor\r\nin the gate from their right.\r\n\r\n5:13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is\r\nan evil time.\r\n\r\n5:14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the\r\nGod of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.\r\n\r\n5:15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the\r\ngate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the\r\nremnant of Joseph.\r\n\r\n5:16 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus;\r\nWailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the\r\nhighways, Alas! alas!  and they shall call the husbandman to mourning,\r\nand such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.\r\n\r\n5:17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through\r\nthee, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n5:18 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it\r\nfor you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.\r\n\r\n5:19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went\r\ninto the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n5:20 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even\r\nvery dark, and no brightness in it?  5:21 I hate, I despise your feast\r\ndays, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.\r\n\r\n5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I\r\nwill not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of\r\nyour fat beasts.\r\n\r\n5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not\r\nhear the melody of thy viols.\r\n\r\n5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a\r\nmighty stream.\r\n\r\n5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the\r\nwilderness forty years, O house of Israel?  5:26 But ye have borne the\r\ntabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god,\r\nwhich ye made to yourselves.\r\n\r\n5:27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,\r\nsaith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.\r\n\r\n6:1 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of\r\nSamaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of\r\nIsrael came!  6:2 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye\r\nto Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they\r\nbetter than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?\r\n6:3 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence\r\nto come near; 6:4 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves\r\nupon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves\r\nout of the midst of the stall; 6:5 That chant to the sound of the\r\nviol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; 6:6\r\nThat drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief\r\nointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.\r\n\r\n6:7 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go\r\ncaptive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n6:8 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of\r\nhosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:\r\ntherefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.\r\n\r\n6:9 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house,\r\nthat they shall die.\r\n\r\n6:10 And a man\xe2\x80\x99s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to\r\nbring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is\r\nby the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall\r\nsay, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make\r\nmention of the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:11 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great\r\nhouse with breaches, and the little house with clefts.\r\n\r\n6:12 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?\r\nfor ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness\r\ninto hemlock: 6:13 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say,\r\nHave we not taken to us horns by our own strength?  6:14 But, behold,\r\nI will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the\r\nLORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in\r\nof Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n7:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed\r\ngrasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;\r\nand, lo, it was the latter growth after the king\xe2\x80\x99s mowings.\r\n\r\n7:2 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the\r\ngrass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee:\r\nby whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.\r\n\r\n7:3 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n7:4 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD\r\ncalled to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat\r\nup a part.\r\n\r\n7:5 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall\r\nJacob arise? for he is small.\r\n\r\n7:6 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord\r\nGOD.\r\n\r\n7:7 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by\r\na plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.\r\n\r\n7:8 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A\r\nplumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the\r\nmidst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more: 7:9\r\nAnd the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of\r\nIsrael shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of\r\nJeroboam with the sword.\r\n\r\n7:10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of\r\nIsrael, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the\r\nhouse of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.\r\n\r\n7:11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel\r\nshall surely be led away captive out of their own land.\r\n\r\n7:12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into\r\nthe land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 7:13 But\r\nprophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king\xe2\x80\x99s chapel,\r\nand it is the king\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\n\r\n7:14 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,\r\nneither was I a prophet\xe2\x80\x99s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of\r\nsycomore fruit: 7:15 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and\r\nthe LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.\r\n\r\n7:16 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,\r\nProphesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house\r\nof Isaac.\r\n\r\n7:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the\r\ncity, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy\r\nland shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land:\r\nand Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.\r\n\r\n8:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of\r\nsummer fruit.\r\n\r\n8:2 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer\r\nfruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of\r\nIsrael; I will not again pass by them any more.\r\n\r\n8:3 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith\r\nthe Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they\r\nshall cast them forth with silence.\r\n\r\n8:4 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor\r\nof the land to fail, 8:5 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that\r\nwe may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making\r\nthe ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by\r\ndeceit?  8:6 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a\r\npair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?  8:7 The LORD\r\nhath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any\r\nof their works.\r\n\r\n8:8 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that\r\ndwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall\r\nbe cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.\r\n\r\n8:9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I\r\nwill cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in\r\nthe clear day: 8:10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all\r\nyour songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all\r\nloins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the\r\nmourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.\r\n\r\n8:11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a\r\nfamine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but\r\nof hearing the words of the LORD: 8:12 And they shall wander from sea\r\nto sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro\r\nto seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.\r\n\r\n8:13 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\n8:14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan,\r\nliveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and\r\nnever rise up again.\r\n\r\n9:1 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the\r\nlintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the\r\nhead, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he\r\nthat fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them\r\nshall not be delivered.\r\n\r\n9:2 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;\r\nthough they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: 9:3 And\r\nthough they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and\r\ntake them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the\r\nbottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall\r\nbite them: 9:4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies,\r\nthence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will\r\nset mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.\r\n\r\n9:5 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it\r\nshall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise\r\nup wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n9:6 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded\r\nhis troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and\r\npoureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.\r\n\r\n9:7 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of\r\nIsrael? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land\r\nof Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?\r\n9:8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and\r\nI will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will\r\nnot utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among\r\nall nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the\r\nleast grain fall upon the earth.\r\n\r\n9:10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say,\r\nThe evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.\r\n\r\n9:11 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is\r\nfallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his\r\nruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 9:12 That they may\r\npossess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called\r\nby my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.\r\n\r\n9:13 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall\r\novertake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed;\r\nand the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.\r\n\r\n9:14 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and\r\nthey shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall\r\nplant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make\r\ngardens, and eat the fruit of them.\r\n\r\n9:15 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be\r\npulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD\r\nthy God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObadiah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom;\r\nWe have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among\r\nthe heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.\r\n\r\n1:2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\n1:3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in\r\nthe clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his\r\nheart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?  1:4 Though thou exalt\r\nthyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars,\r\nthence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut\r\noff!)  would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the\r\ngrapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?  1:6\r\nHow are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things\r\nsought up!  1:7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even\r\nto the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived\r\nthee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have laid a\r\nwound under thee: there is none understanding in him.\r\n\r\n1:8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men\r\nout of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?  1:9 And thy\r\nmighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of\r\nthe mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.\r\n\r\n1:10 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover\r\nthee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.\r\n\r\n1:11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that\r\nthe strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered\r\ninto his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n1:12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in\r\nthe day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have\r\nrejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction;\r\nneither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.\r\n\r\n1:13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the\r\nday of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their\r\naffliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their\r\nsubstance in the day of their calamity; 1:14 Neither shouldest thou\r\nhave stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape;\r\nneither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain\r\nin the day of distress.\r\n\r\n1:15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou\r\nhast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon\r\nthine own head.\r\n\r\n1:16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the\r\nheathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall\r\nswallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.\r\n\r\n1:17 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be\r\nholiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.\r\n\r\n1:18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a\r\nflame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in\r\nthem, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the\r\nhouse of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.\r\n\r\n1:19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they\r\nof the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of\r\nEphraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.\r\n\r\n1:20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall\r\npossess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity\r\nof Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n1:21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of\r\nEsau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJonah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,\r\nsaying, 1:2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it;\r\nfor their wickedness is come up before me.\r\n\r\n1:3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the\r\nLORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish:\r\nso he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them\r\nunto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:4 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a\r\nmighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.\r\n\r\n1:5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god,\r\nand cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to\r\nlighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the\r\nship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.\r\n\r\n1:6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest\r\nthou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will\r\nthink upon us, that we perish not.\r\n\r\n1:7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,\r\nthat we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast\r\nlots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.\r\n\r\n1:8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause\r\nthis evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest\r\nthou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?  1:9 And he\r\nsaid unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of\r\nheaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.\r\n\r\n1:10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast\r\nthou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the\r\nLORD, because he had told them.\r\n\r\n1:11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea\r\nmay be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.\r\n\r\n1:12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the\r\nsea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake\r\nthis great tempest is upon you.\r\n\r\n1:13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they\r\ncould not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.\r\n\r\n1:14 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O\r\nLORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man\xe2\x80\x99s life, and lay\r\nnot upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n1:15 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the\r\nsea ceased from her raging.\r\n\r\n1:16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice\r\nunto the LORD, and made vows.\r\n\r\n1:17 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And\r\nJonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.\r\n\r\n2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish\xe2\x80\x99s belly,\r\n2:2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and\r\nhe heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n2:3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;\r\nand the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves\r\npassed over me.\r\n\r\n2:4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again\r\ntoward thy holy temple.\r\n\r\n2:5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed\r\nme round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.\r\n\r\n2:6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her\r\nbars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from\r\ncorruption, O LORD my God.\r\n\r\n2:7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my\r\nprayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.\r\n\r\n2:8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.\r\n\r\n2:9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I\r\nwill pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon\r\nthe dry land.\r\n\r\n3:1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,\r\n3:2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the\r\npreaching that I bid thee.\r\n\r\n3:3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of\r\nthe LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days\xe2\x80\x99\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n3:4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, and he\r\ncried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.\r\n\r\n3:5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and\r\nput on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.\r\n\r\n3:6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his\r\nthrone, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,\r\nand sat in ashes.\r\n\r\n3:7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by\r\nthe decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor\r\nbeast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink\r\nwater: 3:8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry\r\nmightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and\r\nfrom the violence that is in their hands.\r\n\r\n3:9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his\r\nfierce anger, that we perish not?  3:10 And God saw their works, that\r\nthey turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he\r\nhad said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.\r\n\r\n4:1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.\r\n\r\n4:2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was\r\nnot this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled\r\nbefore unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and\r\nmerciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of\r\nthe evil.\r\n\r\n4:3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for\r\nit is better for me to die than to live.\r\n\r\n4:4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?  4:5 So Jonah\r\nwent out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there\r\nmade him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see\r\nwhat would become of the city.\r\n\r\n4:6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over\r\nJonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from\r\nhis grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.\r\n\r\n4:7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it\r\nsmote the gourd that it withered.\r\n\r\n4:8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a\r\nvehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he\r\nfainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me\r\nto die than to live.\r\n\r\n4:9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?\r\nAnd he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.\r\n\r\n4:10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the\r\nwhich thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in\r\na night, and perished in a night: 4:11 And should not I spare Nineveh,\r\nthat great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that\r\ncannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also\r\nmuch cattle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the\r\ndays of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw\r\nconcerning Samaria and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is:\r\nand let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n1:3 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come\r\ndown, and tread upon the high places of the earth.\r\n\r\n1:4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall\r\nbe cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured\r\ndown a steep place.\r\n\r\n1:5 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of\r\nthe house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not\r\nSamaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not\r\nJerusalem?  1:6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field,\r\nand as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones\r\nthereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.\r\n\r\n1:7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and\r\nall the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols\r\nthereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an\r\nharlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.\r\n\r\n1:8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I\r\nwill make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.\r\n\r\n1:9 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come\r\nunto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:10 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of\r\nAphrah roll thyself in the dust.\r\n\r\n1:11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked:\r\nthe inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel;\r\nhe shall receive of you his standing.\r\n\r\n1:12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil\r\ncame down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift\r\nbeast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for\r\nthe transgressions of Israel were found in thee.\r\n\r\n1:14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses\r\nof Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he\r\nshall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge\r\nthy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.\r\n\r\n2:1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds!\r\nwhen the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the\r\npower of their hand.\r\n\r\n2:2 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and\r\ntake them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and\r\nhis heritage.\r\n\r\n2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I\r\ndevise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither\r\nshall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.\r\n\r\n2:4 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament\r\nwith a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath\r\nchanged the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me!\r\nturning away he hath divided our fields.\r\n\r\n2:5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in\r\nthe congregation of the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:6 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not\r\nprophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.\r\n\r\n2:7 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the\r\nLORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him\r\nthat walketh uprightly?  2:8 Even of late my people is risen up as an\r\nenemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by\r\nsecurely as men averse from war.\r\n\r\n2:9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant\r\nhouses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.\r\n\r\n2:10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is\r\npolluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.\r\n\r\n2:11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I\r\nwill prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be\r\nthe prophet of this people.\r\n\r\n2:12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely\r\ngather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of\r\nBozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great\r\nnoise by reason of the multitude of men.\r\n\r\n2:13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have\r\npassed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall\r\npass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.\r\n\r\n3:1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of\r\nthe house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?  3:2 Who hate\r\nthe good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them,\r\nand their flesh from off their bones; 3:3 Who also eat the flesh of my\r\npeople, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones,\r\nand chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the\r\ncaldron.\r\n\r\n3:4 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he\r\nwill even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved\r\nthemselves ill in their doings.\r\n\r\n3:5 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people\r\nerr, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth\r\nnot into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.\r\n\r\n3:6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a\r\nvision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and\r\nthe sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n3:7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea,\r\nthey shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.\r\n\r\n3:8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of\r\njudgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and\r\nto Israel his sin.\r\n\r\n3:9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes\r\nof the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.\r\n\r\n3:10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.\r\n\r\n3:11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach\r\nfor hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they\r\nlean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can\r\ncome upon us.\r\n\r\n3:12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and\r\nJerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the\r\nhigh places of the forest.\r\n\r\n4:1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of\r\nthe house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the\r\nmountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall\r\nflow unto it.\r\n\r\n4:2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to\r\nthe mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he\r\nwill teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law\r\nshall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n4:3 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations\r\nafar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their\r\nspears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against\r\nnation, neither shall they learn war any more.\r\n\r\n4:4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig\r\ntree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of\r\nhosts hath spoken it.\r\n\r\n4:5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we\r\nwill walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n4:6 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and\r\nI will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;\r\n4:7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast\r\nfar off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount\r\nZion from henceforth, even for ever.\r\n\r\n4:8 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of\r\nZion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom\r\nshall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n4:9 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy\r\ncounsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.\r\n\r\n4:10 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a\r\nwoman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and\r\nthou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon;\r\nthere shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from\r\nthe hand of thine enemies.\r\n\r\n4:11 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let\r\nher be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.\r\n\r\n4:12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand\r\nthey his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n4:13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn\r\niron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces\r\nmany people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their\r\nsubstance unto the Lord of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n5:1 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid\r\nsiege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon\r\nthe cheek.\r\n\r\n5:2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the\r\nthousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that\r\nis to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old,\r\nfrom everlasting.\r\n\r\n5:3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which\r\ntravaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall\r\nreturn unto the children of Israel.\r\n\r\n5:4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the\r\nmajesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now\r\nshall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n5:5 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into\r\nour land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise\r\nagainst him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.\r\n\r\n5:6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the\r\nland of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from\r\nthe Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth\r\nwithin our borders.\r\n\r\n5:7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a\r\ndew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not\r\nfor man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.\r\n\r\n5:8 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst\r\nof many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young\r\nlion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth\r\ndown, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.\r\n\r\n5:9 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all\r\nthine enemies shall be cut off.\r\n\r\n5:10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I\r\nwill cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy\r\nthy chariots: 5:11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and\r\nthrow down all thy strong holds: 5:12 And I will cut off witchcrafts\r\nout of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: 5:13 Thy\r\ngraven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the\r\nmidst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.\r\n\r\n5:14 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will\r\nI destroy thy cities.\r\n\r\n5:15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen,\r\nsuch as they have not heard.\r\n\r\n6:1 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the\r\nmountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.\r\n\r\n6:2 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s controversy, and ye strong\r\nfoundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his\r\npeople, and he will plead with Israel.\r\n\r\n6:3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I\r\nwearied thee? testify against me.\r\n\r\n6:4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee\r\nout of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and\r\nMiriam.\r\n\r\n6:5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and\r\nwhat Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal;\r\nthat ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.\r\n\r\n6:6 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the\r\nhigh God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of\r\na year old?  6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or\r\nwith ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my\r\ntransgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  6:8 He\r\nhath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require\r\nof thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with\r\nthy God?  6:9 The LORD\xe2\x80\x99s voice crieth unto the city, and the man of\r\nwisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.\r\n\r\n6:10 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the\r\nwicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?  6:11 Shall I count\r\nthem pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful\r\nweights?  6:12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the\r\ninhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in\r\ntheir mouth.\r\n\r\n6:13 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making\r\nthee desolate because of thy sins.\r\n\r\n6:14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall\r\nbe in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not\r\ndeliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.\r\n\r\n6:15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the\r\nolives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but\r\nshalt not drink wine.\r\n\r\n6:16 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house\r\nof Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a\r\ndesolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall\r\nbear the reproach of my people.\r\n\r\n7:1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,\r\nas the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my\r\nsoul desired the firstripe fruit.\r\n\r\n7:2 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none\r\nupright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man\r\nhis brother with a net.\r\n\r\n7:3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince\r\nasketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he\r\nuttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.\r\n\r\n7:4 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a\r\nthorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now\r\nshall be their perplexity.\r\n\r\n7:5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep\r\nthe doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.\r\n\r\n7:6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up\r\nagainst her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s enemies are the men of his own house.\r\n\r\n7:7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my\r\nsalvation: my God will hear me.\r\n\r\n7:8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;\r\nwhen I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.\r\n\r\n7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned\r\nagainst him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he\r\nwill bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n7:10 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover\r\nher which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall\r\nbehold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.\r\n\r\n7:11 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the\r\ndecree be far removed.\r\n\r\n7:12 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and\r\nfrom the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river,\r\nand from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.\r\n\r\n7:13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that\r\ndwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.\r\n\r\n7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which\r\ndwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in\r\nBashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.\r\n\r\n7:15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will\r\nI shew unto him marvellous things.\r\n\r\n7:16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they\r\nshall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.\r\n\r\n7:17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of\r\ntheir holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD\r\nour God, and shall fear because of thee.\r\n\r\n7:18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth\r\nby the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not\r\nhis anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.\r\n\r\n7:19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will\r\nsubdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the\r\ndepths of the sea.\r\n\r\n7:20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham,\r\nwhich thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNahum\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.\r\n\r\n1:2 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is\r\nfurious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he\r\nreserveth wrath for his enemies.\r\n\r\n1:3 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all\r\nacquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the\r\nstorm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.\r\n\r\n1:4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the\r\nrivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon\r\nlanguisheth.\r\n\r\n1:5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is\r\nburned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.\r\n\r\n1:6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the\r\nfierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the\r\nrocks are thrown down by him.\r\n\r\n1:7 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he\r\nknoweth them that trust in him.\r\n\r\n1:8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the\r\nplace thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.\r\n\r\n1:9 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end:\r\naffliction shall not rise up the second time.\r\n\r\n1:10 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are\r\ndrunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.\r\n\r\n1:11 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the\r\nLORD, a wicked counsellor.\r\n\r\n1:12 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet\r\nthus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have\r\nafflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.\r\n\r\n1:13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy\r\nbonds in sunder.\r\n\r\n1:14 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no\r\nmore of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off\r\nthe graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou\r\nart vile.\r\n\r\n1:15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good\r\ntidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts,\r\nperform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he\r\nis utterly cut off.\r\n\r\n2:1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the\r\nmunition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power\r\nmightily.\r\n\r\n2:2 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the\r\nexcellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and\r\nmarred their vine branches.\r\n\r\n2:3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in\r\nscarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his\r\npreparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.\r\n\r\n2:4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one\r\nagainst another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they\r\nshall run like the lightnings.\r\n\r\n2:5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk;\r\nthey shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n2:6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n2:7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and\r\nher maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon\r\ntheir breasts.\r\n\r\n2:8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee\r\naway.\r\n\r\nStand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.\r\n\r\n2:9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is\r\nnone end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.\r\n\r\n2:10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the\r\nknees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of\r\nthem all gather blackness.\r\n\r\n2:11 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the\r\nyoung lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhelp, and none made them afraid?  2:12 The lion did tear in pieces\r\nenough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his\r\nholes with prey, and his dens with ravin.\r\n\r\n2:13 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will\r\nburn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young\r\nlions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of\r\nthy messengers shall no more be heard.\r\n\r\n3:1 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the\r\nprey departeth not; 3:2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the\r\nrattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping\r\nchariots.\r\n\r\n3:3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering\r\nspear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of\r\ncarcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon\r\ntheir corpses: 3:4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the\r\nwellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations\r\nthrough her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.\r\n\r\n3:5 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will\r\ndiscover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy\r\nnakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.\r\n\r\n3:6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile,\r\nand will set thee as a gazingstock.\r\n\r\n3:7 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall\r\nflee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?\r\nwhence shall I seek comforters for thee?  3:8 Art thou better than\r\npopulous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters\r\nround about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the\r\nsea?  3:9 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite;\r\nPut and Lubim were thy helpers.\r\n\r\n3:10 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young\r\nchildren also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and\r\nthey cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were\r\nbound in chains.\r\n\r\n3:11 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt\r\nseek strength because of the enemy.\r\n\r\n3:12 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe\r\nfigs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the\r\neater.\r\n\r\n3:13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of\r\nthy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall\r\ndevour thy bars.\r\n\r\n3:14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into\r\nclay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.\r\n\r\n3:15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off,\r\nit shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the\r\ncankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.\r\n\r\n3:16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the\r\ncankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.\r\n\r\n3:17 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great\r\ngrasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the\r\nsun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they\r\nare.\r\n\r\n3:18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell\r\nin the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man\r\ngathereth them.\r\n\r\n3:19 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all\r\nthat hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon\r\nwhom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHabakkuk\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.\r\n\r\n1:2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out\r\nunto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!  1:3 Why dost thou shew\r\nme iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and\r\nviolence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\n1:4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth:\r\nfor the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong\r\njudgment proceedeth.\r\n\r\n1:5 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously:\r\nfor I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though\r\nit be told you.\r\n\r\n1:6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation,\r\nwhich shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the\r\ndwellingplaces that are not theirs.\r\n\r\n1:7 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity\r\nshall proceed of themselves.\r\n\r\n1:8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more\r\nfierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread\r\nthemselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as\r\nthe eagle that hasteth to eat.\r\n\r\n1:9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the\r\neast wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.\r\n\r\n1:10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a\r\nscorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall\r\nheap dust, and take it.\r\n\r\n1:11 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,\r\nimputing this his power unto his god.\r\n\r\n1:12 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we\r\nshall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O\r\nmighty God, thou hast established them for correction.\r\n\r\n1:13 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on\r\niniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,\r\nand holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more\r\nrighteous than he?  1:14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as\r\nthe creeping things, that have no ruler over them?  1:15 They take up\r\nall of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather\r\nthem in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.\r\n\r\n1:16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto\r\ntheir drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat\r\nplenteous.\r\n\r\n1:17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually\r\nto slay the nations?  2:1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon\r\nthe tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I\r\nshall answer when I am reproved.\r\n\r\n2:2 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it\r\nplain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.\r\n\r\n2:3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it\r\nshall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it\r\nwill surely come, it will not tarry.\r\n\r\n2:4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the\r\njust shall live by his faith.\r\n\r\n2:5 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,\r\nneither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as\r\ndeath, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations,\r\nand heapeth unto him all people: 2:6 Shall not all these take up a\r\nparable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe\r\nto him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him\r\nthat ladeth himself with thick clay!  2:7 Shall they not rise up\r\nsuddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou\r\nshalt be for booties unto them?  2:8 Because thou hast spoiled many\r\nnations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all\r\nthat dwell therein.\r\n\r\n2:9 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that\r\nhe may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power\r\nof evil!  2:10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off\r\nmany people, and hast sinned against thy soul.\r\n\r\n2:11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the\r\ntimber shall answer it.\r\n\r\n2:12 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a\r\ncity by iniquity!  2:13 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that\r\nthe people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary\r\nthemselves for very vanity?  2:14 For the earth shall be filled with\r\nthe knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.\r\n\r\n2:15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy\r\nbottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on\r\ntheir nakedness!  2:16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink\r\nthou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on\r\nthy glory.\r\n\r\n2:17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of\r\nbeasts, which made them afraid, because of men\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and for the\r\nviolence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.\r\n\r\n2:18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath\r\ngraven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of\r\nhis work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?  2:19 Woe unto him that\r\nsaith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach!\r\nBehold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath\r\nat all in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n2:20 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep\r\nsilence before him.\r\n\r\n3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.\r\n\r\n3:2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive\r\nthy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make\r\nknown; in wrath remember mercy.\r\n\r\n3:3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His\r\nglory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.\r\n\r\n3:4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of\r\nhis hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\r\n\r\n3:5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n3:6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the\r\nnations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual\r\nhills did bow: his ways are everlasting.\r\n\r\n3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the\r\nland of Midian did tremble.\r\n\r\n3:8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger\r\nagainst the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst\r\nride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?  3:9 Thy bow was\r\nmade quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word.\r\nSelah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.\r\n\r\n3:10 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the\r\nwater passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands\r\non high.\r\n\r\n3:11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of\r\nthine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.\r\n\r\n3:12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst\r\nthresh the heathen in anger.\r\n\r\n3:13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for\r\nsalvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the\r\nhouse of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck.\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\n3:14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his\r\nvillages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing\r\nwas as to devour the poor secretly.\r\n\r\n3:15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the\r\nheap of great waters.\r\n\r\n3:16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:\r\nrottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I\r\nmight rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people,\r\nhe will invade them with his troops.\r\n\r\n3:17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be\r\nin the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall\r\nyield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there\r\nshall be no herd in the stalls: 3:18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I\r\nwill joy in the God of my salvation.\r\n\r\n3:19 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.

the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land\r\nof the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no\r\ninhabitant.\r\n\r\n2:6 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds,\r\nand folds for flocks.\r\n\r\n2:7 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they\r\nshall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in\r\nthe evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away\r\ntheir captivity.\r\n\r\n2:8 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the\r\nchildren of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and\r\nmagnified themselves against their border.\r\n\r\n2:9 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,\r\nSurely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah,\r\neven the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual\r\ndesolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant\r\nof my people shall possess them.\r\n\r\n2:10 This shall they have for their pride, because they have\r\nreproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n2:11 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the\r\ngods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his\r\nplace, even all the isles of the heathen.\r\n\r\n2:12 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.\r\n\r\n2:13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy\r\nAssyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n2:14 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of\r\nthe nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the\r\nupper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation\r\nshall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.\r\n\r\n2:15 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in\r\nher heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a\r\ndesolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth\r\nby her shall hiss, and wag his hand.\r\n\r\n3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!\r\n3:2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted\r\nnot in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.\r\n\r\n3:3 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening\r\nwolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.\r\n\r\n3:4 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have\r\npolluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.\r\n\r\n3:5 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity:\r\nevery morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but\r\nthe unjust knoweth no shame.\r\n\r\n3:6 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made\r\ntheir streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed,\r\nso that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.\r\n\r\n3:7 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction;\r\nso their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them:\r\nbut they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.\r\n\r\n3:8 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I\r\nrise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations,\r\nthat I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation,\r\neven all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the\r\nfire of my jealousy.\r\n\r\n3:9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may\r\nall call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.\r\n\r\n3:10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the\r\ndaughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.\r\n\r\n3:11 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein\r\nthou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of\r\nthe midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no\r\nmore be haughty because of my holy mountain.\r\n\r\n3:12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor\r\npeople, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\n3:13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;\r\nneither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they\r\nshall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.\r\n\r\n3:14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice\r\nwith all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3:15 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine\r\nenemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee:\r\nthou shalt not see evil any more.\r\n\r\n3:16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to\r\nZion, Let not thine hands be slack.\r\n\r\n3:17 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he\r\nwill rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy\r\nover thee with singing.\r\n\r\n3:18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,\r\nwho are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.\r\n\r\n3:19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I\r\nwill save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I\r\nwill get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put\r\nto shame.\r\n\r\n3:20 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I\r\ngather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people\r\nof the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaggai\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the\r\nfirst day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the\r\nprophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and\r\nto Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, 1:2 Thus\r\nspeaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not\r\ncome, the time that the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house should be built.\r\n\r\n1:3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, 1:4\r\nIs it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this\r\nhouse lie waste?  1:5 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;\r\nConsider your ways.\r\n\r\n1:6 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not\r\nenough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but\r\nthere is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it\r\ninto a bag with holes.\r\n\r\n1:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.\r\n\r\n1:8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I\r\nwill take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:9 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought\r\nit home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of\r\nmine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.\r\n\r\n1:10 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth\r\nis stayed from her fruit.\r\n\r\n1:11 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,\r\nand upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon\r\nthat which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle,\r\nand upon all the labour of the hands.\r\n\r\n1:12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of\r\nJosedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed\r\nthe voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet,\r\nas the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n1:13 Then spake Haggai the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s messenger in the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s message unto\r\nthe people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of\r\nShealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of\r\nJosedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the\r\npeople; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts,\r\ntheir God, 1:15 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in\r\nthe second year of Darius the king.\r\n\r\n2:1 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month,\r\ncame the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, 2:2 Speak now\r\nto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua\r\nthe son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the\r\npeople, saying, 2:3 Who is left among you that saw this house in her\r\nfirst glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in\r\ncomparison of it as nothing?  2:4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel,\r\nsaith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high\r\npriest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and\r\nwork: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: 2:5 According to the\r\nword that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my\r\nspirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.\r\n\r\n2:6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while,\r\nand I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry\r\nland; 2:7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations\r\nshall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n2:9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the\r\nformer, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace,\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n2:10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second\r\nyear of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,\r\nsaying, 2:11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests\r\nconcerning the law, saying, 2:12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt\r\nof his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or\r\nwine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered\r\nand said, No.\r\n\r\n2:13 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any\r\nof these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It\r\nshall be unclean.\r\n\r\n2:14 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this\r\nnation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands;\r\nand that which they offer there is unclean.\r\n\r\n2:15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from\r\nbefore a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: 2:16\r\nSince those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures,\r\nthere were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out\r\nfifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.\r\n\r\n2:17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all\r\nthe labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and\r\ntwentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the\r\nfoundation of the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s temple was laid, consider it.\r\n\r\n2:19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig\r\ntree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth:\r\nfrom this day will I bless you.\r\n\r\n2:20 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and\r\ntwentieth day of the month, saying, 2:21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor\r\nof Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; 2:22 And I\r\nwill overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength\r\nof the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and\r\nthose that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come\r\ndown, every one by the sword of his brother.\r\n\r\n2:23 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O\r\nZerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will\r\nmake thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZechariah\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word\r\nof the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the\r\nprophet, saying, 1:2 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n1:3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn\r\nye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith\r\nthe LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n1:4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have\r\ncried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your\r\nevil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor\r\nhearken unto me, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:5 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for\r\never?  1:6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants\r\nthe prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they\r\nreturned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us,\r\naccording to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n1:7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is\r\nthe month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the\r\nLORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the\r\nprophet, saying, 1:8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a\r\nred horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the\r\nbottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.\r\n\r\n1:9 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked\r\nwith me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.\r\n\r\n1:10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said,\r\nThese are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n1:11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the\r\nmyrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth,\r\nand, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.\r\n\r\n1:12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,\r\nhow long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of\r\nJudah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and\r\nten years?  1:13 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me\r\nwith good words and comfortable words.\r\n\r\n1:14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,\r\nsaying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and\r\nfor Zion with a great jealousy.\r\n\r\n1:15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease:\r\nfor I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\n1:16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with\r\nmercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a\r\nline shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through\r\nprosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort\r\nZion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:18 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.\r\n\r\n1:19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And\r\nhe answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah,\r\nIsrael, and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1:20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.\r\n\r\n1:21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These\r\nare the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up\r\nhis head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of\r\nthe Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to\r\nscatter it.\r\n\r\n2:1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a\r\nmeasuring line in his hand.\r\n\r\n2:2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure\r\nJerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n2:3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another\r\nangel went out to meet him, 2:4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this\r\nyoung man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls\r\nfor the multitude of men and cattle therein: 2:5 For I, saith the\r\nLORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the\r\nglory in the midst of her.\r\n\r\n2:6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the\r\nLORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven,\r\nsaith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\n2:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me\r\nunto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth\r\nthe apple of his eye.\r\n\r\n2:9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a\r\nspoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath\r\nsent me.\r\n\r\n2:10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will\r\ndwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n2:11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and\r\nshall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou\r\nshalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.\r\n\r\n2:12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,\r\nand shall choose Jerusalem again.\r\n\r\n2:13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out\r\nof his holy habitation.\r\n\r\n3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel\r\nof the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.\r\n\r\n3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even\r\nthe LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand\r\nplucked out of the fire?  3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy\r\ngarments, and stood before the angel.\r\n\r\n3:4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,\r\nsaying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said,\r\nBehold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will\r\nclothe thee with change of raiment.\r\n\r\n3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a\r\nfair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel\r\nof the LORD stood by.\r\n\r\n3:6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 3:7 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou\r\nwilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt\r\nalso keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these\r\nthat stand by.\r\n\r\n3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit\r\nbefore thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring\r\nforth my servant the BRANCH.\r\n\r\n3:9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one\r\nstone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof,\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land\r\nin one day.\r\n\r\n3:10 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his\r\nneighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.\r\n\r\n4:1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a\r\nman that is wakened out of his sleep.\r\n\r\n4:2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and\r\nbehold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and\r\nhis seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are\r\nupon the top thereof: 4:3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the\r\nright side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.\r\n\r\n4:4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying,\r\nWhat are these, my lord?  4:5 Then the angel that talked with me\r\nanswered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said,\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\n4:6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of\r\nthe LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by\r\nmy spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n4:7 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt\r\nbecome a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with\r\nshoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.\r\n\r\n4:8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 4:9 The hands\r\nof Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall\r\nalso finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent\r\nme unto you.\r\n\r\n4:10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall\r\nrejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with\r\nthose seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro\r\nthrough the whole earth.\r\n\r\n4:11 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive\r\ntrees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side\r\nthereof?  4:12 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these\r\ntwo olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden\r\noil out of themselves?  4:13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou\r\nnot what these be? And I said, No, my lord.\r\n\r\n4:14 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the\r\nLORD of the whole earth.\r\n\r\n5:1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a\r\nflying roll.\r\n\r\n5:2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a\r\nflying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth\r\nthereof ten cubits.\r\n\r\n5:3 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the\r\nface of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off\r\nas on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be\r\ncut off as on that side according to it.\r\n\r\n5:4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter\r\ninto the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth\r\nfalsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and\r\nshall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.\r\n\r\n5:5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me,\r\nLift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.\r\n\r\n5:6 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth\r\nforth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n5:7 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a\r\nwoman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.\r\n\r\n5:8 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of\r\nthe ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.\r\n\r\n5:9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came\r\nout two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings\r\nlike the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the\r\nearth and the heaven.\r\n\r\n5:10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these\r\nbear the ephah?  5:11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the\r\nland of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her\r\nown base.\r\n\r\n6:1 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold,\r\nthere came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the\r\nmountains were mountains of brass.\r\n\r\n6:2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot\r\nblack horses; 6:3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the\r\nfourth chariot grisled and bay horses.\r\n\r\n6:4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What\r\nare these, my lord?  6:5 And the angel answered and said unto me,\r\nThese are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from\r\nstanding before the LORD of all the earth.\r\n\r\n6:6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north\r\ncountry; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth\r\ntoward the south country.\r\n\r\n6:7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to\r\nand fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro\r\nthrough the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.\r\n\r\n6:8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these\r\nthat go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n6:9 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:10 Take of them\r\nof the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which\r\nare come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the\r\nhouse of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 6:11 Then take silver and gold,\r\nand make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of\r\nJosedech, the high priest; 6:12 And speak unto him, saying, Thus\r\nspeaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The\r\nBRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the\r\ntemple of the LORD: 6:13 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD;\r\nand he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne;\r\nand he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace\r\nshall be between them both.\r\n\r\n6:14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,\r\nand to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the\r\nLORD.\r\n\r\n6:15 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of\r\nthe LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto\r\nyou. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice\r\nof the LORD your God.\r\n\r\n7:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the\r\nword of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth\r\nmonth, even in Chisleu; 7:2 When they had sent unto the house of God\r\nSherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 7:3\r\nAnd to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of\r\nhosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month,\r\nseparating myself, as I have done these so many years?  7:4 Then came\r\nthe word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 7:5 Speak unto all the\r\npeople of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and\r\nmourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did\r\nye at all fast unto me, even to me?  7:6 And when ye did eat, and when\r\nye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?\r\n7:7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the\r\nformer prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and\r\nthe cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and\r\nthe plain?  7:8 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,\r\n7:9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment,\r\nand shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 7:10 And\r\noppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor;\r\nand let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.\r\n\r\n7:11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and\r\nstopped their ears, that they should not hear.\r\n\r\n7:12 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should\r\nhear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his\r\nspirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the\r\nLORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n7:13 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would\r\nnot hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of\r\nhosts: 7:14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the\r\nnations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,\r\nthat no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant\r\nland desolate.\r\n\r\n8:1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 8:2 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy,\r\nand I was jealous for her with great fury.\r\n\r\n8:3 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in\r\nthe midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth;\r\nand the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.\r\n\r\n8:4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old\r\nwomen dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff\r\nin his hand for very age.\r\n\r\n8:5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls\r\nplaying in the streets thereof.\r\n\r\n8:6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of\r\nthe remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous\r\nin mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n8:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from\r\nthe east country, and from the west country; 8:8 And I will bring\r\nthem, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall\r\nbe my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.\r\n\r\n8:9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that\r\nhear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which\r\nwere in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts\r\nwas laid, that the temple might be built.\r\n\r\n8:10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for\r\nbeast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in\r\nbecause of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\n8:11 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the\r\nformer days, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n8:12 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit,\r\nand the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give\r\ntheir dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n8:13 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the\r\nheathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you,\r\nand ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.\r\n\r\n8:14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,\r\nwhen your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I\r\nrepented not: 8:15 So again have I thought in these days to do well\r\nunto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.\r\n\r\n8:16 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the\r\ntruth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in\r\nyour gates: 8:17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts\r\nagainst his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are\r\nthings that I hate, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 8:19 Thus\r\nsaith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of\r\nthe fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth,\r\nshall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts;\r\ntherefore love the truth and peace.\r\n\r\n8:20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that\r\nthere shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: 8:21 And\r\nthe inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go\r\nspeedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I\r\nwill go also.\r\n\r\n8:22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD\r\nof hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.\r\n\r\n8:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to\r\npass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the\r\nnations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,\r\nsaying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.\r\n\r\n9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and\r\nDamascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all\r\nthe tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.\r\n\r\n9:2 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it\r\nbe very wise.\r\n\r\n9:3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as\r\nthe dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.\r\n\r\n9:4 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in\r\nthe sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.\r\n\r\n9:5 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be\r\nvery sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and\r\nthe king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.\r\n\r\n9:6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride\r\nof the Philistines.\r\n\r\n9:7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his\r\nabominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he,\r\nshall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and\r\nEkron as a Jebusite.\r\n\r\n9:8 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of\r\nhim that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no\r\noppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with\r\nmine eyes.\r\n\r\n9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of\r\nJerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having\r\nsalvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of\r\nan ass.\r\n\r\n9:10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from\r\nJerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak\r\npeace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to\r\nsea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\n9:11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth\r\nthy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.\r\n\r\n9:12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do\r\nI declare that I will render double unto thee; 9:13 When I have bent\r\nJudah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O\r\nZion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a\r\nmighty man.\r\n\r\n9:14 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go\r\nforth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and\r\nshall go with whirlwinds of the south.\r\n\r\n9:15 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and\r\nsubdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as\r\nthrough wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners\r\nof the altar.\r\n\r\n9:16 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock\r\nof his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up\r\nas an ensign upon his land.\r\n\r\n9:17 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn\r\nshall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.\r\n\r\n10:1 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the\r\nLORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every\r\none grass in the field.\r\n\r\n10:2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a\r\nlie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they\r\nwent their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no\r\nshepherd.\r\n\r\n10:3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the\r\ngoats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of\r\nJudah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.\r\n\r\n10:4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him\r\nthe battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.\r\n\r\n10:5 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies\r\nin the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight,\r\nbecause the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\n10:6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the\r\nhouse of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have\r\nmercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off:\r\nfor I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.\r\n\r\n10:7 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart\r\nshall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and\r\nbe glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.\r\n\r\n10:8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them:\r\nand they shall increase as they have increased.\r\n\r\n10:9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me\r\nin far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n10:10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and\r\ngather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of\r\nGilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.\r\n\r\n10:11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall\r\nsmite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry\r\nup: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of\r\nEgypt shall depart away.\r\n\r\n10:12 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up\r\nand down in his name, saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.\r\n\r\n11:2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are\r\nspoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is\r\ncome down.\r\n\r\n11:3 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory\r\nis spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of\r\nJordan is spoiled.\r\n\r\n11:4 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5\r\nWhose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they\r\nthat sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own\r\nshepherds pity them not.\r\n\r\n11:6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the\r\nLORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbours\r\nhand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land,\r\nand out of their hand I will not deliver them.\r\n\r\n11:7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the\r\nflock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the\r\nother I called Bands; and I fed the flock.\r\n\r\n11:8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed\r\nthem, and their soul also abhorred me.\r\n\r\n11:9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;\r\nand that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest\r\neat every one the flesh of another.\r\n\r\n11:10 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I\r\nmight break my covenant which I had made with all the people.\r\n\r\n11:11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that\r\nwaited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if\r\nnot, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.\r\n\r\n11:13 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly\r\nprice that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of\r\nsilver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.\r\n\r\n11:14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might\r\nbreak the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\r\n\r\n11:15 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of\r\na foolish shepherd.\r\n\r\n11:16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not\r\nvisit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor\r\nheal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he\r\nshall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.\r\n\r\n11:17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall\r\nbe upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried\r\nup, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.\r\n\r\n12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,\r\nwhich stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the\r\nearth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.\r\n\r\n12:2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the\r\npeople round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah\r\nand against Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all\r\npeople: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces,\r\nthough all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.\r\n\r\n12:4 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with\r\nastonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes\r\nupon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\n12:5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts\r\ntheir God.\r\n\r\n12:6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of\r\nfire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they\r\nshall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the\r\nleft: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:7 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory\r\nof the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do\r\nnot magnify themselves against Judah.\r\n\r\n12:8 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;\r\nand he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and\r\nthe house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n12:9 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to\r\ndestroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n12:10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications:\r\nand they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall\r\nmourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in\r\nbitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.\r\n\r\n12:11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the\r\nmourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.\r\n\r\n12:12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the\r\nhouse of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house\r\nof Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 12:13 The family of the house\r\nof Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and\r\ntheir wives apart; 12:14 All the families that remain, every family\r\napart, and their wives apart.\r\n\r\n13:1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of\r\nDavid and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.\r\n\r\n13:2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,\r\nthat I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they\r\nshall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and\r\nthe unclean spirit to pass out of the land.\r\n\r\n13:3 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then\r\nhis father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou\r\nshalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and\r\nhis father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when\r\nhe prophesieth.\r\n\r\n13:4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be\r\nashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither\r\nshall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 13:5 But he shall say, I\r\nam no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle\r\nfrom my youth.\r\n\r\n13:6 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?\r\nThen he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of\r\nmy friends.\r\n\r\n13:7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is\r\nmy fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep\r\nshall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.\r\n\r\n13:8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD,\r\ntwo parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be\r\nleft therein.\r\n\r\n13:9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine\r\nthem as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they\r\nshall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my\r\npeople: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.\r\n\r\n14:1 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be\r\ndivided in the midst of thee.\r\n\r\n14:2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and\r\nthe city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women\r\nravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the\r\nresidue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.\r\n\r\n14:3 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as\r\nwhen he fought in the day of battle.\r\n\r\n14:4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,\r\nwhich is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall\r\ncleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and\r\nthere shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall\r\nremove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.\r\n\r\n14:5 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley\r\nof the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye\r\nfled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah:\r\nand the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.\r\n\r\n14:6 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not\r\nbe clear, nor dark: 14:7 But it shall be one day which shall be known\r\nto the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at\r\nevening time it shall be light.\r\n\r\n14:8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from\r\nJerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward\r\nthe hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.\r\n\r\n14:9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall\r\nthere be one LORD, and his name one.\r\n\r\n14:10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon\r\nsouth of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her\r\nplace, from Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the\r\ncorner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwinepresses.\r\n\r\n14:11 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter\r\ndestruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.\r\n\r\n14:12 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all\r\nthe people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall\r\nconsume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall\r\nconsume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in\r\ntheir mouth.\r\n\r\n14:13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from\r\nthe LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the\r\nhand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of\r\nhis neighbour.\r\n\r\n14:14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all\r\nthe heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver,\r\nand apparel, in great abundance.\r\n\r\n14:15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the\r\ncamel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these\r\ntents, as this plague.\r\n\r\n14:16 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all\r\nthe nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to\r\nyear to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of\r\ntabernacles.\r\n\r\n14:17 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families\r\nof the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,\r\neven upon them shall be no rain.\r\n\r\n14:18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no\r\nrain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the\r\nheathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.\r\n\r\n14:19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all\r\nnations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.\r\n\r\n14:20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,\r\nHOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD\xe2\x80\x99s house shall be like\r\nthe bowls before the altar.\r\n\r\n14:21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto\r\nthe LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of\r\nthem, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the\r\nCanaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalachi\r\n\r\n\r\n1:1 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.\r\n\r\n1:2 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou\r\nloved us? Was not Esau Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved\r\nJacob, 1:3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage\r\nwaste for the dragons of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n1:4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and\r\nbuild the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall\r\nbuild, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of\r\nwickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for\r\never.\r\n\r\n1:5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be\r\nmagnified from the border of Israel.\r\n\r\n1:6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be\r\na father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my\r\nfear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my\r\nname. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?  1:7 Ye offer\r\npolluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted\r\nthee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.\r\n\r\n1:8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye\r\noffer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy\r\ngovernor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith\r\nthe LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n1:9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:\r\nthis hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the\r\nLORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n1:10 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?\r\nneither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure\r\nin you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at\r\nyour hand.\r\n\r\n1:11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the\r\nsame my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place\r\nincense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my\r\nname shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n1:12 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is\r\npolluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.\r\n\r\n1:13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed\r\nat it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn,\r\nand the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I\r\naccept this of your hand? saith the LORD.\r\n\r\n1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and\r\nvoweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a\r\ngreat King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the\r\nheathen.\r\n\r\n2:1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.\r\n\r\n2:2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give\r\nglory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse\r\nupon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them\r\nalready, because ye do not lay it to heart.\r\n\r\n2:3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,\r\neven the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n2:4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that\r\nmy covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n2:5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him\r\nfor the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.\r\n\r\n2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in\r\nhis lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many\r\naway from iniquity.\r\n\r\n2:7 For the priest\xe2\x80\x99s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek\r\nthe law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n2:8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble\r\nat the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n2:9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all\r\nthe people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been\r\npartial in the law.\r\n\r\n2:10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do\r\nwe deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the\r\ncovenant of our fathers?  2:11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an\r\nabomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath\r\nprofaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the\r\ndaughter of a strange god.\r\n\r\n2:12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the\r\nscholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an\r\noffering unto the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n2:13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with\r\ntears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth\r\nnot the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n2:14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between\r\nthee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt\r\ntreacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.\r\n\r\n2:15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.\r\nAnd wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take\r\nheed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife\r\nof his youth.\r\n\r\n2:16 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting\r\naway: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of\r\nhosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not\r\ntreacherously.\r\n\r\n2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein\r\nhave we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in\r\nthe sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God\r\nof judgment?  3:1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall\r\nprepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly\r\ncome to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye\r\ndelight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when\r\nhe appeareth? for he is like a refiner\xe2\x80\x99s fire, and like fullers\xe2\x80\x99 soap:\r\n3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall\r\npurify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they\r\nmay offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.\r\n\r\n3:4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto\r\nthe LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\r\n\r\n3:5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift\r\nwitness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against\r\nfalse swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his\r\nwages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger\r\nfrom his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are\r\nnot consumed.\r\n\r\n3:7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine\r\nordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return\r\nunto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we\r\nreturn?  3:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say,\r\nWherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.\r\n\r\n3:9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be\r\nmeat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of\r\nhosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out\r\na blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\r\n\r\n3:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not\r\ndestroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her\r\nfruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n3:12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a\r\ndelightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n3:13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye\r\nsay, What have we spoken so much against thee?  3:14 Ye have said, It\r\nis vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his\r\nordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of\r\nhosts?  3:15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work\r\nwickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.\r\n\r\n3:16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and\r\nthe LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was\r\nwritten before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought\r\nupon his name.\r\n\r\n3:17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when\r\nI make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own\r\nson that serveth him.\r\n\r\n3:18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the\r\nwicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.\r\n\r\n4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all\r\nthe proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the\r\nday that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it\r\nshall leave them neither root nor branch.\r\n\r\n4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness\r\narise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as\r\ncalves of the stall.\r\n\r\n4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under\r\nthe soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD\r\nof hosts.\r\n\r\n4:4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto\r\nhim in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.\r\n\r\n4:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of\r\nthe great and dreadful day of the LORD: 4:6 And he shall turn the\r\nheart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to\r\ntheir fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\r\n\r\n\r\n
