\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         A Point of Testimony\r\n\r\n                           by Carolyn Wells\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I\r\n\r\n\r\nBert Bayliss was the funniest detective you ever saw. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nleast like Vidocq, Lecoq or Sherlock, either in personality or\r\nmentality. And perhaps the chief difference lay in the fact that he\r\npossessed a sense of humor, and that not merely an appreciative sense,\r\neither. He had an original wit and a spontaneous repartee that made it\r\nwell-nigh impossible for him to be serious.\r\n\r\nNot quite, though, for he had his thinking moments; and when he did\r\nthink, he did it so deeply yet rapidly that he accomplished wonders.\r\n\r\nAnd so he was a detective. Partly because it pleased his sense of\r\nhumor to pursue a calling so incongruous with his birth and station,\r\nand partly because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, having been born one. He was a\r\nprivate detective, but none the less a professional; and he accepted\r\ncases only when they seemed especially difficult or in some way\r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case with those possessed of a strong sense of humor,\r\nBayliss had no very intimate friends. A proneness to fun always seems\r\nto preclude close friendships, and fortunately precludes also the\r\ndesire for them. But as every real detective needs a Dr. Watson as a\r\nsort of mind-servant, Bert Bayliss invented one, and his Harris (he\r\nchose the name in sincere flattery of Sairey Gamp) proved competent\r\nand satisfactory. To Harris Bayliss propounded his questions and\r\nexpounded his theories, and being merely a figment of Bayliss\xe2\x80\x99 brain,\r\nHarris was always able to give intelligent replies. Physically, too,\r\nyoung Bayliss was far from the regulation type of the prevalent\r\ndetective of fiction.\r\n\r\nNo aquiline nose was his, no sinister eyebrows, no expression of\r\nomniscience and inscrutability. Instead, he was a stalwart,\r\nlarge-framed young man, with a merry, even debonair face, and a\r\ngenial, magnetic glance. He was a man who inspired confidence by his\r\nfrankness, and whose twinkling eyes seemed to see the funny side of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThough having no close friendships, Bayliss had a wide circle of\r\nacquaintances, and was in frequent demand as a week-end visitor or a\r\ndinner guest. Wherefore, not being an early riser, the telephone at\r\nhis bedside frequently buzzed many times before he was up of a\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nEvery time that bell gave its rasping whir Bayliss felt an involuntary\r\nhope that it might be a call to an interesting case of detective work,\r\nand he was distinctly disappointed if it proved to be a mere social\r\nmessage. One morning just before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the bell wakened him\r\nfrom a light doze, and taking the receiver, he heard the voice of his\r\nold friend Martin Hopkins talking to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you at once,\xe2\x80\x9d the message came; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope nothing will prevent\r\nyour coming immediately. I am in Clearbrook. If you can catch the\r\nnine-thirty train from the City, I will meet you here at the station\r\nat ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There has been murder committed and we want your help.\r\nWill you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bayliss. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take the nine-thirty. Who is the\r\nvictim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard Hemmingway, my lifelong friend. I am a guest at his house.\r\nThe tragedy occurred last night, and I want you to get here before\r\nanything is touched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be there! good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d and hanging up the receiver, Bayliss\r\nproceeded to keep his word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Harris,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, silently, to his impalpable friend,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Hopkins is a gentleman of the old school and a man whom I\r\ngreatly admire. If he calls me to a case requiring detective\r\ninvestigation, you may be sure it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting affair and quite\r\nworthy of our attention. Eh, Harris?\xe2\x80\x9d The imaginary companion having\r\nagreed to this, Bayliss went calmly and expectantly on his way.\r\n\r\nAt the Clearbrook station he was met by Mr. Hopkins, who proposed that\r\nthey walk to the house in order that he might tell Bayliss some of the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hemmingway was my oldest and best friend,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Hopkins,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand, with my wife and daughter, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spending a few days at his\r\nhome. He was a widower, and his household includes his ward, Miss\r\nSheldon, his nephew, Everett Collins, a housekeeper, butler, and\r\nseveral under-servants. This morning at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the butler\r\ndiscovered the body of Mr. Hemmingway in his library, where the poor\r\nman had been strangled to death. Clapham, that\xe2\x80\x99s the butler, raised an\r\nalarm, at once, and ever since then the house has been full of\r\ndoctors, detectives and neighbors. We are almost there now, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you frankly, Bayliss, that I sent for you to look after my own\r\ninterests. You and I are good friends, and you\xe2\x80\x99re the best detective I\r\nknow. The evidence seems, so far, to point to some one in the house,\r\nand among those addle-pated, cocksure detectives now on the case it is\r\nnot impossible that I may myself be suspected of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bert Bayliss in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust that,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the old man, almost smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cHemmingway and I\r\nhave had large business transactions of late, and as a big bundle of\r\nsecurities has disappeared from his safe, it may look as if I had a\r\nhand in the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t quite take that seriously, Mr. Hopkins, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to\r\nlook into the case and perhaps I can give justice a boost in the right\r\ndirection. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no further hints to give me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the hints all point one way, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll discover that for\r\nyourself soon enough.\xe2\x80\x9d They walked together up the short path that led\r\nto the house of the late Richard Hemmingway.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClearbrook was a small settlement of well-to-do society people, who\r\nwished to live near but not in New York. The houses were rather\r\npretentious, with well-kept grounds, and picturesque flower-beds, but\r\nBert Bayliss paid little attention to the landscape as he hurried to\r\nthe Hemmingway mansion. Once in the drawing-room, Bayliss was\r\npresented by Mr. Hopkins to his wife and daughter, also to Miss\r\nSheldon and Mr. Collins.\r\n\r\nIt was surely a tribute to the young man that all these people, who\r\nwere fully prepared to treat the detective with a supercilious\r\nhauteur, were won at once by his affable and easy demeanor and\r\ninvoluntarily greeted him as a man of their own class and standing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Estey, the housekeeper, was also in the room, and at the moment\r\nof Bayliss\xe2\x80\x99 arrival, Coroner Spearman was about to begin his\r\npreliminary queries of investigation. Quite content to gain his\r\nknowledge of the case in this way, Bayliss settled himself to listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarris,\xe2\x80\x9d he said silently to his faithful friend, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are all\r\nrefined and sensitive people, but, excepting Mr. Hopkins, not one\r\nshows a deep or abiding grief at the death of this gentleman.\r\nTherefore I deduce that with most of them the loss is fully covered by\r\ninheritance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous, my dear Bayliss, marvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harris correctly.\r\n\r\nAt the command of the coroner, Clapham, the butler, was summoned to\r\ngive his account of the discovery of the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came down-stairs at twenty to six, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pompous but\r\ndeferential Englishman, \xe2\x80\x9cand it would be about six when I reached the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s library. The door was closed, and when I opened it I was\r\nsurprised to find one of the lamps still burning, the one by the desk,\r\nsir. By its light I could see the master still sitting in his chair.\r\nAt first I thought he had come down-stairs early, to do some work;\r\nthen I thought he had been working there all night; and then I thought\r\nmaybe something was wrong. These thoughts all flew through my mind in\r\nquick succession, sir, and, even as I thought them, I was raising the\r\nblinds. The daylight poured in, and I saw at once my master was dead,\r\nstrangled, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know he was strangled?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the coroner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, sir, his head was thrown back and I could see black marks on\r\nhis throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I called Mrs. Estey, who was already in the dining-room, and\r\nthen, at her advice, I went to Mr. Collins\xe2\x80\x99 door and knocked him\r\nawake. He hurried down-stairs, sir, and he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. Mr. Collins will be questioned later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bayliss silently to his friend, \xe2\x80\x9cthat coroner is no\r\nfool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is all the account of your finding of Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s body,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Mr. Spearman, \xe2\x80\x9ctell us now what you know of Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovements of last evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in his library all the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clapham. \xe2\x80\x9cHe went there\r\ndirectly after dinner, and gave me orders to admit three gentlemen\r\nthat he expected to call. He told me, sir, that I need not wait up to\r\nlet them out, as they would stay late, and he would see them to the\r\ndoor himself. The three gentlemen came, sir, between nine and ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. They came separately, and after I had shown the last one into\r\nMr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s library I did not go to the room again\xe2\x80\x94until this\r\nmorning. I went to bed, sir, at about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and at that time\r\nthey were still there, as I heard them talking when I left the\r\ndining-room, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood servant, Harris,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Bayliss; \xe2\x80\x9cif this household is\r\nbroken up, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have no trouble in finding a new situation and yet\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nhe just a trifle too fluent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris agreeably.\r\n\r\nMrs. Estey simply corroborated Clapham\xe2\x80\x99s story, and was followed by\r\nEverett Collins, who had been the next to appear upon the scene of the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nBayliss looked at this young man with interest. He was not of an\r\nattractive personality, though handsome and well set up. He had the\r\nphysical effects of an athlete, but his face was weak and his glance\r\nwas not straightforward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe impresses me as untrustworthy,\xe2\x80\x9d Bayliss confided to Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyet, confound the fellow, there\xe2\x80\x99s something about him I like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\nMr. Collins had little to say. He had been wakened by Clapham from a\r\nsound sleep and had hastily run down-stairs to find his uncle indeed\r\ndead, and evidently strangled. As to his own movements the night\r\nbefore, he had spent the evening out, had returned at about half-past\r\neleven, had let himself in with his latchkey and had gone to bed. He\r\nhad noticed that the library door was closed, and he could not say\r\nwhether any one was in the room or not.\r\n\r\nMiss Ruth Sheldon testified to the effect that she had played bridge\r\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins and Miss Ethel Hopkins until about eleven,\r\nwhen they had all retired. The Hopkins family corroborated this, and\r\nall agreed that they had heard no sound of any sort down-stairs after\r\nreaching their rooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s habit,\xe2\x80\x9d volunteered Miss Sheldon, \xe2\x80\x9cif he had\r\nlate callers, to let them out himself, to close the front door quietly\r\nafter them, and then to go up to his room with great care in order not\r\nto disturb any of us who might be asleep. He was most thoughtful of\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x99 comfort, always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe members of the household having been heard, Mr. Spearman turned\r\nhis attention to some others who sat in a group at a small table. One\r\nof these was the lawyer, Mr. Dunbar. He simply stated that he had full\r\ncharge of Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s legal affairs, and was prepared to make an\r\naccounting when required. But he added that his client\xe2\x80\x99s business with\r\nhim was not extensive, as the late financier was accustomed personally\r\nto look after all such matters as did not require actual legal\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nMr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s private secretary, George Fiske, testified that he\r\nwas in the habit of coming to Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s home every day from ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock to four. He had left as usual the day before, at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nand knew of nothing unusual regarding his employer or his business\r\nmatters at that time. Fiske had been sent for earlier than usual on\r\nthis particular morning but could throw no light on the affair. He\r\nknew the three men who called, and they were three of the richest and\r\nmost influential citizens of Clearbrook, who were more or less\r\nassociated with Mr. Hemmingway in some large financial interests. As a\r\nconfidential secretary, Mr. Fiske courteously but firmly declined to\r\ngo into details of these matters at present.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no reason to suspect any one whose name had been\r\nmentioned so far, and the coroner next turned his attention to the\r\npossibility of an intruder from outside, who had forced an entrance\r\nafter the three gentlemen had departed and before Mr. Hemmingway could\r\nhave left his library.\r\n\r\nBut investigation proved that the windows were all securely fastened\r\nand that the front door shut with a spring lock which could be opened\r\nonly from the outside by a latchkey. No one, save those who were\r\nalready accounted for, possessed a latchkey, and as no doors or\r\nwindows had been forced, it began to look to the coroner as if the\r\nevidence pointed to some one inside the house as the criminal.\r\n\r\nThe doctor declared that Mr. Hemmingway had died between twelve and\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock and the three men who had called, being asked over the\r\ntelephone, asserted that they left the house about midnight. One of\r\nthese, Mr. Carston, had tarried after the others and had talked a few\r\nmoments with Mr. Hemmingway at his door, but though this would seem to\r\nmake Mr. Carston the last person known to have had speech with the\r\ndead man, nobody dreamed for a moment of suspecting him. Bayliss\xe2\x80\x99 eyes\r\ntraveled over the assembled listeners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw,\xe2\x80\x9d he said silently to Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are too many suspects.\r\nGranting the criminal was in the house, it might have been any of the\r\nservants, any of the guests, the ward or the nephew. Every one of them\r\nhad opportunity, for, apparently, after midnight the callers were gone\r\nand every one in the house was sound asleep except the victim and the\r\ncriminal. But the fact of strangulation lets out Mrs. and Miss\r\nHopkins, who are too slender and delicate for such a deed. That big,\r\nathletic Miss Sheldon might have done it, had she been inclined; that\r\ngaunt, muscular housekeeper could have accomplished it; and as to the\r\nmen, young Collins, old Mr. Hopkins and that complacent butler are all\r\ncapable of the deed, physically. So, Harris, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the facts\r\nof the case, we\xe2\x80\x99ll now hunt for clues and theories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous, Bayliss, marvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d breathed Harris with deep admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n\r\nReaching the library, Bayliss found the Precinct Inspector busily\r\ngoing through the papers in Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s desk. Inspector Garson\r\nhad heard of the clever Bert Bayliss and was glad to meet him, though\r\na little embarrassed lest the city detective should look upon his own\r\nmethods as crude.\r\n\r\nWith the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s permission the body of the dead man had been\r\nremoved, but otherwise no changes had been made in the room. Bayliss\r\nglanced interestedly about. There were no signs of a struggle. The\r\nposition of several chairs showed the presence of callers who had\r\nevidently sat around in conversation with their host. The desk, though\r\nnot especially tidy, showed only the usual paraphernalia of a man of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBy themselves, in an open box, had been laid the articles taken from\r\nthe dead man\xe2\x80\x99s pockets. Bayliss looked at, without touching, the\r\nwatch, the bunch of keys, the knife, the pencil, the pile of small\r\ncoins and the handkerchiefs, which, together with a few papers,\r\ncomprised the contents of the box.\r\n\r\nThen Bayliss looked swiftly but minutely at the desk. The fittings of\r\nhandsome bronze were of uniform design and rather numerous. Every\r\nconvenience was there, from pen-rack to paste-pot. There were a great\r\nvariety of pens, pencils and paper-cutters, while many racks and files\r\nheld a profusion of stationery, cards and letters.\r\n\r\nYet everything was methodical; the plainly labeled packets of letters,\r\nthe carefully sorted bills and the neat memoranda here and there, all\r\nbetokened a systematic mind and a sense of orderly classification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe motive was, of course, robbery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Inspector, as several\r\nothers followed Bayliss into the library, \xe2\x80\x9cfor though everything else\r\nseems intact, a large bundle of securities, which Mr. Dunbar knows\r\nwere in Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s safe last Friday, are now gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those,\xe2\x80\x9d said George Fiske; \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you looked on those as\r\nmissing. I have them at my own rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have?\xe2\x80\x9d said the surprised Inspector. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not state that\r\nfact when interviewed by Mr. Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man frankly, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider that the\r\ntime or place to discuss Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s finances. I was his\r\nconfidential secretary, and though required to render an account at\r\nany time, I am careful not to do so prematurely. The bonds in question\r\nare at my home because Mr. Hemmingway gave them to me last Saturday to\r\nkeep for him temporarily. Here is a list of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFiske took a card of figures from his pocket-book and handed it to the\r\nInspector, who glanced at it with satisfaction and approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did quite right, Mr. Fiske,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m glad the\r\nsecurities are safe. But then what in your opinion could have been the\r\nmotive for the deed of last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFiske made no reply, but the expression on his face seemed to imply,\r\nagainst his will, that he could say something pertinent if he chose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight it not be, Harris,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Bayliss, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that young man\r\noverestimates the confidentialness of his secretaryship at this\r\ncrisis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Inspector was rapidly looking over a sheaf of opened\r\nletters, each of which bore at its top the rubber-stamped date of\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d he whistled, as he read one of these documents. He then looked\r\nfurtively at George Fiske, who was occupied with some clerical work\r\nwhich had to be done at once. Without a word Inspector Garson handed\r\nthe letter to Bert Bayliss, signifying by a gesture that he was to\r\nread it.\r\n\r\nAfter a glance at signature and date, Bayliss read the whole letter:\r\n\r\n                                               Sunday Afternoon,\r\n                                               September 9th.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Mr. Hemmingway:\r\n\r\n    After our talk of yesterday morning, I feel that I must\r\n    express more fully my appreciation of your declaration of\r\n    confidence in me, and my gratitude therefor. I was to\r\n    surprised when you asked me to act as executor of your\r\n    will that I fear I was awkward and disappointing in my\r\n    response. But, believe me, dear sir. I am deeply grateful\r\n    for your trust in me and I want to assure you that I will\r\n    perform all the duties of which you told me to the very\r\n    best of my ability, though I hope and pray the day is far\r\n    off when such need shall arise. I am not a fluent talker\r\n    and so take this means of telling you that a chord of my\r\n    nature was deeply touched when you asked me to assume such\r\n    a grave responsibility. I am, of course, at your service\r\n    for further discussion of these matters, but I felt I must\r\n    formally assure you of my gratitude for your kindness and\r\n    of my loyalty to your interests. As to the revelation you\r\n    made to me, it was so sudden and such a surprise, I can\r\n    not bear to think your suspicions are founded on the\r\n    truth; but as you requested, I will observe all I can\r\n    without seeming intrusive or curious. I have in safe\r\n    keeping the papers you entrusted to my care, and I hope\r\n    our present relations may continue for many happy years.\r\n\r\n                                            Faithfully yours,\r\n                                                    George Fiske.\r\n\r\nWith his usual quick eye for details, Bayliss noted that the letter\r\nwas dated two days before (that is, the day before the murder, which\r\noccurred Monday night); it was postmarked at the Clearbrook\r\npost-office Sunday-evening, and had therefore, been delivered to Mr.\r\nHemmingway by the first post Monday morning. This was corroborated by\r\nthe rubber-stamped line at the top of the first page, which read:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReceived, September 10.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter was among a lot labeled \xe2\x80\x9cTo be answered,\xe2\x80\x9d and it seemed to\r\nBayliss a very important document.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud to the Inspector, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we would be glad to\r\nhave Mr. Fiske tell us the circumstances that led to the writing of\r\nthis manly and straightforward letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Fiske looked up at the sound of his name. \xe2\x80\x9cHas that come to\r\nlight?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, blushing a little at being thus suddenly brought into\r\nprominence. \xe2\x80\x9cI supposed it would, but somehow I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to refer\r\nto it until some one else discovered it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bayliss, in his pleasant, chummy way, and\r\nat once Fiske began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast Saturday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hemmingway had a long talk with\r\nme. He expressed his satisfaction with my work as his secretary and\r\nkindly avowed his complete trust and confidence in my integrity. He\r\nthen asked me if I would be willing to act as executor of his estate,\r\nwhen the time should come that such a service was necessary. He said\r\nit was his intention to bring the whole matter before his lawyer in a\r\nfew days, but first he wished to be assured of my willingness to act\r\nas executor. He told me, too, that he would add a codicil to his will,\r\nleaving me a moderate sum of money. All of this was on Saturday\r\nmorning, and when I left at noon, as I always do on Saturdays, he gave\r\nme a large bundle of securities, and also his will, asking me to keep\r\nthem for him for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have his will, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Inspector Garson quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have; and also the bonds of which I have given you a memorandum.\r\nThey are all at your disposal at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Mr. Hemmingway died without adding the codicil to his will in\r\nyour favor,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Bayliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fiske, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is a minor matter in the face of the\r\npresent tragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBayliss felt slightly rebuked, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help admiring the manly\r\nway in which Fiske had spoken.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this conversation occurred on Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Mr. Garson. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ntook occasion to write to Mr. Hemmingway on Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Fiske. \xe2\x80\x9cI was so surprised at the whole thing that I\r\nwas unable to express myself at our interview. I am always tongue-tied\r\nunder stress of great surprise or excitement. So I sat down Sunday\r\nafternoon and wrote to Mr. Hemmingway. I mailed the letter Sunday\r\nevening and he had already received it when I reached here on Monday\r\nmorning, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he refer to your letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bayliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he said he was glad I wrote it, and that he would answer it on\r\npaper that I might also have his sentiments in black and white. Then\r\nhe said we would discuss the matter more fully after a day or two, and\r\nwe then turned our attention to other matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this revelation he made to you?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Inspector Garson,\r\nrunning his eyes over the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Fiske hesitated and looked not only embarrassed but genuinely\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, Mr. Garson, I want to be excused from telling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcused from telling! Why, man, it may help to elucidate the mystery\r\nof Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hope not, I hope not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fiske, so earnestly that both\r\nBayliss and the Inspector looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _do_ know something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Garson quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat may have a\r\nbearing on the mystery, and I must insist that you tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because it may _seem_ to have a bearing that I hesitate,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Fiske gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, to put it boldly, as I told you I am not\r\nfluent under stress of excitement; in a word, then, Mr. Hemmingway\r\nimplied to me, that\xe2\x80\x94that he had a half-defined fear that sometime his\r\nlife might\xe2\x80\x94might end suddenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the way it did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in that way. He feared that some one desired his death, and that\r\nwas the reason he asked me to care for his will and his valuable\r\nsecurities for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy were these things not in a safety deposit vault?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bert\r\nBayliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been; but a few days ago Mr. Hemmingway had them brought\r\nhome to make some records and changes, and as it was Saturday he could\r\nnot send them back then, so he gave them to me. I have a small safe at\r\nhome, and of course I was willing to keep them for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Mr. Hemmingway feared both robbery and murder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bayliss,\r\nand Mr. Fiske shuddered at this cold-blooded way of putting it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the secretary frankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom did he suspect as his enemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I hope you will allow me not to answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Mr. Fiske,\xe2\x80\x9d broke in the Inspector, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you have\r\nknowledge possessed by no one else. You must, therefore, in the\r\ninterests of justice, tell us the name of the man whom Mr. Hemmingway\r\nfeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man,\xe2\x80\x9dsaid George Fiske slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cis the one who inherits the bulk\r\nof Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverett Collins, his nephew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wife\xe2\x80\x99s nephew,\xe2\x80\x9d corrected George Fiske. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, since I am forced\r\nto tell it, Mr. Hemmingway feared that Mr. Collins was in haste to\r\ncome into his inheritance, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done your duty, Mr. Fiske,\xe2\x80\x9d said Inspector Garson, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nthank you. I quite appreciate your hesitancy, but a crime like this\r\nmust be punished, if possible, and you need not appear further in the\r\nmatter. After your evidence the law can take the whole affair into its\r\nown hands, and justice will be swift and certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law took its course. Although circumstantial evidence was lacking,\r\nthe statement of George Fiske and the undoubted opportunity and\r\nevident motive, combined, caused the arrest of Everett Collins.\r\n\r\nThe will, when produced, left nearly all the estate to him, and as he\r\nwas known to be a thriftless, improvident young man, the majority of\r\nthose interested felt convinced that he was indeed the villain.\r\n\r\nThe property of the late Mr. Hemmingway, however, was of far less\r\namount than was generally supposed, and also, the large fortune which\r\nhe had in trust for his ward, Miss Sheldon, had dwindled surprisingly.\r\nBut this, of course, was in no way the fault of the nephew, and it was\r\nthought that Mr. Hemmingway had perhaps been unfortunate in his\r\ninvestments. George Fiske became executor, as desired by the late\r\nmillionaire, but probate of the will was deferred until after Everett\r\nCollins should have been tried at the bar of justice.\r\n\r\nCollins himself was stubbornly quiet. He seemed rather dazed at the\r\nposition in which he found himself, but had nothing to say except a\r\nsimple assertion of his innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he _is_ innocent, Harris,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Bert Bayliss soundlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nvillain ever possessed that simple straightforward gaze. Villains are\r\ncomplex. That man may be a spendthrift and a ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-well, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nswear he\xe2\x80\x99s no murderer, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll prove it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous, Bayliss, marvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\nBayliss had come to Clearbrook on Tuesday, and on Wednesday Collins\r\nwas arrested.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday afternoon Bayliss shut himself up alone in the library to\r\nclue-hunt, as he called it. Acting on his conviction that Collins was\r\ninnocent, he eagerly sought for evidence in some other direction.\r\nSeating himself at Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s desk, he jotted down a few notes,\r\nusing for the purpose a pencil from the pen-tray in front of him.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe looked at the pencil abstractedly, and then he suddenly stared at\r\nit intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clue!\xe2\x80\x9d he said mentally to Harris. \xe2\x80\x9cHush, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak,\xe2\x80\x9d though\r\nHarris hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cI sure have a clue, but such a dinky one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the pencil as at a valuable curio. He glanced about the\r\ndesk for others, and found several. In a drawer he found many more.\r\nThey were all of the same make and same number, and while those on the\r\ndesk were all more or less well sharpened, those in the drawer had\r\nnever yet been cut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bayliss, and putting carefully into his pocket the pencil\r\nhe had used in making his notes, he began scrutinizing the\r\nwaste-basket.\r\n\r\nThere were not many torn papers in it, but the top ones were letters,\r\nenvelopes or circulars, each torn once across. On top of these were\r\nsome chips of pencil cedar and a trifle of black dust.\r\n\r\nAs if collecting precious treasure, Bayliss, with extreme care, lifted\r\nout the top layer of torn envelopes and, without disarranging the tiny\r\nwooden chips and black lead scrapings, laid all in a box, which he\r\nthen put in a small cupboard and, locking its door, put the key in his\r\npocket. Then he returned to the desk and picked up the packet of\r\nletters which had been received on Monday and from which Mr. Fiske\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter had been taken. There were about a dozen of them and he looked\r\nwith interest at each one. Every one was cut open the same way, not by\r\na letter-opener, but with shears\xe2\x80\x94a quick clean cut, which took off a\r\ntiny edge along the right-hand end. Each was stamped at the top with\r\nthe rubber \xe2\x80\x9cReceived\xe2\x80\x9d stamp in red ink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClever, clever villain!\xe2\x80\x9d mused Bayliss. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Harris, he\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nslickest ever! And nobody could have found him but Yours Truly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Harris.\r\n\r\nThen straight to Inspector Garson Bayliss marched and asked to see the\r\nletter that Mr. Fiske wrote to Mr. Hemmingway.\r\n\r\nReceiving it, he stared at it steadily for a moment, then, going to\r\nthe window, scrutinized it through a lens.\r\n\r\nMoved by an excitement which he strove not to show, he returned it to\r\nMr. Garson, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt, I suppose, as to the genuineness\r\nof that letter and all that it means and implies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Garson, looking straight at the young man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have wondered whether there could be anything wrong about Fiske,\r\nbut that letter is incontrovertible evidence of his veracity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be faked?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Bayliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Garson patiently, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s too real.\r\nWhether it was written Sunday or not, it was positively posted Sunday\r\nevening and it was positively delivered to Mr. Hemmingway Monday\r\nmorning. The postmark proves that. Then Mr. Hemmingway opened it, for\r\nit is cut open precisely the way he cuts open all his letters, and he\r\ndated it with his own dating-stamp, and put it with his lot \xe2\x80\x98To be\r\nanswered.\xe2\x80\x99 Can anything be more convincing of Fiske\xe2\x80\x99s good faith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bert Bayliss, \xe2\x80\x9cit _is_ a faked letter, and George\r\nFiske\xe2\x80\x99s the murderer of Richard Hemmingway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, what _do_ you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I say. Richard Hemmingway never saw this letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you prove that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can. Look at the envelope closely with this lens, in a strong\r\nlight. What do you see between the letters of Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Inspector peered closer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI see faint pencil-marks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you make out what they spell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98G-e-o\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94 _is_ it \xe2\x80\x98George Fiske\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, though not all the letters are discernible. Fiske wrote this\r\nletter on Sunday and mailed it on Sunday, _but_ \xe2\x80\x94he addressed it to\r\nhimself, _not_ to his employer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Garson in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen. He addressed it with a very soft pencil to himself, and\r\ntraced the address very lightly. It reached his boarding-house Monday\r\nmorning, of course, and then he erased the pencil-marks and boldly\r\nwrote Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s name in ink. Then he cut off the end, in\r\nprecisely the way Mr. Hemmingway opens his letters, and put the whole\r\nthing in his pocket. All day he carried it in his pocket (I am\r\nreconstructing this affair as it must have happened), and at four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock he went home with the missive still there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate Monday night he returned. After the three visitors had left, he\r\nstrangled Mr. Hemmingway. You know he\xe2\x80\x99s an athlete, and his employer\r\nwas a frail old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _then_ he used the rubber stamp on his own letter and tucked it\r\ninto the bunch of \xe2\x80\x98To be answered.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he rifled the safe, with Mr.\r\nHemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s own keys, turned off all the lights but one and swiftly\r\nand silently went home to bed. The rest you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bayliss, I can scarcely believe this!\xe2\x80\x9d said Inspector Garson,\r\nfairly gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it when the villain has written his own name\r\nas damning evidence against himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the inspector, again scrutinizing the faint trace\r\nof pencil-marks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why did he do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he wanted to be executor and thus be able to convert into\r\ncash the securities he has stolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe returned those.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a few. Oh, it was a clever and deep-laid scheme! Fiske has\r\nquantities of bonds and other valuable papers entirely unaccounted for\r\nand which, as sole executor, he can cash at his leisure, all unknown\r\nto any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you discover this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the simplest clue. I chanced to notice on Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s desk a\r\npencil, freshly sharpened, but sharpened in a totally different way\r\nfrom those sharpened by the man himself. I looked at all the other\r\npencils on his desk, at the one taken from his pocket and at one in\r\nhis bedroom\xe2\x80\x94they are all sharpened in exactly the same way, with\r\nnumerous long careful shaves, producing a whittled pyramid. The pencil\r\nI spoke of\xe2\x80\x94here it is\xe2\x80\x94is sharpened by only five strong, clean cuts,\r\nmaking a short exposure of cut wood, quite different from the long\r\npoint of wood in the others. Then I looked in the waste-basket, which\r\nat your orders had not been touched since the discovery of the crime,\r\nand _on top_ I found the chips and lead-dust of this very pencil. They\r\nwere _on top_ of some torn envelopes whose postmarks proved they had\r\ncome in Monday evening\xe2\x80\x99s mail, which reaches the Hemmingway house\r\nabout six-thirty. Hence, whoever sharpened that pencil did it _after_\r\nsix-thirty o\xe2\x80\x99clock Monday night, and _before_ the discovery of Mr.\r\nHemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s dead body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Garson listened breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Bayliss, \xe2\x80\x9cI looked around for some pencils\r\nsharpened like that, and found several on and in Fiske\xe2\x80\x99s desk in the\r\nlibrary. The pencil might have been borrowed from Fiske\xe2\x80\x99s desk, but it\r\nwas sharpened right there at Mr. Hemmingway\xe2\x80\x99s desk after half-past six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Fiske, as you know, testified that he left at four and did\r\nnot return until Tuesday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBayliss\xe2\x80\x99 deductions were true. Confronted suddenly with the story and\r\nwith the traced envelope, Fiske broke down completely and confessed\r\nall. He had been planning it for weeks, and had the decoy letter ready\r\nto use when Mr. Hemmingway should have a large amount of bonds in his\r\nown home safe. The whole story of the Saturday morning interview was a\r\nfigment of Fiske\xe2\x80\x99s fertile brain, and of course Mr. Hemmingway had no\r\nsuspicions of his nephew. Fiske had known of the expected callers, had\r\nwatched outside the house until the last one went away and then,\r\nrunning up the steps, had stopped Mr. Hemmingway just as he was\r\nclosing the door and requested a short interview. Innocently enough\r\nMr. Hemmingway took his secretary into the library, and, while waiting\r\nfor his fell opportunity, Fiske talked over some business matters.\r\nWhile making a memorandum, Mr. Hemmingway broke his pencil point, and,\r\nunthinkingly, Fiske obligingly sharpened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bayliss to Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cthat little act of\r\nordinary courtesy proved his undoing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvelous, Bayliss, marvelous!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\n                              THE END\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\xe2\x80\x99s Note: This story appeared in the October 1911 issue of\r\nAdventure magazine.]\r\n\r\n
