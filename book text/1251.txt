It is thus, fitly enough, the last important English book written\r\nbefore the introduction of printing into this country, and since no\r\nmanuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first English\r\nclassic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a\r\nprinted text. Caxton\xe2\x80\x99s story of how the book was brought to him and he\r\nwas induced to print it may be read farther on in his own preface. From\r\nthis we learn also that he was not only the printer of the book, but to\r\nsome extent its editor also, dividing Malory\xe2\x80\x99s work into twenty-one\r\nbooks, splitting up the books into chapters, by no means skilfully, and\r\nsupplying the \xe2\x80\x9cRubrish\xe2\x80\x9d or chapter-headings. It may be added that\r\nCaxton\xe2\x80\x99s preface contains, moreover, a brief criticism which, on the\r\npoints on which it touches, is still the soundest and most sympathetic\r\nthat has been written.\r\n\r\nCaxton finished his edition the last day of July 1485, some fifteen or\r\nsixteen years after Malory wrote his epilogue. It is clear that the\r\nauthor was then dead, or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy\r\neditor to the book, and recent discoveries (if bibliography may, for\r\nthe moment, enlarge its bounds to mention such matters) have revealed\r\nwith tolerable certainty when Malory died and who he was. In letters to\r\nThe Athenaeum in July 1896 Mr. T. Williams pointed out that the name of\r\na Sir Thomas Malorie occurred among those of a number of other\r\nLancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by Edward IV. in\r\n1468, and that a William Mallerye was mentioned in the same year as\r\ntaking part in a Lancastrian rising. In September 1897, again, in\r\nanother letter to the same paper, Mr. A. T. Martin reported the finding\r\nof the will of a Thomas Malory of Papworth, a hundred partly in\r\nCambridgeshire, partly in Hunts. This will was made on September 16,\r\n1469, and as it was proved the 27th of the next month the testator must\r\nhave been in immediate expectation of death. It contains the most\r\ncareful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of\r\nthree daughters and seven sons, of whom the youngest seems to have been\r\nstill an infant. We cannot say with certainty that this Thomas Malory,\r\nwhose last thoughts were so busy for his children, was our author, or\r\nthat the Lancastrian knight discovered by Mr. Williams was identical\r\nwith either or both, but such evidence as the Morte D\xe2\x80\x99Arthur offers\r\nfavours such a belief. There is not only the epilogue with its\r\npetition, \xe2\x80\x9cpray for me while I am alive that God send me good\r\ndeliverance and when I am dead pray you all for my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d but this very\r\nrequest is foreshadowed at the end of chap. 37 of Book ix. in the\r\ntouching passage, surely inspired by personal experience, as to the\r\nsickness \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the greatest pain a prisoner may have\xe2\x80\x9d; and the\r\nreflections on English fickleness in the first chapter of Book xxi.,\r\nthough the Wars of the Roses might have inspired them in any one, come\r\nmost naturally from an author who was a Lancastrian knight.\r\n\r\nIf the Morte D\xe2\x80\x99Arthur was really written in prison and by a prisoner\r\ndistressed by ill-health as well as by lack of liberty, surely no task\r\nwas ever better devised to while away weary hours. Leaving abundant\r\nscope for originality in selection, modification, and arrangement, as a\r\ncompilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which\r\nadds the touch of restfulness to literary work. No original, it is\r\nsaid, has yet been found for Book vii., and it is possible that none\r\nwill ever be forthcoming for chap. 20 of Book xviii., which describes\r\nthe arrival of the body of the Fair Maiden of Astolat at Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt, or vii for chap. 25 of the same book, with its discourse on true\r\nlove; but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x9cMerlin\xe2\x80\x9d of Robert de Borron and his successors (Bks. i.-iv.),\r\nthe English metrical romance La Morte Arthur of the Thornton manuscript\r\n(Bk. v.), the French romances of Tristan (Bks. viii.-x.) and of\r\nLauncelot (Bks. vi., xi.-xix.), and lastly to the English prose Morte\r\nArthur of Harley MS. 2252 (Bks. xviii., xx., xxi.). As to Malory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchoice of his authorities critics have not failed to point out that now\r\nand again he gives a worse version where a better has come down to us,\r\nand if he had been able to order a complete set of Arthurian\r\nmanuscripts from his bookseller, no doubt he would have done even\r\nbetter than he did! But of the skill, approaching to original genius,\r\nwith which he used the books from which he worked there is little\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nMalory died leaving his work obviously unrevised, and in this condition\r\nit was brought to Caxton, who prepared it for the press with his usual\r\nenthusiasm in the cause of good literature, and also, it must be added,\r\nwith his usual carelessness. New chapters are sometimes made to begin\r\nin the middle of a sentence, and in addition to simple misprints there\r\nare numerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have\r\nthe text as Malory intended it to stand. After Caxton\xe2\x80\x99s edition\r\nMalory\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript must have disappeared, and subsequent editions are\r\ndifferentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow\r\nthe first. Editions appeared printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 and\r\n1529, by William Copland in 1559, by Thomas East about 1585, and by\r\nThomas Stansby in 1634, each printer apparently taking the text of his\r\nimmediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications. Stansby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedition served for reprints in 1816 and 1856 (the latter edited by\r\nThomas Wright); but in 1817 an edition supervised by Robert Southey\r\nwent back to Caxton\xe2\x80\x99s text, though to a copy (only two are extant, and\r\nonly one perfect!) in which eleven leaves were supplied from Wynkyn de\r\nWorde\xe2\x80\x99s reprint. In 1868 Sir Edward Strachey produced for the present\r\npublishers a reprint of Southey\xe2\x80\x99s text in modern spelling, with the\r\nsubstitution of current words for those now obsolete, and the softening\r\nof a handful of passages likely, he thought, to prevent the book being\r\nplaced in the hands of boys. In 1889 a boon was conferred on scholars\r\nby the publication of Dr. H. Oskar Sommer\xe2\x80\x99s page-for-page reprint of\r\nCaxton\xe2\x80\x99s text, with an elaborate discussion of Malory\xe2\x80\x99s sources. Dr.\r\nSommer\xe2\x80\x99s edition was used by Sir E. Strachey to revise his Globe text,\r\nand in 1897 Mr. Israel Gollancz produced for the \xe2\x80\x9cTemple Classics\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nvery pretty edition in which Sir Edward Strachey\xe2\x80\x99s principles of\r\nmodernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted, but with the\r\nrestoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases. As to the present\r\nedition, Sir Edward Strachey altered with so sparing a hand that on\r\nmany pages differences between his version and that here printed will\r\nbe looked for in vain; but the most anxious care has been taken to\r\nproduce a text modernised as to its spelling, but in other respects in\r\naccurate accordance with Caxton\xe2\x80\x99s text, as represented by Dr Sommer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreprint. Obvious misprints have been silently corrected, but in a few\r\ncases notes show where emendations have been introduced from Wynkyn de\r\nWorde\xe2\x80\x94not that Wynkyn had any more right to emend Caxton than we, but\r\nbecause even a printer\xe2\x80\x99s conjecture gains a little sanctity after four\r\ncenturies. The restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much\r\nfuller glossary, and the index of names has therefore been separated\r\nfrom it and enlarged. In its present form the index is the work of Mr.\r\nHenry Littlehales.\r\n\r\nA. W. POLLARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE OF WILLIAM CAXTON\r\n\r\nAfter that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well of\r\ncontemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great\r\nconquerors and princes, and also certain books of ensamples and\r\ndoctrine, many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England came\r\nand demanded me many and oft times, wherefore that I have not do made\r\nand imprint the noble history of the Saint Greal, and of the most\r\nrenowned Christian king, first and chief of the three best Christian,\r\nand worthy, King Arthur, which ought most to be remembered among us\r\nEnglishmen to-fore all other Christian kings; for it is notoyrly known\r\nthrough the universal world, that there be nine worthy and the best\r\nthat ever were, that is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews, and three\r\nChristian men. As for the Paynims, they were to-fore the Incarnation of\r\nChrist, which were named, the first Hector of Troy, of whom the history\r\nis comen both in ballad and in prose, the second Alexander the Great,\r\nand the third Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, of whom the histories be\r\nwell known and had. And as for the three Jews, which also were to-fore\r\nthe incarnation of our Lord, of whom the first was duke Joshua which\r\nbrought the children of Israel into the land of behest, the second\r\nDavid king of Jerusalem, and the third Judas Machabeus, of these three\r\nthe Bible rehearseth all their noble histories and acts. And since the\r\nsaid Incarnation have been three noble Christian men, stalled and\r\nadmitted through the universal world into the number of the nine best\r\nand worthy. Of whom was first the noble Arthur, whose noble acts I\r\npurpose to write in this present book here following. The second was\r\nCharlemain, or Charles the Great, of whom the history is had in many\r\nplaces, both in French and in English. And the third and last was\r\nGodfrey of Boloine, of whose acts and life I made a book unto the\r\nexcellent prince and king of noble memory, King Edward the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThe said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history\r\nof the said noble king and conqueror King Arthur, and of his knights,\r\nwith the history of the Saint Greal, and of the death and ending of the\r\nsaid Arthur; affirming that I ought rather to imprint his acts and\r\nnoble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of the other eight,\r\nconsidering that he was a man born within this realm, and king and\r\nemperor of the same: and that there be in French divers and many noble\r\nvolumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I answered that\r\ndivers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that all\r\nsuch books as been made of him be feigned and fables, because that some\r\nchronicles make of him no mention, nor remember him nothing, nor of his\r\nknights. Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him\r\nthat should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur\r\nmight well be aretted great folly and blindness. For he said that there\r\nwere many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see his sepulchre in\r\nthe monastery of Glastonbury. And also in Policronicon, in the fifth\r\nbook the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third\r\nchapter, where his body was buried, and after found, and translated\r\ninto the said monastery. Ye shall see also in the history of Bochas, in\r\nhis book De Casu Principum, part of his noble acts, and also of his\r\nfall. Also Galfridus in his British book recounteth his life: and in\r\ndivers places of England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall\r\nremain perpetually, and also of his knights. First in the abbey of\r\nWestminster, at St. Edward\xe2\x80\x99s shrine, remaineth the print of his seal in\r\nred wax closed in beryl, in which is written, Patricius Arthurus\r\nBritannie, Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator. Item in the castle of\r\nDover ye may see Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s skull, and Cradok\xe2\x80\x99s mantle: at Winchester\r\nthe Round Table: in other places Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s sword and many other\r\nthings. Then all these things considered, there can no man reasonably\r\ngainsay but there was a king of this land named Arthur. For in all\r\nplaces, Christian and heathen, he is reputed and taken for one of the\r\nnine worthy, and the first of the three Christian men. And also, he is\r\nmore spoken of beyond the sea, more books made of his noble acts, than\r\nthere be in England, as well in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish,\r\nas in French. And yet of record remain in witness of him in Wales, in\r\nthe town of Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous works of iron\r\nlying under the ground, and royal vaults, which divers now living have\r\nseen. Wherefore it is a marvel why he is no more renowned in his own\r\ncountry, save only it accordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no\r\nman is accepted for a prophet in his own country.\r\n\r\nThen all these things aforesaid alleged, I could not well deny but that\r\nthere was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine\r\nworthy, and first and chief of the Christian men. And many noble\r\nvolumes be made of him and of his noble knights in French, which I have\r\nseen and read beyond the sea, which be not had in our maternal tongue.\r\nBut in Welsh be many and also in French, and some in English but\r\nnowhere nigh all. Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly\r\ninto English I have after the simple conning that God hath sent to me,\r\nunder the favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen,\r\nenprised to imprint a book of the noble histories of the said King\r\nArthur, and of certain of his knights, after a copy unto me delivered,\r\nwhich copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of French,\r\nand reduced it into English. And I, according to my copy, have done set\r\nit in imprint, to the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble\r\nacts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used\r\nin those days, by which they came to honour, and how they that were\r\nvicious were punished and oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly\r\nbeseeching all noble lords and ladies, with all other estates of what\r\nestate or degree they been of, that shall see and read in this said\r\nbook and work, that they take the good and honest acts in their\r\nremembrance, and to follow the same. Wherein they shall find many\r\njoyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity,\r\ngentleness, and chivalry. For herein may be seen noble chivalry,\r\ncourtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship,\r\ncowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the good and leave\r\nthe evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown. And for to\r\npass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in, but for to give\r\nfaith and belief that all is true that is contained herein, ye be at\r\nyour liberty: but all is written for our doctrine, and for to beware\r\nthat we fall not to vice nor sin, but to exercise and follow virtue, by\r\nwhich we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life, and\r\nafter this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss in\r\nheaven; the which He grant us that reigneth in heaven, the blessed\r\nTrinity. Amen.\r\n\r\nThen to proceed forth in this said book, which I direct unto all noble\r\nprinces, lords and ladies, gentlemen or gentlewomen, that desire to\r\nread or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great\r\nconqueror and excellent king, King Arthur, sometime king of this noble\r\nrealm, then called Britain; I, William Caxton, simple person, present\r\nthis book following, which I have enprised to imprint: and treateth of\r\nthe noble acts, feats of arms of chivalry, prowess, hardiness,\r\nhumanity, love, courtesy, and very gentleness, with many wonderful\r\nhistories and adventures.

First, How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and\r\nIgraine his wife, and of their departing suddenly again.\r\n\r\nIt befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all\r\nEngland, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that\r\nheld war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of\r\nTintagil. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him\r\nto bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a\r\npassing wise, and her name was called Igraine.\r\n\r\nSo when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of\r\ngreat lords they were accorded both. The king liked and loved this lady\r\nwell, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have\r\nlain by her. But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent\r\nunto the king. And then she told the duke her husband, and said, I\r\nsuppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore,\r\nhusband, I counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may\r\nride all night unto our own castle. And in like wise as she said so\r\nthey departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware\r\nof their departing. All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing\r\nso suddenly, he was wonderly wroth. Then he called to him his privy\r\ncouncil, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nThen they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great\r\ncharge; and if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your\r\nbest, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him. So that was done,\r\nand the messengers had their answers; and that was this shortly, that\r\nneither he nor his wife would not come at him.\r\n\r\nThen was the king wonderly wroth. And then the king sent him plain word\r\nagain, and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish him, for within\r\nforty days he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he hath.\r\n\r\nWhen the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and\r\ngarnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight\r\nTintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine\r\nhe put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he put in the castle of\r\nTerrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out. Then in all haste\r\ncame Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of\r\nTerrabil. And there he pight many pavilions, and there was great war\r\nmade on both parties, and much people slain. Then for pure anger and\r\nfor great love of fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick. So came to the\r\nking Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he was\r\nsick. I shall tell thee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for\r\nlove of fair Igraine, that I may not be whole. Well, my lord, said Sir\r\nUlfius, I shall seek Merlin, and he shall do you remedy, that your\r\nheart shall be pleased. So Ulfius departed, and by adventure he met\r\nMerlin in a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s array, and there Merlin asked Ulfius whom he\r\nsought. And he said he had little ado to tell him. Well, said Merlin, I\r\nknow whom thou seekest, for thou seekest Merlin; therefore seek no\r\nfarther, for I am he; and if King Uther will well reward me, and be\r\nsworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be his honour and profit\r\nmore than mine; for I shall cause him to have all his desire. All this\r\nwill I undertake, said Ulfius, that there shall be nothing reasonable\r\nbut thou shalt have thy desire. Well, said Merlin, he shall have his\r\nintent and desire. And therefore, said Merlin, ride on your way, for I\r\nwill not be long behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How Uther Pendragon made war on the duke of Cornwall, and\r\nhow by the mean of Merlin he lay by the duchess and gat Arthur.\r\n\r\nThen Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he came to\r\nKing Uther Pendragon, and told him he had met with Merlin. Where is he?\r\nsaid the king. Sir, said Ulfius, he will not dwell long. Therewithal\r\nUlfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\nAnd then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When King Uther saw him,\r\nhe said he was welcome. Sir, said Merlin, I know all your heart every\r\ndeal; so ye will be sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to\r\nfulfil my desire, ye shall have your desire. Then the king was sworn\r\nupon the Four Evangelists. Sir, said Merlin, this is my desire: the\r\nfirst night that ye shall lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her,\r\nand when that is born, that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish\r\nthere as I will have it; for it shall be your worship, and the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\navail, as mickle as the child is worth. I will well, said the king, as\r\nthou wilt have it. Now make you ready, said Merlin, this night ye shall\r\nlie with Igraine in the castle of Tintagil; and ye shall be like the\r\nduke her husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s, and I will be like a knight that hight Sir Jordanus, a knight\r\nof the duke\xe2\x80\x99s. But wait ye make not many questions with her nor her\r\nmen, but say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on\r\nthe morn till I come to you, for the castle of Tintagil is but ten\r\nmiles hence; so this was done as they devised. But the duke of Tintagil\r\nespied how the king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that\r\nnight he issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s host. And so, through his own issue, the duke himself was\r\nslain or ever the king came at the castle of Tintagil.\r\n\r\nSo after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than\r\nthree hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur, and on\r\nday came Merlin to the king, and bade him make him ready, and so he\r\nkissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste. But when the lady\r\nheard tell of the duke her husband, and by all record he was dead or\r\never King Uther came to her, then she marvelled who that might be that\r\nlay with her in likeness of her lord; so she mourned privily and held\r\nher peace. Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord\r\nbetwixt the lady Igraine and him; the king gave them leave, for fain\r\nwould he have been accorded with her. So the king put all the trust in\r\nUlfius to entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king\r\nand she met together. Now will we do well, said Ulfius, our king is a\r\nlusty knight and wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady;\r\nit were great joy unto us all, an it might please the king to make her\r\nhis queen. Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king.\r\nAnd anon, like a lusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and\r\nso in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nAnd King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was\r\nGawaine\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.\r\nAll this was done at the request of King Uther. And the third sister\r\nMorgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she learned so\r\nmuch that she was a great clerk of necromancy. And after she was wedded\r\nto King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Ewain\xe2\x80\x99s le\r\nBlanchemain\xe2\x80\x99s father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. Of the birth of King Arthur and of his nurture.\r\n\r\nThen Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell after\r\nwithin half a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her, by\r\nthe faith she owed to him, whose was the body; then she sore abashed to\r\ngive answer. Dismay you not, said the king, but tell me the truth, and\r\nI shall love you the better, by the faith of my body. Sir, said she, I\r\nshall tell you the truth. The same night that my lord was dead, the\r\nhour of his death, as his knights record, there came into my castle of\r\nTintagil a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two\r\nknights with him in likeness of his two knights Brastias and Jordanus,\r\nand so I went unto bed with him as I ought to do with my lord, and the\r\nsame night, as I shall answer unto God, this child was begotten upon\r\nme. That is truth, said the king, as ye say; for it was I myself that\r\ncame in the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father of\r\nthe child; and there he told her all the cause, how it was by Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncounsel. Then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the father\r\nof her child.\r\n\r\nSoon came Merlin unto the king, and said, Sir, ye must purvey you for\r\nthe nourishing of your child. As thou wilt, said the king, be it. Well,\r\nsaid Merlin, I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a passing\r\ntrue man and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of your\r\nchild, and his name is Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair livelihood\r\nin many parts in England and Wales; and this lord, Sir Ector, let him\r\nbe sent for, for to come and speak with you, and desire him yourself,\r\nas he loveth you, that he will put his own child to nourishing to\r\nanother woman, and that his wife nourish yours. And when the child is\r\nborn let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened. So\r\nlike as Merlin devised it was done. And when Sir Ector was come he made\r\nfiaunce to the king for to nourish the child like as the king desired;\r\nand there the king granted Sir Ector great rewards. Then when the lady\r\nwas delivered, the king commanded two knights and two ladies to take\r\nthe child, bound in a cloth of gold, and that ye deliver him to what\r\npoor man ye meet at the postern gate of the castle. So the child was\r\ndelivered unto Merlin, and so he bare it forth unto Sir Ector, and made\r\nan holy man to christen him, and named him Arthur; and so Sir Ector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife nourished him with her own pap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. Of the death of King Uther Pendragon.\r\n\r\nThen within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady. And in\r\nthe meanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon\r\nhis men, and slew many of his people. Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie\r\nso as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an\r\nhorse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if\r\nyour person be there, and then shall ye have the victory. So it was\r\ndone as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an\r\nhorse-litter with a great host towards his enemies. And at St. Albans\r\nthere met with the king a great host of the North. And that day Sir\r\nUlfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther\xe2\x80\x99s men\r\novercame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant\r\nto flight. And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy\r\nof his victory. And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days\r\nand three nights he was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great\r\nsorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best. There is none other\r\nremedy, said Merlin, but God will have his will. But look ye all barons\r\nbe before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him to speak. So\r\non the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king; then\r\nMerlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king\r\nafter your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance? Then Uther\r\nPendragon turned him, and said in hearing of them all, I give him God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, and righteously and\r\nworshipfully that he claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing;\r\nand therewith he yielded up the ghost, and then was he interred as\r\nlonged to a king. Wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow,\r\nand all the barons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a\r\nsword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThen stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that\r\nwas mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been king.\r\nThen Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him\r\nfor to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of\r\narms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of\r\ncursing; and for this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night,\r\nthat he would of his great mercy show some miracle, as he was come to\r\nbe king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise\r\nking of this realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent\r\nfor all the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by\r\nChristmas even unto London. And many of them made them clean of their\r\nlife, that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God. So in\r\nthe greatest church of London, whether it were Paul\xe2\x80\x99s or not the French\r\nbook maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church\r\nfor to pray. And when matins and the first mass was done, there was\r\nseen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four\r\nsquare, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an\r\nanvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by\r\nthe point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that\r\nsaid thus:\xe2\x80\x94Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is\r\nrightwise king born of all England. Then the people marvelled, and told\r\nit to the Archbishop.\r\n\r\nI command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you within your church and\r\npray unto God still, that no man touch the sword till the high mass be\r\nall done. So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the\r\nstone and the sword. And when they saw the scripture some assayed, such\r\nas would have been king. But none might stir the sword nor move it. He\r\nis not here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the sword, but\r\ndoubt not God will make him known. But this is my counsel, said the\r\nArchbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they\r\nto keep this sword. So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry,\r\nthat every man should assay that would, for to win the sword. And upon\r\nNew Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that all\r\nknights that would joust or tourney there might play, and all this was\r\nordained for to keep the lords together and the commons, for the\r\nArchbishop trusted that God would make him known that should win the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nSo upon New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto\r\nthe field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happened that\r\nSir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the\r\njousts, and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and young Arthur that was\r\nhis nourished brother; and Sir Kay was made knight at All Hallowmass\r\nafore. So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for\r\nhe had left it at his father\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur\r\nfor to ride for his sword. I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast\r\nafter the sword, and when he came home, the lady and all were out to\r\nsee the jousting. Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will\r\nride to the churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the\r\nstone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day. So\r\nwhen he came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his horse\r\nto the stile, and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there,\r\nfor they were at the jousting. And so he handled the sword by the\r\nhandles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took\r\nhis horse and rode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and\r\ndelivered him the sword. And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist\r\nwell it was the sword of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir\r\nEctor, and said: Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I\r\nmust be king of this land. When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned\r\nagain and came to the church, and there they alighted all three, and\r\nwent into the church. And anon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he\r\ncame to that sword. Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he\r\nbrought it to me. How gat ye this sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur. Sir,\r\nI will tell you. When I came home for my brother\xe2\x80\x99s sword, I found\r\nnobody at home to deliver me his sword; and so I thought my brother Sir\r\nKay should not be swordless, and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it\r\nout of the stone without any pain. Found ye any knights about this\r\nsword? said Sir Ector. Nay, said Arthur. Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur,\r\nI understand ye must be king of this land. Wherefore I, said Arthur,\r\nand for what cause? Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so; for there\r\nshould never man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be\r\nrightwise king of this land. Now let me see whether ye can put the\r\nsword there as it was, and pull it out again. That is no mastery, said\r\nArthur, and so he put it in the stone; wherewithal Sir Ector assayed to\r\npull out the sword and failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur pulled out the sword divers times.\r\n\r\nNow assay, said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay. And anon he pulled at the sword\r\nwith all his might; but it would not be. Now shall ye assay, said Sir\r\nEctor to Arthur. I will well, said Arthur, and pulled it out easily.\r\nAnd therewithal Sir Ector knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay. Alas,\r\nsaid Arthur, my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me? Nay,\r\nnay, my lord Arthur, it is not so; I was never your father nor of your\r\nblood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were.\r\nAnd then Sir Ector told him all, how he was betaken him for to nourish\r\nhim, and by whose commandment, and by Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s deliverance.\r\n\r\nThen Arthur made great dole when he understood that Sir Ector was not\r\nhis father. Sir, said Ector unto Arthur, will ye be my good and\r\ngracious lord when ye are king? Else were I to blame, said Arthur, for\r\nye are the man in the world that I am most beholden to, and my good\r\nlady and mother your wife, that as well as her own hath fostered me and\r\nkept. And if ever it be God\xe2\x80\x99s will that I be king as ye say, ye shall\r\ndesire of me what I may do, and I shall not fail you; God forbid I\r\nshould fail you Sir, said Sir Ector, I will ask no more of you, but\r\nthat ye will make my son, your foster brother, Sir Kay, seneschal of\r\nall your lands. That shall be done, said Arthur, and more, by the faith\r\nof my body, that never man shall have that office but he, while he and\r\nI live. Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop, and told him how the\r\nsword was achieved, and by whom; and on Twelfth-day all the barons came\r\nthither, and to assay to take the sword, who that would assay. But\r\nthere afore them all, there might none take it out but Arthur;\r\nwherefore there were many lords wroth, and said it was great shame unto\r\nthem all and the realm, to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood\r\nborn. And so they fell out at that time that it was put off till\r\nCandlemas and then all the barons should meet there again; but always\r\nthe ten knights were ordained to watch the sword day and night, and so\r\nthey set a pavilion over the stone and the sword, and five always\r\nwatched. So at Candlemas many more great lords came thither for to have\r\nwon the sword, but there might none prevail. And right as Arthur did at\r\nChristmas, he did at Candlemas, and pulled out the sword easily,\r\nwhereof the barons were sore aggrieved and put it off in delay till the\r\nhigh feast of Easter. And as Arthur sped before, so did he at Easter;\r\nyet there were some of the great lords had indignation that Arthur\r\nshould be king, and put it off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.\r\n\r\nThen the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s providence let purvey\r\nthen of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther\r\nPendragon loved best and most trusted in his days. And such knights\r\nwere put about Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius,\r\nSir Brastias. All these, with many other, were always about Arthur, day\r\nand night, till the feast of Pentecost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How King Arthur was crowned, and how he made officers.\r\n\r\nAnd at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull at the\r\nsword that would assay; but none might prevail but Arthur, and pulled\r\nit out afore all the lords and commons that were there, wherefore all\r\nthe commons cried at once, We will have Arthur unto our king, we will\r\nput him no more in delay, for we all see that it is God\xe2\x80\x99s will that he\r\nshall be our king, and who that holdeth against it, we will slay him.\r\nAnd therewithal they kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried\r\nArthur mercy because they had delayed him so long, and Arthur forgave\r\nthem, and took the sword between both his hands, and offered it upon\r\nthe altar where the Archbishop was, and so was he made knight of the\r\nbest man that was there. And so anon was the coronation made. And there\r\nwas he sworn unto his lords and the commons for to be a true king, to\r\nstand with true justice from thenceforth the days of this life. Also\r\nthen he made all lords that held of the crown to come in, and to do\r\nservice as they ought to do. And many complaints were made unto Sir\r\nArthur of great wrongs that were done since the death of King Uther, of\r\nmany lands that were bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen.\r\nWherefore King Arthur made the lands to be given again unto them that\r\nowned them.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, that the king had stablished all the countries\r\nabout London, then he let make Sir Kay seneschal of England; and Sir\r\nBaudwin of Britain was made constable; and Sir Ulfius was made\r\nchamberlain; and Sir Brastias was made warden to wait upon the north\r\nfrom Trent forwards, for it was that time the most party the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenemies. But within few years after Arthur won all the north, Scotland,\r\nand all that were under their obeissance. Also Wales, a part of it,\r\nheld against Arthur, but he overcame them all, as he did the remnant,\r\nthrough the noble prowess of himself and his knights of the Round\r\nTable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How King Arthur held in Wales, at a Pentecost, a great\r\nfeast, and what kings and lords came to his feast.\r\n\r\nThen the king removed into Wales, and let cry a great feast that it\r\nshould be holden at Pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city\r\nof Carlion. Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with\r\nfive hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast King Uriens\r\nof Gore with four hundred knights with him. Also there came to that\r\nfeast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him. Also\r\nthere came to the feast the king of Scotland with six hundred knights\r\nwith him, and he was but a young man. Also there came to the feast a\r\nking that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he and his\r\nmen were passing well beseen at all points. Also there came the king of\r\nCarados with five hundred knights. And King Arthur was glad of their\r\ncoming, for he weened that all the kings and knights had come for great\r\nlove, and to have done him worship at his feast; wherefore the king\r\nmade great joy, and sent the kings and knights great presents. But the\r\nkings would none receive, but rebuked the messengers shamefully, and\r\nsaid they had no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless boy that was\r\ncome of low blood, and sent him word they would none of his gifts, but\r\nthat they were come to give him gifts with hard swords betwixt the neck\r\nand the shoulders: and therefore they came thither, so they told to the\r\nmessengers plainly, for it was great shame to all them to see such a\r\nboy to have a rule of so noble a realm as this land was. With this\r\nanswer the messengers departed and told to King Arthur this answer.\r\nWherefore, by the advice of his barons, he took him to a strong tower\r\nwith five hundred good men with him. And all the kings aforesaid in a\r\nmanner laid a siege to-fore him, but King Arthur was well victualed.\r\nAnd within fifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of\r\nCarlion. Then all the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him,\r\nFor what cause is that boy Arthur made your king? Sirs, said Merlin, I\r\nshall tell you the cause, for he is King Uther Pendragon\xe2\x80\x99s son, born in\r\nwedlock, gotten on Igraine, the duke\xe2\x80\x99s wife of Tintagil. Then is he a\r\nbastard, they said all. Nay, said Merlin, after the death of the duke,\r\nmore than three hours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after\r\nKing Uther wedded Igraine; and therefore I prove him he is no bastard.\r\nAnd who saith nay, he shall be king and overcome all his enemies; and,\r\nor he die, he shall be long king of all England, and have under his\r\nobeissance Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will\r\nnow rehearse. Some of the kings had marvel of Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s words, and\r\ndeemed well that it should be as he said; and some of them laughed him\r\nto scorn, as King Lot; and more other called him a witch. But then were\r\nthey accorded with Merlin, that King Arthur should come out and speak\r\nwith the kings, and to come safe and to go safe, such surance there was\r\nmade. So Merlin went unto King Arthur, and told him how he had done,\r\nand bade him fear not, but come out boldly and speak with them, and\r\nspare them not, but answer them as their king and chieftain; for ye\r\nshall overcome them all, whether they will or nill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. Of the first war that King Arthur had, and how he won the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThen King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a\r\njesseraunt of double mail, and there went with him the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias:\r\nthese were the men of most worship that were with him. And when they\r\nwere met there was no meekness, but stout words on both sides; but\r\nalways King Arthur answered them, and said he would make them to bow an\r\nhe lived. Wherefore they departed with wrath, and King Arthur bade keep\r\nthem well, and they bade the king keep him well. So the king returned\r\nhim to the tower again and armed him and all his knights. What will ye\r\ndo? said Merlin to the kings; ye were better for to stint, for ye shall\r\nnot here prevail though ye were ten times so many. Be we well advised\r\nto be afeared of a dream-reader? said King Lot. With that Merlin\r\nvanished away, and came to King Arthur, and bade him set on them\r\nfiercely; and in the meanwhile there were three hundred good men, of\r\nthe best that were with the kings, that went straight unto King Arthur,\r\nand that comforted him greatly. Sir, said Merlin to Arthur, fight not\r\nwith the sword that ye had by miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the\r\nworse, then draw it out and do your best. So forthwithal King Arthur\r\nset upon them in their lodging. And Sir Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir\r\nBrastias slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was\r\nmarvel; and always King Arthur on horseback laid on with a sword, and\r\ndid marvellous deeds of arms, that many of the kings had great joy of\r\nhis deeds and hardiness.\r\n\r\nThen King Lot brake out on the back side, and the King with the Hundred\r\nKnights, and King Carados, and set on Arthur fiercely behind him. With\r\nthat Sir Arthur turned with his knights, and smote behind and before,\r\nand ever Sir Arthur was in the foremost press till his horse was slain\r\nunderneath him. And therewith King Lot smote down King Arthur. With\r\nthat his four knights received him and set him on horseback. Then he\r\ndrew his sword Excalibur, but it was so bright in his enemies\xe2\x80\x99 eyes,\r\nthat it gave light like thirty torches. And therewith he put them\r\na-back, and slew much people. And then the commons of Carlion arose\r\nwith clubs and staves and slew many knights; but all the kings held\r\nthem together with their knights that were left alive, and so fled and\r\ndeparted. And Merlin came unto Arthur, and counselled him to follow\r\nthem no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How Merlin counselled King Arthur to send for King Ban and\r\nKing Bors, and of their counsel taken for the war.\r\n\r\nSo after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him unto London, and\r\nso by the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his barons to council,\r\nfor Merlin had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him\r\nwould in all haste be awroke on him and on his lands. Wherefore the\r\nking asked counsel at them all. They could no counsel give, but said\r\nthey were big enough. Ye say well, said Arthur; I thank you for your\r\ngood courage, but will ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin? ye know\r\nwell that he hath done much for me, and he knoweth many things, and\r\nwhen he is afore you, I would that ye prayed him heartily of his best\r\nadvice. All the barons said they would pray him and desire him. So\r\nMerlin was sent for, and fair desired of all the barons to give them\r\nbest counsel. I shall say you, said Merlin, I warn you all, your\r\nenemies are passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms as be\r\nalive, and by this time they have gotten to them four kings more, and a\r\nmighty duke; and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than\r\nhe may make within the bounds of his own realm, an he fight with them\r\nin battle, he shall be overcome and slain. What were best to do in this\r\ncause? said all the barons. I shall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice;\r\nthere are two brethren beyond the sea, and they be kings both, and\r\nmarvellous good men of their hands; and that one hight King Ban of\r\nBenwick, and that other hight King Bors of Gaul, that is France. And on\r\nthese two kings warreth a mighty man of men, the King Claudas, and\r\nstriveth with them for a castle, and great war is betwixt them. But\r\nthis Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he getteth good knights,\r\nthat he putteth these two kings most part to the worse; wherefore this\r\nis my counsel, that our king and sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban\r\nand Bors by two trusty knights with letters well devised, that an they\r\nwill come and see King Arthur and his court, and so help him in his\r\nwars, that he will be sworn unto them to help them in their wars\r\nagainst King Claudas. Now, what say ye unto this counsel? said Merlin.\r\nThis is well counselled, said the king and all the barons.\r\n\r\nRight so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the\r\nmessage unto the two kings. So were there made letters in the pleasant\r\nwise according unto King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s desire. Ulfius and Brastias were made\r\nthe messengers, and so rode forth well horsed and well armed and as the\r\nguise was that time, and so passed the sea and rode toward the city of\r\nBenwick. And there besides were eight knights that espied them, and at\r\na strait passage they met with Ulfius and Brastias, and would have\r\ntaken them prisoners; so they prayed them that they might pass, for\r\nthey were messengers unto King Ban and Bors sent from King Arthur.\r\nTherefore, said the eight knights, ye shall die or be prisoners, for we\r\nbe knights of King Claudas. And therewith two of them dressed their\r\nspears, and Ulfius and Brastias dressed their spears, and ran together\r\nwith great raundon. And Claudas\xe2\x80\x99 knights brake their spears, and theirs\r\nto-held and bare the two knights out of their saddles to the earth, and\r\nso left them lying, and rode their ways. And the other six knights rode\r\nafore to a passage to meet with them again, and so Ulfius and Brastias\r\nsmote other two down, and so passed on their ways. And at the fourth\r\npassage there met two for two, and both were laid unto the earth; so\r\nthere was none of the eight knights but he was sore hurt or bruised.\r\nAnd when they come to Benwick it fortuned there were both kings, Ban\r\nand Bors.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was told the kings that there were come messengers, there\r\nwere sent unto them two knights of worship, the one hight Lionses, lord\r\nof the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance a worshipful knight. Anon\r\nthey asked from whence they came, and they said from King Arthur, king\r\nof England; so they took them in their arms and made great joy each of\r\nother. But anon, as the two kings wist they were messengers of\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s, there was made no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the\r\nknights, and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were\r\nmost welcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they\r\nkissed the letters and delivered them. And when Ban and Bors understood\r\nthe letters, then they were more welcome than they were before. And\r\nafter the haste of the letters they gave them this answer, that they\r\nwould fulfil the desire of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s writing, and Ulfius and\r\nBrastias, tarry there as long as they would, they should have such\r\ncheer as might be made them in those marches. Then Ulfius and Brastias\r\ntold the kings of the adventure at their passages of the eight knights.\r\nHa! ah! said Ban and Bors, they were my good friends. I would I had\r\nwist of them; they should not have escaped so. So Ulfius and Brastias\r\nhad good cheer and great gifts, as much as they might bear away; and\r\nhad their answer by mouth and by writing, that those two kings would\r\ncome unto Arthur in all the haste that they might. So the two knights\r\nrode on afore, and passed the sea, and came to their lord, and told him\r\nhow they had sped, whereof King Arthur was passing glad. At what time\r\nsuppose ye the two kings will be here? Sir, said they, afore All\r\nHallowmass. Then the king let purvey for a great feast, and let cry a\r\ngreat jousts. And by All Hallowmass the two kings were come over the\r\nsea with three hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for\r\nthe war. And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and\r\nthere was great joy as could be thought or made. And on All Hallowmass\r\nat the great feast, sat in the hall the three kings, and Sir Kay\r\nseneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, that was Duke\r\nCorneus\xe2\x80\x99 son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of Cardol, these three\r\nknights had the rule of all the service that served the kings. And\r\nanon, as they had washen and risen, all knights that would joust made\r\nthem ready; by then they were ready on horseback there were seven\r\nhundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and Bors, with the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay\xe2\x80\x99s father, they were in a place covered\r\nwith cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and gentlewomen, for to\r\nbehold who did best, and thereon to give judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two kings\r\nBan and Bors, and how they went over the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights\r\nin two parties. And there were three hundred knights of the realm of\r\nBenwick and of Gaul turned on the other side. Then they dressed their\r\nshields, and began to couch their spears many good knights. So Griflet\r\nwas the first that met with a knight, one Ladinas, and they met so\r\neagerly that all men had wonder; and they so fought that their shields\r\nfell to pieces, and horse and man fell to the earth; and both the\r\nFrench knight and the English knight lay so long that all men weened\r\nthey had been dead. When Lucas the butler saw Griflet so lie, he horsed\r\nhim again anon, and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many\r\nbachelors. Also Sir Kay came out of an ambushment with five knights\r\nwith him, and they six smote other six down. But Sir Kay did that day\r\nmarvellous deeds of arms, that there was none did so well as he that\r\nday. Then there came Ladinas and Gracian, two knights of France, and\r\ndid passing well, that all men praised them.\r\n\r\nThen came there Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met with Sir Kay, and\r\nsmote him down horse and man, where fore Sir Griflet was wroth, and met\r\nwith Sir Placidas so hard, that horse and man fell to the earth. But\r\nwhen the five knights wist that Sir Kay had a fall, they were wroth out\r\nof wit, and therewith each of them five bare down a knight. When King\r\nArthur and the two kings saw them begin to wax wroth on both parties,\r\nthey leapt on small hackneys, and let cry that all men should depart\r\nunto their lodging. And so they went home and unarmed them, and so to\r\nevensong and supper. And after, the three kings went into a garden, and\r\ngave the prize unto Sir Kay, and to Lucas the butler, and unto Sir\r\nGriflet. And then they went unto council, and with them Gwenbaus, the\r\nbrother unto Sir Ban and Bors, a wise clerk, and thither went Ulfius\r\nand Brastias, and Merlin. And after they had been in council, they went\r\nunto bed. And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to\r\ntheir council, and made many arguments what were best to do. At the\r\nlast they were concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King\r\nBan, and that was a ring, unto his men and King Bors\xe2\x80\x99; and Gracian and\r\nPlacidas should go again and keep their castles and their countries, as\r\nfor [dread of King Claudas] King Ban of Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul\r\nhad ordained them, and so passed the sea and came to Benwick. And when\r\nthe people saw King Ban\xe2\x80\x99s ring, and Gracian and Placidas, they were\r\nglad, and asked how the kings fared, and made great joy of their\r\nwelfare and cording, and according unto the sovereign lords desire, the\r\nmen of war made them ready in all haste possible, so that they were\r\nfifteen thousand on horse and foot, and they had great plenty of\r\nvictual with them, by Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s provision. But Gracian and Placidas were\r\nleft to furnish and garnish the castles, for dread of King Claudas.\r\nRight so Merlin passed the sea, well victualled both by water and by\r\nland. And when he came to the sea he sent home the footmen again, and\r\ntook no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback, the most part\r\nmen of arms, and so shipped and passed the sea into England, and landed\r\nat Dover; and through the wit of Merlin, he had the host northward, the\r\npriviest way that could be thought, unto the forest of Bedegraine, and\r\nthere in a valley he lodged them secretly.\r\n\r\nThen rode Merlin unto Arthur and the two kings, and told them how he\r\nhad sped; whereof they had great marvel, that man on earth might speed\r\nso soon, and go and come. So Merlin told them ten thousand were in the\r\nforest of Bedegraine, well armed at all points. Then was there no more\r\nto say, but to horseback went all the host as Arthur had afore\r\npurveyed. So with twenty thousand he passed by night and day, but there\r\nwas made such an ordinance afore by Merlin, that there should no man of\r\nwar ride nor go in no country on this side Trent water, but if he had a\r\ntoken from King Arthur, where through the king\xe2\x80\x99s enemies durst not ride\r\nas they did to-fore to espy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How eleven kings gathered a great host against King\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\nAnd so within a little space the three kings came unto the castle of\r\nBedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and well beseen,\r\nwhereof they had great joy, and victual they wanted none. This was the\r\ncause of the northern host: that they were reared for the despite and\r\nrebuke the six kings had at Carlion. And those six kings by their\r\nmeans, gat unto them five other kings; and thus they began to gather\r\ntheir people.\r\n\r\nAnd now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave other,\r\ntill they had destroyed Arthur. And then they made an oath. The first\r\nthat began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet, that he would bring with\r\nhim five thousand men of arms, the which were ready on horseback. Then\r\nsware King Brandegoris of Stranggore that he would bring five thousand\r\nmen of arms on horseback. Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland\r\nhe would bring three thousand men of arms. Then sware the King of the\r\nHundred Knights, that was a passing good man and a young, that he would\r\nbring four thousand men of arms on horseback. Then there swore King\r\nLot, a passing good knight, and Sir Gawain\xe2\x80\x99s father, that he would\r\nbring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King\r\nUrience, that was Sir Uwain\xe2\x80\x99s father, of the land of Gore, and he would\r\nbring six thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King\r\nIdres of Cornwall, that he would bring five thousand men of arms on\r\nhorseback. Also there swore King Cradelmas to bring five thousand men\r\non horseback. Also there swore King Agwisance of Ireland to bring five\r\nthousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Nentres to\r\nbring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King\r\nCarados to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. So their whole\r\nhost was of clean men of arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot\r\nten thousand of good men\xe2\x80\x99s bodies. Then were they soon ready, and\r\nmounted upon horse and sent forth their fore-riders, for these eleven\r\nkings in their ways laid a siege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so\r\nthey departed and drew toward Arthur, and left few to abide at the\r\nsiege, for the castle of Bedegraine was holden of King Arthur, and the\r\nmen that were therein were Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. Of a dream of the King with the Hundred Knights.\r\n\r\nSo by Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s advice there were sent fore-riders to skim the country,\r\nand they met with the fore-riders of the north, and made them to tell\r\nwhich way the host came, and then they told it to Arthur, and by King\r\nBan and Bors\xe2\x80\x99 council they let burn and destroy all the country afore\r\nthem, there they should ride.\r\n\r\nThe King with the Hundred Knights met a wonder dream two nights afore\r\nthe battle, that there blew a great wind, and blew down their castles\r\nand their towns, and after that came a water and bare it all away. All\r\nthat heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle. Then by\r\ncounsel of Merlin, when they wist which way the eleven kings would ride\r\nand lodge that night, at midnight they set upon them, as they were in\r\ntheir pavilions. But the scout-watch by their host cried, Lords! at\r\narms! for here be your enemies at your hand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How the eleven kings with their host fought against Arthur\r\nand his host, and many great feats of the war.\r\n\r\nThen King Arthur and King Ban and King Bors, with their good and trusty\r\nknights, set on them so fiercely that they made them overthrow their\r\npavilions on their heads, but the eleven kings, by manly prowess of\r\narms, took a fair champaign, but there was slain that morrowtide ten\r\nthousand good men\xe2\x80\x99s bodies. And so they had afore them a strong\r\npassage, yet were they fifty thousand of hardy men. Then it drew toward\r\nday. Now shall ye do by mine advice, said Merlin unto the three kings:\r\nI would that King Ban and King Bors, with their fellowship of ten\r\nthousand men, were put in a wood here beside, in an ambushment, and\r\nkeep them privy, and that they be laid or the light of the day come,\r\nand that they stir not till ye and your knights have fought with them\r\nlong. And when it is daylight, dress your battle even afore them and\r\nthe passage, that they may see all your host, for then will they be the\r\nmore hardy, when they see you but about twenty thousand men, and cause\r\nthem to be the gladder to suffer you and your host to come over the\r\npassage. All the three kings and the whole barons said that Merlin said\r\npassingly well, and it was done anon as Merlin had devised. So on the\r\nmorn, when either host saw other, the host of the north was well\r\ncomforted. Then to Ulfius and Brastias were delivered three thousand\r\nmen of arms, and they set on them fiercely in the passage, and slew on\r\nthe right hand and on the left hand that it was wonder to tell.\r\n\r\nWhen that the eleven kings saw that there was so few a fellowship did\r\nsuch deeds of arms, they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely;\r\nand there was Sir Ulfius\xe2\x80\x99s horse slain under him, but he did\r\nmarvellously well on foot. But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King\r\nClariance of Northumberland, were alway grievous on Ulfius. Then\r\nBrastias saw his fellow fared so withal he smote the duke with a spear,\r\nthat horse and man fell down. That saw King Clariance and returned unto\r\nBrastias, and either smote other so that horse and man went to the\r\nearth, and so they lay long astonied, and their horses\xe2\x80\x99 knees brast to\r\nthe hard bone. Then came Sir Kay the seneschal with six fellows with\r\nhim, and did passing well. With that came the eleven kings, and there\r\nwas Griflet put to the earth, horse and man, and Lucas the butler,\r\nhorse and man, by King Brandegoris, and King Idres, and King Agwisance.\r\nThen waxed the medley passing hard on both parties. When Sir Kay saw\r\nGriflet on foot, he rode on King Nentres and smote him down, and led\r\nhis horse unto Sir Griflet, and horsed him again. Also Sir Kay with the\r\nsame spear smote down King Lot, and hurt him passing sore. That saw the\r\nKing with the Hundred Knights, and ran unto Sir Kay and smote him down,\r\nand took his horse, and gave him King Lot, whereof he said gramercy.\r\nWhen Sir Griflet saw Sir Kay and Lucas the butler on foot, he took a\r\nsharp spear, great and square, and rode to Pinel, a good man of arms,\r\nand smote horse and man down, and then he took his horse, and gave him\r\nunto Sir Kay. Then King Lot saw King Nentres on foot, he ran unto Melot\r\nde la Roche, and smote him down, horse and man, and gave King Nentres\r\nthe horse, and horsed him again. Also the King of the Hundred Knights\r\nsaw King Idres on foot; then he ran unto Gwiniart de Bloi, and smote\r\nhim down, horse and man, and gave King Idres the horse, and horsed him\r\nagain; and King Lot smote down Clariance de la Forest Savage, and gave\r\nthe horse unto Duke Eustace. And so when they had horsed the kings\r\nagain they drew them, all eleven kings, together, and said they would\r\nbe revenged of the damage that they had taken that day. The meanwhile\r\ncame in Sir Ector with an eager countenance, and found Ulfius and\r\nBrastias on foot, in great peril of death, that were foul defoiled\r\nunder horse-feet.\r\n\r\nThen Arthur as a lion, ran unto King Cradelment of North Wales, and\r\nsmote him through the left side, that the horse and the king fell down;\r\nand then he took the horse by the rein, and led him unto Ulfius, and\r\nsaid, Have this horse, mine old friend, for great need hast thou of\r\nhorse. Gramercy, said Ulfius. Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in\r\narms, that all men had wonder. When the King with the Hundred Knights\r\nsaw King Cradelment on foot, he ran unto Sir Ector, that was well\r\nhorsed, Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s father, and smote horse and man down, and gave the\r\nhorse unto the king, and horsed him again. And when King Arthur saw the\r\nking ride on Sir Ector\xe2\x80\x99s horse, he was wroth and with his sword he\r\nsmote the king on the helm, that a quarter of the helm and shield fell\r\ndown, and so the sword carved down unto the horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and so the\r\nking and the horse fell down to the ground. Then Sir Kay came unto Sir\r\nMorganore, seneschal with the King of the Hundred Knights, and smote\r\nhim down, horse and man, and led the horse unto his father, Sir Ector;\r\nthen Sir Ector ran unto a knight, hight Lardans, and smote horse and\r\nman down, and led the horse unto Sir Brastias, that great need had of\r\nan horse, and was greatly defoiled. When Brastias beheld Lucas the\r\nbutler, that lay like a dead man under the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, and ever Sir\r\nGriflet did marvellously for to rescue him, and there were always\r\nfourteen knights on Sir Lucas; then Brastias smote one of them on the\r\nhelm, that it went to the teeth, and he rode to another and smote him,\r\nthat the arm flew into the field. Then he went to the third and smote\r\nhim on the shoulder, that shoulder and arm flew in the field. And when\r\nGriflet saw rescues, he smote a knight on the temples, that head and\r\nhelm went to the earth, and Griflet took the horse of that knight, and\r\nled him unto Sir Lucas, and bade him mount upon the horse and revenge\r\nhis hurts. For Brastias had slain a knight to-fore and horsed Griflet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. Yet of the same battle.\r\n\r\nThen Lucas saw King Agwisance, that late had slain Moris de la Roche,\r\nand Lucas ran to him with a short spear that was great, that he gave\r\nhim such a fall, that the horse fell down to the earth. Also Lucas\r\nfound there on foot, Bloias de La Flandres, and Sir Gwinas, two hardy\r\nknights, and in that woodness that Lucas was in, he slew two bachelors\r\nand horsed them again. Then waxed the battle passing hard on both\r\nparties, but Arthur was glad that his knights were horsed again, and\r\nthen they fought together, that the noise and sound rang by the water\r\nand the wood. Wherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready, and\r\ndressed their shields and harness, and they were so courageous that\r\nmany knights shook and bevered for eagerness. All this while Lucas, and\r\nGwinas, and Briant, and Bellias of Flanders, held strong medley against\r\nsix kings, that was King Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King\r\nIdres, King Uriens, and King Agwisance. So with the help of Sir Kay and\r\nof Sir Griflet they held these six kings hard, that unnethe they had\r\nany power to defend them. But when Sir Arthur saw the battle would not\r\nbe ended by no manner, he fared wood as a lion, and steered his horse\r\nhere and there, on the right hand, and on the left hand, that he\r\nstinted not till he had slain twenty knights. Also he wounded King Lot\r\nsore on the shoulder, and made him to leave that ground, for Sir Kay\r\nand Griflet did with King Arthur there great deeds of arms. Then\r\nUlfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector encountered against the Duke\r\nEustace, and King Cradelment, and King Clariance of Northumberland, and\r\nKing Carados, and against the King with the Hundred Knights. So these\r\nknights encountered with these kings, that they made them to avoid the\r\nground. Then King Lot made great dole for his damages and his fellows,\r\nand said unto the ten kings, But if ye will do as I devise we shall be\r\nslain and destroyed; let me have the King with the Hundred Knights, and\r\nKing Agwisance, and King Idres, and the Duke of Cambenet, and we five\r\nkings will have fifteen thousand men of arms with us, and we will go\r\napart while ye six kings hold medley with twelve thousand; an we see\r\nthat ye have foughten with them long, then will we come on fiercely,\r\nand else shall we never match them, said King Lot, but by this mean. So\r\nthey departed as they here devised, and six kings made their party\r\nstrong against Arthur, and made great war long.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile brake the ambushment of King Ban and King Bors, and\r\nLionses and Phariance had the vanguard, and they two knights met with\r\nKing Idres and his fellowship, and there began a great medley of\r\nbreaking of spears, and smiting of swords, with slaying of men and\r\nhorses, and King Idres was near at discomforture.\r\n\r\nThat saw Agwisance the king, and put Lionses and Phariance in point of\r\ndeath; for the Duke of Cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship.\r\nSo these two knights were in great danger of their lives that they were\r\nfain to return, but always they rescued themselves and their fellowship\r\nmarvellously. When King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved\r\nhim sore; then he came on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black\r\nas Inde. When King Lot had espied King Bors, he knew him well, then he\r\nsaid, O Jesu, defend us from death and horrible maims! for I see well\r\nwe be in great peril of death; for I see yonder a king, one of the most\r\nworshipfullest men and one of the best knights of the world, is\r\ninclined unto his fellowship. What is he? said the King with the\r\nHundred Knights. It is, said King Lot, King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how\r\nthey came into this country without witting of us all. It was by\r\nMerlin\xe2\x80\x99s advice, said the knight. As for him, said King Carados, I will\r\nencounter with King Bors, an ye will rescue me when myster is. Go on,\r\nsaid they all, we will do all that we may. Then King Carados and his\r\nhost rode on a soft pace, till that they came as nigh King Bors as\r\nbow-draught; then either battle let their horse run as fast as they\r\nmight. And Bleoberis, that was godson unto King Bors, he bare his chief\r\nstandard, that was a passing good knight. Now shall we see, said King\r\nBors, how these northern Britons can bear the arms: and King Bors\r\nencountered with a knight, and smote him throughout with a spear that\r\nhe fell dead unto the earth; and after drew his sword and did\r\nmarvellous deeds of arms, that all parties had great wonder thereof;\r\nand his knights failed not, but did their part, and King Carados was\r\nsmitten to the earth. With that came the King with the Hundred Knights\r\nand rescued King Carados mightily by force of arms, for he was a\r\npassing good knight of a king, and but a young man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. Yet more of the same battle.\r\n\r\nBy then came into the field King Ban as fierce as a lion, with bands of\r\ngreen and thereupon gold. Ha! a! said King Lot, we must be discomfited,\r\nfor yonder I see the most valiant knight of the world, and the man of\r\nthe most renown, for such two brethren as is King Ban and King Bors are\r\nnot living, wherefore we must needs void or die; and but if we avoid\r\nmanly and wisely there is but death. When King Ban came into the\r\nbattle, he came in so fiercely that the strokes redounded again from\r\nthe wood and the water; wherefore King Lot wept for pity and dole that\r\nhe saw so many good knights take their end. But through the great force\r\nof King Ban they made both the northern battles that were departed\r\nhurtled together for great dread; and the three kings and their knights\r\nslew on ever, that it was pity on to behold that multitude of the\r\npeople that fled. But King Lot, and King of the Hundred Knights, and\r\nKing Morganore gathered the people together passing knightly, and did\r\ngreat prowess of arms, and held the battle all that day, like hard.\r\n\r\nWhen the King of the Hundred Knights beheld the great damage that King\r\nBan did, he thrust unto him with his horse, and smote him on high upon\r\nthe helm, a great stroke, and astonied him sore. Then King Ban was\r\nwroth with him, and followed on him fiercely; the other saw that, and\r\ncast up his shield, and spurred his horse forward, but the stroke of\r\nKing Ban fell down and carved a cantel off the shield, and the sword\r\nslid down by the hauberk behind his back, and cut through the trapping\r\nof steel and the horse even in two pieces, that the sword felt the\r\nearth. Then the King of the Hundred Knights voided the horse lightly,\r\nand with his sword he broached the horse of King Ban through and\r\nthrough. With that King Ban voided lightly from the dead horse, and\r\nthen King Ban smote at the other so eagerly, and smote him on the helm\r\nthat he fell to the earth. Also in that ire he felled King Morganore,\r\nand there was great slaughter of good knights and much people. By then\r\ncame into the press King Arthur, and found King Ban standing among dead\r\nmen and dead horses, fighting on foot as a wood lion, that there came\r\nnone nigh him, as far as he might reach with his sword, but he caught a\r\ngrievous buffet; whereof King Arthur had great pity. And Arthur was so\r\nbloody, that by his shield there might no man know him, for all was\r\nblood and brains on his sword. And as Arthur looked by him he saw a\r\nknight that was passingly well horsed, and therewith Sir Arthur ran to\r\nhim, and smote him on the helm, that his sword went unto his teeth, and\r\nthe knight sank down to the earth dead, and anon Arthur took the horse\r\nby the rein, and led him unto King Ban, and said, Fair brother, have\r\nthis horse, for he have great myster thereof, and me repenteth sore of\r\nyour great damage. It shall be soon revenged, said King Ban, for I\r\ntrust in God mine ure is not such but some of them may sore repent\r\nthis. I will well, said Arthur, for I see your deeds full actual;\r\nnevertheless, I might not come at you at that time.\r\n\r\nBut when King Ban was mounted on horseback, then there began new\r\nbattle, the which was sore and hard, and passing great slaughter. And\r\nso through great force King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors made their\r\nknights a little to withdraw them. But alway the eleven kings with\r\ntheir chivalry never turned back; and so withdrew them to a little\r\nwood, and so over a little river, and there they rested them, for on\r\nthe night they might have no rest on the field. And then the eleven\r\nkings and knights put them on a heap all together, as men adread and\r\nout of all comfort. But there was no man might pass them, they held\r\nthem so hard together both behind and before, that King Arthur had\r\nmarvel of their deeds of arms, and was passing wroth. Ah, Sir Arthur,\r\nsaid King Ban and King Bors, blame them not, for they do as good men\r\nought to do. For by my faith, said King Ban, they are the best fighting\r\nmen, and knights of most prowess, that ever I saw or heard speak of,\r\nand those eleven kings are men of great worship; and if they were\r\nlonging unto you there were no king under the heaven had such eleven\r\nknights, and of such worship. I may not love them, said Arthur, they\r\nwould destroy me. That wot we well, said King Ban and King Bors, for\r\nthey are your mortal enemies, and that hath been proved aforehand; and\r\nthis day they have done their part, and that is great pity of their\r\nwilfulness.\r\n\r\nThen all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot,\r\nLords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind;\r\nye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because\r\nwe wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the\r\nfoot-men we lose ten horsemen for him; therefore this is mine advice,\r\nlet us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble\r\nArthur will not tarry on the footmen, for they may save themselves, the\r\nwood is near hand. And when we horsemen be together, look every each of\r\nyou kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death.\r\nAnd who that seeth any man dress him to flee, lightly that he be slain,\r\nfor it is better that we slay a coward, than through a coward all we to\r\nbe slain. How say ye? said King Lot, answer me all ye kings. It is well\r\nsaid, quoth King Nentres; so said the King of the Hundred Knights; the\r\nsame said the King Carados, and King Uriens; so did King Idres and King\r\nBrandegoris; and so did King Cradelment, and the Duke of Cambenet; the\r\nsame said King Clariance and King Agwisance, and sware they would never\r\nfail other, neither for life nor for death. And whoso that fled, but\r\ndid as they did, should be slain. Then they amended their harness, and\r\nrighted their shields, and took new spears and set them on their\r\nthighs, and stood still as it had been a plump of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. Yet more of the same battle, and how it was ended by\r\nMerlin.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their\r\nknights, they praised them much for their noble cheer of chivalry, for\r\nthe hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw. With that, there\r\ndressed them a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they\r\nwould break their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance,\r\nUlfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay, Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de\r\nDieu, Mariet de la Roche, Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage,\r\nBellaus, Morians of the Castle [of] Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle\r\nof Ladies, Annecians that was King Bors\xe2\x80\x99 godson, a noble knight,\r\nLadinas de la Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois\r\nde la Case, and Sir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on\r\nafore with spears on their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as\r\nthe horses might run. And the eleven kings with part of their knights\r\nrushed with their horses as fast as they might with their spears, and\r\nthere they did on both parties marvellous deeds of arms. So came into\r\nthe thick of the press, Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on\r\nboth hands, that their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks. But\r\never the eleven kings and their host was ever in the visage of Arthur.\r\nWherefore Ban and Bors had great marvel, considering the great\r\nslaughter that there was, but at the last they were driven aback over a\r\nlittle river. With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and said\r\nunto Arthur, Thou hast never done! Hast thou not done enough? of three\r\nscore thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand, and\r\nit is time to say Ho! For God is wroth with thee, that thou wilt never\r\nhave done; for yonder eleven kings at this time will not be overthrown,\r\nbut an thou tarry on them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they\r\nshall increase. And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest\r\nyou as soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with\r\nsilver, for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be too dear\r\nfor them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never men did more\r\nof prowess than they have done today, for ye have matched this day with\r\nthe best fighters of the world. That is truth, said King Ban and Bors.\r\nAlso said Merlin, withdraw you where ye list, for this three year I\r\ndare undertake they shall not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new\r\ntidings. And then Merlin said unto Arthur, These eleven kings have more\r\non hand than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their\r\ncountries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have laid\r\nsiege at the castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction; therefore\r\ndread you not this three year. Also, sir, all the goods that be gotten\r\nat this battle, let it be searched, and when ye have it in your hands,\r\nlet it be given freely unto these two kings, Ban and Bors, that they\r\nmay reward their knights withal; and that shall cause strangers to be\r\nof better will to do you service at need. Also you be able to reward\r\nyour own knights of your own goods whensomever it liketh you. It is\r\nwell said, quoth Arthur, and as thou hast devised, so shall it be done.\r\nWhen it was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the goods as freely to\r\ntheir knights as freely as it was given to them. Then Merlin took his\r\nleave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see his master\r\nBleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he departed and came to\r\nhis master, that was passing glad of his coming; and there he told how\r\nArthur and the two kings had sped at the great battle, and how it was\r\nended, and told the names of every king and knight of worship that was\r\nthere. And so Bleise wrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him,\r\nhow it began, and by whom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who\r\nhad the worse. All the battles that were done in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s days Merlin\r\ndid his master Bleise do write; also he did do write all the battles\r\nthat every worthy knight did of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\n\r\nAfter this Merlin departed from his master and came to King Arthur,\r\nthat was in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that\r\nstand in the forest of Sherwood. And Merlin was so disguised that King\r\nArthur knew him not, for he was all befurred in black sheep-skins, and\r\na great pair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and\r\nbrought wild geese in his hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas\r\nday; but King Arthur knew him not. Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will\r\nye give me a gift? Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a\r\ngift, churl? Sir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is\r\nnot in your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place\r\nwhere the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth. Who\r\ntold thee so, churl? said Arthur. Merlin told me so, said he. Then\r\nUlfius and Brastias knew him well enough, and smiled. Sir, said these\r\ntwo knights, it is Merlin that so speaketh unto you. Then King Arthur\r\nwas greatly abashed, and had marvel of Merlin, and so had King Ban and\r\nKing Bors, and so they had great disport at him. So in the meanwhile\r\nthere came a damosel that was an earl\xe2\x80\x99s daughter: his name was Sanam,\r\nand her name was Lionors, a passing fair damosel; and so she came\r\nthither for to do homage, as other lords did after the great battle.\r\nAnd King Arthur set his love greatly upon her, and so did she upon him,\r\nand the king had ado with her, and gat on her a child: his name was\r\nBorre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table Round. Then there\r\ncame word that the King Rience of North Wales made great war on King\r\nLeodegrance of Cameliard, for the which thing Arthur was wroth, for he\r\nloved him well, and hated King Rience, for he was alway against him. So\r\nby ordinance of the three kings that were sent home unto Benwick, all\r\nthey would depart for dread of King Claudas; and Phariance, and\r\nAntemes, and Gratian, and Lionses [of] Payarne, with the leaders of\r\nthose that should keep the kings\xe2\x80\x99 lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors rescued King\r\nLeodegrance, and other incidents.\r\n\r\nAnd then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their\r\nfellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the\r\ncountry of Cameliard, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew\r\nthere much people of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men,\r\nand put him to flight. And then had these three kings great cheer of\r\nKing Leodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they\r\nwould revenge him of his enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight\r\nof Guenever, the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he loved\r\nher. After they were wedded, as it telleth in the book. So, briefly to\r\nmake an end, they took their leave to go into their own countries, for\r\nKing Claudas did great destruction on their lands. Then said Arthur, I\r\nwill go with you. Nay, said the kings, ye shall not at this time, for\r\nye have much to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and\r\nwith the great goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts,\r\nwe shall wage good knights and withstand the King Claudas\xe2\x80\x99 malice, for\r\nby the grace of God, an we have need we will send to you for your\r\nsuccour; and if ye have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by\r\nthe faith of our bodies. It shall not, said Merlin, need that these two\r\nkings come again in the way of war, but I know well King Arthur may not\r\nbe long from you, for within a year or two ye shall have great need,\r\nand then shall he revenge you on your enemies, as ye have done on his.\r\nFor these eleven kings shall die all in a day, by the great might and\r\nprowess of arms of two valiant knights (as it telleth after); their\r\nnames be Balin le Savage, and Balan, his brother, that be marvellous\r\ngood knights as be any living.\r\n\r\nNow turn we to the eleven kings that returned unto a city that hight\r\nSorhaute, the which city was within King Uriens\xe2\x80\x99, and there they\r\nrefreshed them as well as they might, and made leeches search their\r\nwounds, and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people. With that\r\nthere came a messenger and told how there was come into their lands\r\npeople that were lawless as well as Saracens, a forty thousand, and\r\nhave burnt and slain all the people that they may come by, without\r\nmercy, and have laid siege on the castle of Wandesborow. Alas, said the\r\neleven kings, here is sorrow upon sorrow, and if we had not warred\r\nagainst Arthur as we have done, he would soon revenge us. As for King\r\nLeodegrance, he loveth Arthur better than us, and as for King Rience,\r\nhe hath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he hath laid siege unto him.\r\nSo they consented together to keep all the marches of Cornwall, of\r\nWales, and of the North. So first, they put King Idres in the City of\r\nNauntes in Britain, with four thousand men of arms, to watch both the\r\nwater and the land. Also they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres\r\nof Garlot, with four thousand knights to watch both on water and on\r\nland. Also they had of other men of war more than eight thousand, for\r\nto fortify all the fortresses in the marches of Cornwall. Also they put\r\nmore knights in all the marches of Wales and Scotland, with many good\r\nmen of arms, and so they kept them together the space of three year,\r\nand ever allied them with mighty kings and dukes and lords. And to them\r\nfell King Rience of North Wales, the which and Nero that was a mighty\r\nman of men. And all this while they furnished them and garnished them\r\nof good men of arms, and victual, and of all manner of habiliment that\r\npretendeth to the war, to avenge them for the battle of Bedegraine, as\r\nit telleth in the book of adventures following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur rode to Carlion, and of his dream, and how\r\nhe saw the questing beast.\r\n\r\nThen after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King Arthur rode\r\ninto Carlion. And thither came to him, King Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife, of Orkney, in\r\nmanner of a message, but she was sent thither to espy the court of King\r\nArthur; and she came richly beseen, with her four sons, Gawaine,\r\nGaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies. For\r\nshe was a passing fair lady, therefore the king cast great love unto\r\nher, and desired to lie by her; so they were agreed, and he begat upon\r\nher Mordred, and she was his sister, on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, Igraine. So\r\nthere she rested her a month, and at the last departed. Then the king\r\ndreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread. But all this\r\ntime King Arthur knew not that King Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife was his sister. Thus was\r\nthe dream of Arthur: Him thought there was come into this land griffins\r\nand serpents, and him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the\r\nland, and then him thought he fought with them, and they did him\r\npassing great harm, and wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew\r\nthem. When the king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so\r\nto put it out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride\r\na-hunting. As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great hart\r\nafore him. This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so he spurred\r\nthe horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft he was like to\r\nhave smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so long,\r\nthat his horse lost his breath, and fell down dead. Then a yeoman\r\nfetched the king another horse.\r\n\r\nSo the king saw the hart enbushed, and his horse dead, he set him down\r\nby a fountain, and there he fell in great thoughts. And as he sat so,\r\nhim thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of thirty. And with\r\nthat the king saw coming toward him the strangest beast that ever he\r\nsaw or heard of; so the beast went to the well and drank, and the noise\r\nwas in the beast\xe2\x80\x99s belly like unto the questing of thirty couple\r\nhounds; but all the while the beast drank there was no noise in the\r\nbeast\xe2\x80\x99s belly: and there with the beast departed with a great noise,\r\nwhereof the king had great marvel. And so he was in a great thought,\r\nand therewith he fell asleep. Right so there came a knight afoot unto\r\nArthur and said, Knight full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou\r\nsawest a strange beast pass this way. Such one saw I, said King Arthur,\r\nthat is past two mile; what would ye with the beast? said Arthur. Sir,\r\nI have followed that beast long time, and killed mine horse, so would\r\nGod I had another to follow my quest. Right so came one with the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse, and when the knight saw the horse, he prayed the king to give\r\nhim the horse: for I have followed this quest this twelvemonth, and\r\neither I shall achieve him, or bleed of the best blood of my body.\r\nPellinore, that time king, followed the Questing Beast, and after his\r\ndeath Sir Palamides followed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. How King Pellinore took Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s horse and followed the\r\nQuesting Beast, and how Merlin met with Arthur.\r\n\r\nSir knight, said the king, leave that quest, and suffer me to have it,\r\nand I will follow it another twelvemonth. Ah, fool, said the knight\r\nunto Arthur, it is in vain thy desire, for it shall never be achieved\r\nbut by me, or my next kin. Therewith he started unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s horse\r\nand mounted into the saddle, and said, Gramercy, this horse is my own.\r\nWell, said the king, thou mayst take my horse by force, but an I might\r\nprove thee whether thou were better on horseback or I.\xe2\x80\x94Well, said the\r\nknight, seek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh this well thou shalt\r\nfind me, and so passed on his way. Then the king sat in a study, and\r\nbade his men fetch his horse as fast as ever they might. Right so came\r\nby him Merlin like a child of fourteen year of age, and saluted the\r\nking, and asked him why he was so pensive. I may well be pensive, said\r\nthe king, for I have seen the marvellest sight that ever I saw. That\r\nknow I well, said Merlin, as well as thyself, and of all thy thoughts,\r\nbut thou art but a fool to take thought, for it will not amend thee.\r\nAlso I know what thou art, and who was thy father, and of whom thou\r\nwert begotten; King Uther Pendragon was thy father, and begat thee on\r\nIgraine. That is false, said King Arthur, how shouldest thou know it,\r\nfor thou art not so old of years to know my father? Yes, said Merlin, I\r\nknow it better than ye or any man living. I will not believe thee, said\r\nArthur, and was wroth with the child. So departed Merlin, and came\r\nagain in the likeness of an old man of fourscore year of age, whereof\r\nthe king was right glad, for he seemed to be right wise.\r\n\r\nThen said the old man, Why are ye so sad? I may well be heavy, said\r\nArthur, for many things. Also here was a child, and told me many things\r\nthat meseemeth he should not know, for he was not of age to know my\r\nfather. Yes, said the old man, the child told you truth, and more would\r\nhe have told you an ye would have suffered him. But ye have done a\r\nthing late that God is displeased with you, for ye have lain by your\r\nsister, and on her ye have gotten a child that shall destroy you and\r\nall the knights of your realm. What are ye, said Arthur, that tell me\r\nthese tidings? I am Merlin, and I was he in the child\xe2\x80\x99s likeness. Ah,\r\nsaid King Arthur, ye are a marvellous man, but I marvel much of thy\r\nwords that I must die in battle. Marvel not, said Merlin, for it is\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s will your body to be punished for your foul deeds; but I may well\r\nbe sorry, said Merlin, for I shall die a shameful death, to be put in\r\nthe earth quick, and ye shall die a worshipful death. And as they\r\ntalked this, came one with the king\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and so the king mounted on\r\nhis horse, and Merlin on another, and so rode unto Carlion. And anon\r\nthe king asked Ector and Ulfius how he was begotten, and they told him\r\nUther Pendragon was his father and Queen Igraine his mother. Then he\r\nsaid to Merlin, I will that my mother be sent for that I may speak with\r\nher; and if she say so herself then will I believe it. In all haste,\r\nthe queen was sent for, and she came and brought with her Morgan le\r\nFay, her daughter, that was as fair a lady as any might be, and the\r\nking welcomed Igraine in the best manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. How Ulfius impeached Queen Igraine, Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s mother, of\r\ntreason; and how a knight came and desired to have the death of his\r\nmaster revenged.\r\n\r\nRight so came Ulfius, and said openly, that the king and all might hear\r\nthat were feasted that day, Ye are the falsest lady of the world, and\r\nthe most traitress unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s person. Beware, said Arthur, what\r\nthou sayest; thou speakest a great word. I am well ware, said Ulfius,\r\nwhat I speak, and here is my glove to prove it upon any man that will\r\nsay the contrary, that this Queen Igraine is causer of your great\r\ndamage, and of your great war. For, an she would have uttered it in the\r\nlife of King Uther Pendragon, of the birth of you, and how ye were\r\nbegotten ye had never had the mortal wars that ye have had; for the\r\nmost part of your barons of your realm knew never whose son ye were,\r\nnor of whom ye were begotten; and she that bare you of her body should\r\nhave made it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours, and in\r\nlike wise to all the realm, wherefore I prove her false to God and to\r\nyou and to all your realm, and who will say the contrary I will prove\r\nit on his body.\r\n\r\nThen spake Igraine and said, I am a woman and I may not fight, but\r\nrather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good man take my\r\nquarrel. More, she said, Merlin knoweth well, and ye Sir Ulfius, how\r\nKing Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagil in the likeness of my\r\nlord, that was dead three hours to-fore, and thereby gat a child that\r\nnight upon me. And after the thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and\r\nby his commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin\r\nand nourished by him, and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not\r\nwhat is his name, for I knew him never yet. And there, Ulfius said to\r\nthe queen, Merlin is more to blame than ye. Well I wot, said the queen,\r\nI bare a child by my lord King Uther, but I wot not where he is become.\r\nThen Merlin took the king by the hand, saying, This is your mother. And\r\ntherewith Sir Ector bare witness how he nourished him by Uther\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommandment. And therewith King Arthur took his mother, Queen Igraine,\r\nin his arms and kissed her, and either wept upon other. And then the\r\nking let make a feast that lasted eight days.\r\n\r\nThen on a day there came in the court a squire on horseback, leading a\r\nknight before him wounded to the death, and told him how there was a\r\nknight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by a well, and hath slain\r\nmy master, a good knight, his name was Miles; wherefore I beseech you\r\nthat my master may be buried, and that some knight may revenge my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s death. Then the noise was great of that knight\xe2\x80\x99s death in the\r\ncourt, and every man said his advice. Then came Griflet that was but a\r\nsquire, and he was but young, of the age of the king Arthur, so he\r\nbesought the king for all his service that he had done him to give the\r\norder of knighthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. How Griflet was made knight, and jousted with a knight.\r\n\r\nThou art full young and tender of age, said Arthur, for to take so high\r\nan order on thee. Sir, said Griflet, I beseech you make me knight. Sir,\r\nsaid Merlin, it were great pity to lose Griflet, for he will be a\r\npassing good man when he is of age, abiding with you the term of his\r\nlife. And if he adventure his body with yonder knight at the fountain,\r\nit is in great peril if ever he come again, for he is one of the best\r\nknights of the world, and the strongest man of arms. Well, said Arthur.\r\nSo at the desire of Griflet the king made him knight. Now, said Arthur\r\nunto Sir Griflet, sith I have made you knight thou must give me a gift.\r\nWhat ye will, said Griflet. Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy\r\nbody, when thou hast jousted with the knight at the fountain, whether\r\nit fall ye be on foot or on horseback, that right so ye shall come\r\nagain unto me without making any more debate. I will promise you, said\r\nGriflet, as you desire. Then took Griflet his horse in great haste, and\r\ndressed his shield and took a spear in his hand, and so he rode a great\r\nwallop till he came to the fountain, and thereby he saw a rich\r\npavilion, and thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse well saddled and\r\nbridled, and on a tree a shield of divers colours and a great spear.\r\nThen Griflet smote on the shield with the butt of his spear, that the\r\nshield fell down to the ground. With that the knight came out of the\r\npavilion, and said, Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield? For I\r\nwill joust with you, said Griflet. It is better ye do not, said the\r\nknight, for ye are but young, and late made knight, and your might is\r\nnothing to mine. As for that, said Griflet, I will joust with you. That\r\nis me loath, said the knight, but sith I must needs, I will dress me\r\nthereto. Of whence be ye? said the knight. Sir, I am of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\nSo the two knights ran together that Griflet\xe2\x80\x99s spear all to-shivered;\r\nand there withal he smote Griflet through the shield and the left side,\r\nand brake the spear that the truncheon stuck in his body, that horse\r\nand knight fell down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for\r\nthis land of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.\r\n\r\nWhen the knight saw him lie so on the ground, he alighted, and was\r\npassing heavy, for he weened he had slain him, and then he unlaced his\r\nhelm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he set him on his\r\nhorse, and so betook him to God, and said he had a mighty heart, and if\r\nhe might live he would prove a passing good knight. And so Sir Griflet\r\nrode to the court, where great dole was made for him. But through good\r\nleeches he was healed and saved. Right so came into the court twelve\r\nknights, and were aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and\r\nthey asked of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor\r\nwould destroy him and his land. Well, said King Arthur, ye are\r\nmessengers, therefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye should die\r\ntherefore. But this is mine answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor\r\nnone will I hold him, but on a fair field I shall give him my truage\r\nthat shall be with a sharp spear, or else with a sharp sword, and that\r\nshall not be long, by my father\xe2\x80\x99s soul, Uther Pendragon. And therewith\r\nthe messengers departed passingly wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for\r\nin evil time came they then; for the king was passingly wroth for the\r\nhurt of Sir Griflet. And so he commanded a privy man of his chamber\r\nthat or it be day his best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto\r\nhis person, be without the city or to-morrow day. Right so or to-morrow\r\nday he met with his man and his horse, and so mounted up and dressed\r\nhis shield and took his spear, and bade his chamberlain tarry there\r\ntill he came again. And so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and\r\nthen was he ware of three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain\r\nhim. Then the king rode unto them, and bade them: Flee, churls! then\r\nwere they afeard when they saw a knight, and fled. O Merlin, said\r\nArthur, here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been.\r\nNay, said Merlin, not so, for I could save myself an I would; and thou\r\nart more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the deathward, an\r\nGod be not thy friend.\r\n\r\nSo as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich\r\npavilion there by it. Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight\r\narmed in a chair. Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause abidest thou\r\nhere, that there may no knight ride this way but if he joust with thee?\r\nsaid the king. I rede thee leave that custom, said Arthur. This custom,\r\nsaid the knight, have I used and will use maugre who saith nay, and who\r\nis grieved with my custom let him amend it that will. I will amend it,\r\nsaid Arthur. I shall defend thee, said the knight. Anon he took his\r\nhorse and dressed his shield and took a spear, and they met so hard\r\neither in other\xe2\x80\x99s shields, that all to-shivered their spears. Therewith\r\nanon Arthur pulled out his sword. Nay, not so, said the knight; it is\r\nfairer, said the knight, that we twain run more together with sharp\r\nspears. I will well, said Arthur, an I had any more spears. I have\r\nenow, said the knight; so there came a squire and brought two good\r\nspears, and Arthur chose one and he another; so they spurred their\r\nhorses and came together with all their mights, that either brake their\r\nspears to their hands. Then Arthur set hand on his sword. Nay, said the\r\nknight, ye shall do better, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met\r\nwithal, and once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us\r\njoust once again. I assent me, said Arthur. Anon there were brought two\r\ngreat spears, and every knight gat a spear, and therewith they ran\r\ntogether that Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s spear all to-shivered. But the other knight hit\r\nhim so hard in midst of the shield, that horse and man fell to the\r\nearth, and therewith Arthur was eager, and pulled out his sword, and\r\nsaid, I will assay thee, sir knight, on foot, for I have lost the\r\nhonour on horseback. I will be on horseback, said the knight. Then was\r\nArthur wroth, and dressed his shield toward him with his sword drawn.\r\nWhen the knight saw that, he alighted, for him thought no worship to\r\nhave a knight at such avail, he to be on horseback and he on foot, and\r\nso he alighted and dressed his shield unto Arthur. And there began a\r\nstrong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with their swords\r\nthat the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood they bled both,\r\nthat all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood, and\r\nthus they fought long and rested them, and then they went to the battle\r\nagain, and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the\r\nearth. So at the last they smote together that both their swords met\r\neven together. But the sword of the knight smote King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sword in\r\ntwo pieces, wherefore he was heavy. Then said the knight unto Arthur,\r\nThou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and\r\nbut thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die. As for\r\ndeath, said King Arthur, welcome be it when it cometh, but to yield me\r\nunto thee as recreant I had liefer die than to be so shamed. And\r\ntherewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and took him by the middle\r\nand threw him down, and raced off his helm. When the knight felt that\r\nhe was adread, for he was a passing big man of might, and anon he\r\nbrought Arthur under him, and raced off his helm and would have smitten\r\noff his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Merlin saved Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s life, and threw an enchantment\r\non King Pellinore and made him to sleep.\r\n\r\nTherewithal came Merlin and said, Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou\r\nslay that knight thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that\r\never was realm: for this knight is a man of more worship than thou\r\nwotest of. Why, who is he? said the knight. It is King Arthur. Then\r\nwould he have slain him for dread of his wrath, and heaved up his\r\nsword, and therewith Merlin cast an enchantment to the knight, that he\r\nfell to the earth in a great sleep. Then Merlin took up King Arthur,\r\nand rode forth on the knight\xe2\x80\x99s horse. Alas! said Arthur, what hast thou\r\ndone, Merlin? hast thou slain this good knight by thy crafts? There\r\nliveth not so worshipful a knight as he was; I had liefer than the\r\nstint of my land a year that he were alive. Care ye not, said Merlin,\r\nfor he is wholer than ye; for he is but asleep, and will awake within\r\nthree hours. I told you, said Merlin, what a knight he was; here had ye\r\nbeen slain had I not been. Also there liveth not a bigger knight than\r\nhe is one, and he shall hereafter do you right good service; and his\r\nname is Pellinore, and he shall have two sons that shall be passing\r\ngood men; save one they shall have no fellow of prowess and of good\r\nliving, and their names shall be Percivale of Wales and Lamerake of\r\nWales, and he shall tell you the name of your own son, begotten of your\r\nsister, that shall be the destruction of all this realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. How Arthur by the mean of Merlin gat Excalibur his sword\r\nof the Lady of the Lake.\r\n\r\nRight so the king and he departed, and went unto an hermit that was a\r\ngood man and a great leech. So the hermit searched all his wounds and\r\ngave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were\r\nhis wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed. And\r\nas they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword. No force, said Merlin,\r\nhereby is a sword that shall be yours, an I may. So they rode till they\r\ncame to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst\r\nof the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that\r\nheld a fair sword in that hand. Lo! said Merlin, yonder is that sword\r\nthat I spake of. With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake. What\r\ndamosel is that? said Arthur. That is the Lady of the Lake, said\r\nMerlin; and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place\r\nas any on earth, and richly beseen; and this damosel will come to you\r\nanon, and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.\r\nAnon withal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him, and he her\r\nagain. Damosel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm\r\nholdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have no sword. Sir\r\nArthur, king, said the damosel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give\r\nme a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it. By my faith, said\r\nArthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask. Well! said the damosel,\r\ngo ye into yonder barge, and row yourself to the sword, and take it and\r\nthe scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time. So\r\nSir Arthur and Merlin alighted and tied their horses to two trees, and\r\nso they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the\r\nhand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him,\r\nand the arm and the hand went under the water. And so [they] came unto\r\nthe land and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What\r\nsignifieth yonder pavilion? It is the knight\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion, said Merlin,\r\nthat ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore; but he is out, he is not\r\nthere. He hath ado with a knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they\r\nhave foughten together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he had\r\nbeen dead, and he hath chased him even to Carlion, and we shall meet\r\nwith him anon in the highway. That is well said, said Arthur, now have\r\nI a sword, now will I wage battle with him, and be avenged on him. Sir,\r\nyou shall not so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and\r\nchasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also he\r\nwill not be lightly matched of one knight living, and therefore it is\r\nmy counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short\r\ntime, and his sons after his days. Also ye shall see that day in short\r\nspace, you shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I\r\nsee him, I will do as ye advise, said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well. Whether\r\nliketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard? Me liketh\r\nbetter the sword, said Arthur. Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the\r\nscabbard is worth ten of the swords, for whiles ye have the scabbard\r\nupon you, ye shall never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded;\r\ntherefore keep well the scabbard always with you. So they rode unto\r\nCarlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had\r\ndone such a craft, that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by\r\nwithout any words. I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not\r\nspeak. Sir, said Merlin, he saw you not, for an he had seen you, ye had\r\nnot lightly departed. So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights\r\nwere passing glad. And when they heard of his adventures, they\r\nmarvelled that he would jeopard his person so, alone. But all men of\r\nworship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain, that would put\r\nhis person in adventure as other poor knights did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. How tidings came to Arthur that King Rience had overcome\r\neleven kings, and how he desired Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s beard to trim his mantle.\r\n\r\nThis meanwhile came a messenger from King Rience of North Wales, and\r\nking he was of all Ireland, and of many isles. And this was his\r\nmessage, greeting well King Arthur in this manner wise, saying that\r\nKing Rience had discomfited and overcome eleven kings, and everych of\r\nthem did him homage, and that was this, they gave him their beards\r\nclean flayed off, as much as there was; wherefore the messenger came\r\nfor King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s beard. For King Rience had purfled a mantle with\r\nkings\xe2\x80\x99 beards, and there lacked one place of the mantle; wherefore he\r\nsent for his beard, or else he would enter into his lands, and burn and\r\nslay, and never leave till he have the head and the beard. Well, said\r\nArthur, thou hast said thy message, the which is the most villainous\r\nand lewdest message that ever man heard sent unto a king; also thou\r\nmayest see my beard is full young yet to make a purfle of it. But tell\r\nthou thy king this: I owe him none homage, nor none of mine elders; but\r\nor it be long to, he shall do me homage on both his knees, or else he\r\nshall lose his head, by the faith of my body, for this is the most\r\nshamefulest message that ever I heard speak of. I have espied thy king\r\nmet never yet with worshipful man, but tell him, I will have his head\r\nwithout he do me homage. Then the messenger departed.\r\n\r\nNow is there any here, said Arthur, that knoweth King Rience? Then\r\nanswered a knight that hight Naram, Sir, I know the king well; he is a\r\npassing good man of his body, as few be living, and a passing proud\r\nman, and Sir, doubt ye not he will make war on you with a mighty\r\npuissance. Well, said Arthur, I shall ordain for him in short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. How all the children were sent for that were born on\r\nMay-day, and how Mordred was saved.\r\n\r\nThen King Arthur let send for all the children born on May-day,\r\nbegotten of lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that\r\nhe that should destroy him should be born on May-day, wherefore he sent\r\nfor them all, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsons, and all were sent unto the king, and so was Mordred sent by King\r\nLot\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four\r\nweeks old, and some less. And so by fortune the ship drave unto a\r\ncastle, and was all to-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that\r\nMordred was cast up, and a good man found him, and nourished him till\r\nhe was fourteen year old, and then he brought him to the court, as it\r\nrehearseth afterward, toward the end of the Death of Arthur. So many\r\nlords and barons of this realm were displeased, for their children were\r\nso lost, and many put the wite on Merlin more than on Arthur; so what\r\nfor dread and for love, they held their peace. But when the messenger\r\ncame to King Rience, then was he wood out of measure, and purveyed him\r\nfor a great host, as it rehearseth after in the book of Balin le\r\nSavage, that followeth next after, how by adventure Balin gat the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nExplicit liber primus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man\r\nof such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the which\r\nhad great war in his days for to get all England into his hand. For\r\nthere were many kings within the realm of England, and in Wales,\r\nScotland, and Cornwall. So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at\r\nLondon, there came a knight and told the king tidings how that the King\r\nRience of North Wales had reared a great number of people, and were\r\nentered into the land, and burnt and slew the king\xe2\x80\x99s true liege people.\r\nIf this be true, said Arthur, it were great shame unto mine estate but\r\nthat he were mightily withstood. It is truth, said the knight, for I\r\nsaw the host myself. Well, said the king, let make a cry, that all the\r\nlords, knights, and gentlemen of arms, should draw unto a castle called\r\nCamelot in those days, and there the king would let make a\r\ncouncil-general and a great jousts.\r\n\r\nSo when the king was come thither with all his baronage, and lodged as\r\nthey seemed best, there was come a damosel the which was sent on\r\nmessage from the great lady Lile of Avelion. And when she came before\r\nKing Arthur, she told from whom she came, and how she was sent on\r\nmessage unto him for these causes. Then she let her mantle fall that\r\nwas richly furred; and then was she girt with a noble sword whereof the\r\nking had marvel, and said, Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with\r\nthat sword? it beseemeth you not. Now shall I tell you, said the\r\ndamosel; this sword that I am girt withal doth me great sorrow and\r\ncumbrance, for I may not be delivered of this sword but by a knight,\r\nbut he must be a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds, and\r\nwithout villainy or treachery, and without treason. And if I may find\r\nsuch a knight that hath all these virtues, he may draw out this sword\r\nout of the sheath, for I have been at King Rience\xe2\x80\x99s it was told me\r\nthere were passing good knights, and he and all his knights have\r\nassayed it and none can speed. This is a great marvel, said Arthur, if\r\nthis be sooth; I will myself assay to draw out the sword, not presuming\r\nupon myself that I am the best knight, but that I will begin to draw at\r\nyour sword in giving example to all the barons that they shall assay\r\neverych one after other when I have assayed it. Then Arthur took the\r\nsword by the sheath and by the girdle and pulled at it eagerly, but the\r\nsword would not out.\r\n\r\nSir, said the damosel, you need not to pull half so hard, for he that\r\nshall pull it out shall do it with little might. Ye say well, said\r\nArthur; now assay ye all my barons; but beware ye be not defiled with\r\nshame, treachery, nor guile. Then it will not avail, said the damosel,\r\nfor he must be a clean knight without villainy, and of a gentle strain\r\nof father side and mother side. Most of all the barons of the Round\r\nTable that were there at that time assayed all by row, but there might\r\nnone speed; wherefore the damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and\r\nsaid, Alas! I weened in this court had been the best knights without\r\ntreachery or treason. By my faith, said Arthur, here are good knights,\r\nas I deem, as any be in the world, but their grace is not to help you,\r\nwherefore I am displeased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How Balin, arrayed like a poor knight, pulled out the\r\nsword, which afterward was the cause of his death.\r\n\r\nThen fell it so that time there was a poor knight with King Arthur,\r\nthat had been prisoner with him half a year and more for slaying of a\r\nknight, the which was cousin unto King Arthur. The name of this knight\r\nwas called Balin, and by good means of the barons he was delivered out\r\nof prison, for he was a good man named of his body, and he was born in\r\nNorthumberland. And so he went privily into the court, and saw this\r\nadventure, whereof it raised his heart, and he would assay it as other\r\nknights did, but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far\r\nin press. But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his\r\ngrace happed him, as any knight that there was. And as the damosel took\r\nher leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight\r\nBalin called unto her, and said, Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy,\r\nsuffer me as well to assay as these lords; though that I be so poorly\r\nclothed, in my heart meseemeth I am fully assured as some of these\r\nothers, and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well. The damosel\r\nbeheld the poor knight, and saw he was a likely man, but for his poor\r\narrayment she thought he should be of no worship without villainy or\r\ntreachery. And then she said unto the knight, Sir, it needeth not to\r\nput me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as\r\nother have failed. Ah! fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good\r\ntatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and\r\nworship is hid within man\xe2\x80\x99s person, and many a worshipful knight is not\r\nknown unto all people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in\r\narrayment. By God, said the damosel, ye say sooth; therefore ye shall\r\nassay to do what ye may. Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and\r\nsheath, and drew it out easily; and when he looked on the sword it\r\npleased him much. Then had the king and all the barons great marvel\r\nthat Balin had done that adventure, and many knights had great despite\r\nof Balin. Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and\r\nthe best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason,\r\ntreachery, or villainy, and many marvels shall he do. Now, gentle and\r\ncourteous knight, give me the sword again. Nay, said Balin, for this\r\nsword will I keep, but it be taken from me with force. Well, said the\r\ndamosel, ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay\r\nwith the sword the best friend that ye have, and the man that ye most\r\nlove in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction. I shall\r\ntake the adventure, said Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword\r\nye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my body. Ye shall\r\nrepent it within short time, said the damosel, for I would have the\r\nsword more for your avail than for mine, for I am passing heavy for\r\nyour sake; for ye will not believe that sword shall be your\r\ndestruction, and that is great pity. With that the damosel departed,\r\nmaking great sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would depart\r\nfrom the court, and took his leave of King Arthur. Nay, said the king,\r\nI suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship, I suppose\r\nye are displeased that I have shewed you unkindness; blame me the less,\r\nfor I was misinformed against you, but I weened ye had not been such a\r\nknight as ye are, of worship and prowess, and if ye will abide in this\r\ncourt among my fellowship, I shall so advance you as ye shall be\r\npleased. God thank your highness, said Balin, your bounty and highness\r\nmay no man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs\r\ndepart, beseeching you alway of your good grace. Truly, said the king,\r\nI am right wroth for your departing; I pray you, fair knight, that ye\r\ntarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome to me, and to my barons,\r\nand I shall amend all miss that I have done against you; God thank your\r\ngreat lordship, said Balin, and therewith made him ready to depart.\r\nThen the most part of the knights of the Round Table said that Balin\r\ndid not this adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How the Lady of the Lake demanded the knight\xe2\x80\x99s head that\r\nhad won the sword, or the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nThe meanwhile, that this knight was making him ready to depart, there\r\ncame into the court a lady that hight the Lady of the Lake. And she\r\ncame on horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there\r\nasked him a gift that he promised her when she gave him the sword. That\r\nis sooth, said Arthur, a gift I promised you, but I have forgotten the\r\nname of my sword that ye gave me. The name of it, said the lady, is\r\nExcalibur, that is as much to say as Cut-steel. Ye say well, said the\r\nking; ask what ye will and ye shall have it, an it lie in my power to\r\ngive it. Well, said the lady, I ask the head of the knight that hath\r\nwon the sword, or else the damosel\xe2\x80\x99s head that brought it; I take no\r\nforce though I have both their heads, for he slew my brother, a good\r\nknight and a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath. Truly, said King Arthur, I may not grant neither of their heads\r\nwith my worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil\r\nyour desire. I will ask none other thing, said the lady. When Balin was\r\nready to depart, he saw the Lady of the Lake, that by her means had\r\nslain Balin\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and he had sought her three years; and when it\r\nwas told him that she asked his head of King Arthur, he went to her\r\nstraight and said, Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and\r\ntherefore ye shall lose yours, and with his sword lightly he smote off\r\nher head before King Arthur. Alas, for shame! said Arthur, why have ye\r\ndone so? ye have shamed me and all my court, for this was a lady that I\r\nwas beholden to, and hither she came under my safe-conduct; I shall\r\nnever forgive you that trespass. Sir, said Balin, me forthinketh of\r\nyour displeasure, for this same lady was the untruest lady living, and\r\nby enchantment and sorcery she hath been the destroyer of many good\r\nknights, and she was causer that my mother was burnt, through her\r\nfalsehood and treachery. What cause soever ye had, said Arthur, ye\r\nshould have forborne her in my presence; therefore, think not the\r\ncontrary, ye shall repent it, for such another despite had I never in\r\nmy court; therefore withdraw you out of my court in all haste ye may.\r\n\r\nThen Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him to his\r\nhostelry, and there he met with his squire, that was sorry he had\r\ndispleased King Arthur and so they rode forth out of the town. Now,\r\nsaid Balin, we must depart, take thou this head and bear it to my\r\nfriends, and tell them how I have sped, and tell my friends in\r\nNorthumberland that my most foe is dead. Also tell them how I am out of\r\nprison, and what adventure befell me at the getting of this sword.\r\nAlas! said the squire, ye are greatly to blame for to displease King\r\nArthur. As for that, said Balin, I will hie me, in all the haste that I\r\nmay, to meet with King Rience and destroy him, either else to die\r\ntherefore; and if it may hap me to win him, then will King Arthur be my\r\ngood and gracious lord. Where shall I meet with you? said the squire.\r\nIn King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, said Balin. So his squire and he departed at\r\nthat time. Then King Arthur and all the court made great dole and had\r\nshame of the death of the Lady of the Lake. Then the king buried her\r\nrichly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel.\r\n\r\nAt that time there was a knight, the which was the king\xe2\x80\x99s son of\r\nIreland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight,\r\nand counted himself one of the best of the court; and he had great\r\ndespite at Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be\r\naccounted more hardy, or more of prowess; and he asked King Arthur if\r\nhe would give him leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite\r\nthat he had done. Do your best, said Arthur, I am right wroth with\r\nBalin; I would he were quit of the despite that he hath done to me and\r\nto my court. Then this Lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready.\r\nIn the meanwhile came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there\r\nwas told him the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of\r\nthe Lake. Now shall I say you, said Merlin; this same damosel that here\r\nstandeth, that brought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the\r\ncause of her coming: she was the falsest damosel that liveth. Say not\r\nso, said they. She hath a brother, a passing good knight of prowess and\r\na full true man; and this damosel loved another knight that held her to\r\nparamour, and this good knight her brother met with the knight that\r\nheld her to paramour, and slew him by force of his hands. When this\r\nfalse damosel understood this, she went to the Lady Lile of Avelion,\r\nand besought her of help, to be avenged on her own brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland, and\r\nhow he jousted and slew him.\r\n\r\nAnd so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her this sword that she brought\r\nwith her, and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if\r\nhe be one of the best knights of this realm, and he should be hard and\r\nfull of prowess, and with that sword he should slay her brother. This\r\nwas the cause that the damosel came into this court. I know it as well\r\nas ye. Would God she had not come into this court, but she came never\r\nin fellowship of worship to do good, but always great harm; and that\r\nknight that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword,\r\nfor the which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of\r\nmore prowess than he is, and he shall do unto you, my Lord Arthur,\r\ngreat honour and kindness; and it is great pity he shall not endure but\r\na while, for of his strength and hardiness I know not his match living.\r\n\r\nSo the knight of Ireland armed him at all points, and dressed his\r\nshield on his shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his spear\r\nin his hand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his horse might\r\ngo; and within a little space on a mountain he had a sight of Balin,\r\nand with a loud voice he cried, Abide, knight, for ye shall abide\r\nwhether ye will or nill, and the shield that is to-fore you shall not\r\nhelp. When Balin heard the noise, he turned his horse fiercely, and\r\nsaid, Fair knight, what will ye with me, will ye joust with me? Yea,\r\nsaid the Irish knight, therefore come I after you. Peradventure, said\r\nBalin, it had been better to have holden you at home, for many a man\r\nweeneth to put his enemy to a rebuke, and oft it falleth to himself. Of\r\nwhat court be ye sent from? said Balin. I am come from the court of\r\nKing Arthur, said the knight of Ireland, that come hither for to\r\nrevenge the despite ye did this day to King Arthur and to his court.\r\nWell, said Balin, I see well I must have ado with you, that me\r\nforthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of his court; and your\r\nquarrel is full simple, said Balin, unto me, for the lady that is dead,\r\ndid me great damage, and else would I have been loath as any knight\r\nthat liveth for to slay a lady. Make you ready, said the knight\r\nLanceor, and dress you unto me, for that one shall abide in the field.\r\nThen they took their spears, and came together as much as their horses\r\nmight drive, and the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that all\r\nwent shivers off his spear, and Balin hit him through the shield, and\r\nthe hauberk perished, and so pierced through his body and the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncroup, and anon turned his horse fiercely, and drew out his sword, and\r\nwist not that he had slain him; and then he saw him lie as a dead\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How a damosel, which was love to Lanceor, slew herself for\r\nlove, and how Balin met with his brother Balan.\r\n\r\nThen he looked by him, and was ware of a damosel that came riding full\r\nfast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey. And when she espied\r\nthat Lanceor was slain, she made sorrow out of measure, and said, O\r\nBalin, two bodies thou hast slain and one heart, and two hearts in one\r\nbody, and two souls thou hast lost. And therewith she took the sword\r\nfrom her love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon. And\r\nwhen she arose she made great dole out of measure, the which sorrow\r\ngrieved Balin passingly sore, and he went unto her for to have taken\r\nthe sword out of her hand, but she held it so fast he might not take it\r\nout of her hand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she set\r\nthe pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body. When Balin\r\nespied her deeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and ashamed that\r\nso fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love of his death.\r\nAlas, said Balin, me repenteth sore the death of this knight, for the\r\nlove of this damosel, for there was much true love betwixt them both,\r\nand for sorrow might not longer behold him, but turned his horse and\r\nlooked toward a great forest, and there he was ware, by the arms, of\r\nhis brother Balan. And when they were met they put off their helms and\r\nkissed together, and wept for joy and pity. Then Balan said, I little\r\nweened to have met with you at this sudden adventure; I am right glad\r\nof your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment, for a man told me,\r\nin the castle of Four Stones, that ye were delivered, and that man had\r\nseen you in the court of King Arthur, and therefore I came hither into\r\nthis country, for here I supposed to find you. Anon the knight Balin\r\ntold his brother of his adventure of the sword, and of the death of the\r\nLady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was displeased with him.\r\nWherefore he sent this knight after me, that lieth here dead, and the\r\ndeath of this damosel grieveth me sore. So doth it me, said Balan, but\r\nye must take the adventure that God will ordain you. Truly, said Balin,\r\nI am right heavy that my Lord Arthur is displeased with me, for he is\r\nthe most worshipful knight that reigneth now on earth, and his love\r\nwill I get or else will I put my life in adventure. For the King Rience\r\nlieth at a siege at the Castle Terrabil, and thither will we draw in\r\nall haste, to prove our worship and prowess upon him. I will well, said\r\nBalan, that we do, and we will help each other as brethren ought to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How a dwarf reproved Balin for the death of Lanceor, and\r\nhow King Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.\r\n\r\nNow go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met. The meanwhile as they\r\ntalked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on horseback, as\r\nmuch as he might; and found the dead bodies, wherefore he made great\r\ndole, and pulled out his hair for sorrow, and said, Which of you\r\nknights have done this deed? Whereby askest thou it? said Balan. For I\r\nwould wit it, said the dwarf. It was I, said Balin, that slew this\r\nknight in my defence, for hither he came to chase me, and either I must\r\nslay him or he me; and this damosel slew herself for his love, which\r\nrepenteth me, and for her sake I shall owe all women the better love.\r\nAlas, said the dwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for\r\nthis knight that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men that\r\nlived, and trust well, Balin, the kin of this knight will chase you\r\nthrough the world till they have slain you. As for that, said Balin, I\r\nfear not greatly, but I am right heavy that I have displeased my lord\r\nKing Arthur, for the death of this knight. So as they talked together,\r\nthere came a king of Cornwall riding, the which hight King Mark. And\r\nwhen he saw these two bodies dead, and understood how they were dead,\r\nby the two knights above said, then made the king great sorrow for the\r\ntrue love that was betwixt them, and said, I will not depart till I\r\nhave on this earth made a tomb, and there he pight his pavilions and\r\nsought through all the country to find a tomb, and in a church they\r\nfound one was fair and rich, and then the king let put them both in the\r\nearth, and put the tomb upon them, and wrote the names of them both on\r\nthe tomb. How here lieth Lanceor the king\xe2\x80\x99s son of Ireland, that at his\r\nown request was slain by the hands of Balin; and how his lady, Colombe,\r\nand paramour, slew herself with her love\xe2\x80\x99s sword for dole and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How Merlin prophesied that two the best knights of the\r\nworld should fight there, which were Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nThe meanwhile as this was a-doing, in came Merlin to King Mark, and\r\nseeing all his doing, said, Here shall be in this same place the\r\ngreatest battle betwixt two knights that was or ever shall be, and the\r\ntruest lovers, and yet none of them shall slay other. And there Merlin\r\nwrote their names upon the tomb with letters of gold that should fight\r\nin that place, whose names were Launcelot de Lake, and Tristram. Thou\r\nart a marvellous man, said King Mark unto Merlin, that speakest of such\r\nmarvels, thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds.\r\nWhat is thy name? said King Mark. At this time, said Merlin, I will not\r\ntell, but at that time when Sir Tristram is taken with his sovereign\r\nlady, then ye shall hear and know my name, and at that time ye shall\r\nhear tidings that shall not please you. Then said Merlin to Balin, Thou\r\nhast done thyself great hurt, because that thou savest not this lady\r\nthat slew herself, that might have saved her an thou wouldest. By the\r\nfaith of my body, said Balin, I might not save her, for she slew\r\nherself suddenly. Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of\r\nthat lady thou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man\r\nstruck, except the stroke of our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest\r\nknight and the man of most worship that now liveth, and through that\r\nstroke three kingdoms shall be in great poverty, misery and\r\nwretchedness twelve years, and the knight shall not be whole of that\r\nwound for many years. Then Merlin took his leave of Balin. And Balin\r\nsaid, If I wist it were sooth that ye say I should do such a perilous\r\ndeed as that, I would slay myself to make thee a liar. Therewith Merlin\r\nvanished away suddenly. And then Balan and his brother took their leave\r\nof King Mark. First, said the king, tell me your name. Sir, said Balan,\r\nye may see he beareth two swords, thereby ye may call him the Knight\r\nwith the Two Swords. And so departed King Mark unto Camelot to King\r\nArthur, and Balin took the way toward King Rience; and as they rode\r\ntogether they met with Merlin disguised, but they knew him not. Whither\r\nride you? said Merlin. We have little to do, said the two knights, to\r\ntell thee. But what is thy name? said Balin. At this time, said Merlin,\r\nI will not tell it thee. It is evil seen, said the knights, that thou\r\nart a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name. As for that, said\r\nMerlin, be it as it be may, I can tell you wherefore ye ride this way,\r\nfor to meet King Rience; but it will not avail you without ye have my\r\ncounsel. Ah! said Balin, ye are Merlin; we will be ruled by your\r\ncounsel. Come on, said Merlin, ye shall have great worship, and look\r\nthat ye do knightly, for ye shall have great need. As for that, said\r\nBalin, dread you not, we will do what we may.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How Balin and his brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took\r\nKing Rience and brought him to King Arthur.\r\n\r\nThen Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the highway, and\r\ntook off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid\r\nthem down to rest them till it was nigh midnight. Then Merlin bade them\r\nrise, and make them ready, for the king was nigh them, that was stolen\r\naway from his host with a three score horses of his best knights, and\r\ntwenty of them rode to-fore to warn the Lady de Vance that the king was\r\ncoming; for that night King Rience should have lain with her. Which is\r\nthe king? said Balin. Abide, said Merlin, here in a strait way ye shall\r\nmeet with him; and therewith he showed Balin and his brother where he\r\nrode.\r\n\r\nAnon Balin and his brother met with the king, and smote him down, and\r\nwounded him fiercely, and laid him to the ground; and there they slew\r\non the right hand and the left hand, and slew more than forty of his\r\nmen, and the remnant fled. Then went they again to King Rience and\r\nwould have slain him had he not yielded him unto their grace. Then said\r\nhe thus: Knights full of prowess, slay me not, for by my life ye may\r\nwin, and by my death ye shall win nothing. Then said these two knights,\r\nYe say sooth and truth, and so laid him on a horse-litter. With that\r\nMerlin was vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and told him\r\nhow his most enemy was taken and discomfited. By whom? said King\r\nArthur. By two knights, said Merlin, that would please your lordship,\r\nand to-morrow ye shall know what knights they are. Anon after came the\r\nKnight with the Two Swords and Balan his brother, and brought with them\r\nKing Rience of North Wales, and there delivered him to the porters, and\r\ncharged them with him; and so they two returned again in the dawning of\r\nthe day. King Arthur came then to King Rience, and said, Sir king, ye\r\nare welcome: by what adventure come ye hither? Sir, said King Rience, I\r\ncame hither by an hard adventure. Who won you? said King Arthur. Sir,\r\nsaid the king, the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which\r\nare two marvellous knights of prowess. I know them not, said Arthur,\r\nbut much I am beholden to them. Ah, said Merlin, I shall tell you: it\r\nis Balin that achieved the sword, and his brother Balan, a good knight,\r\nthere liveth not a better of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be\r\nthe greatest dole of him that ever I knew of knight, for he shall not\r\nlong endure. Alas, said King Arthur, that is great pity; for I am much\r\nbeholden unto him, and I have ill deserved it unto him for his\r\nkindness. Nay, said Merlin, he shall do much more for you, and that\r\nshall ye know in haste. But, sir, are ye purveyed, said Merlin, for\r\nto-morn the host of Nero, King Rience\xe2\x80\x99s brother, will set on you or\r\nnoon with a great host, and therefore make you ready, for I will depart\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How King Arthur had a battle against Nero and King Lot of\r\nOrkney, and how King Lot was deceived by Merlin, and how twelve kings\r\nwere slain.\r\n\r\nThen King Arthur made ready his host in ten battles and Nero was ready\r\nin the field afore the Castle Terrabil with a great host, and he had\r\nten battles, with many more people than Arthur had. Then Nero had the\r\nvanguard with the most part of his people, and Merlin came to King Lot\r\nof the Isle of Orkney, and held him with a tale of prophecy, till Nero\r\nand his people were destroyed. And there Sir Kay the seneschal did\r\npassingly well, that the days of his life the worship went never from\r\nhim; and Sir Hervis de Revel did marvellous deeds with King Arthur, and\r\nKing Arthur slew that day twenty knights and maimed forty. At that time\r\ncame in the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan, but they\r\ntwo did so marvellously that the king and all the knights marvelled of\r\nthem, and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as\r\nangels, or devils from hell; and King Arthur said himself they were the\r\nbest knights that ever he saw, for they gave such strokes that all men\r\nhad wonder of them.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile came one to King Lot, and told him while he tarried\r\nthere Nero was destroyed and slain with all his people. Alas, said King\r\nLot, I am ashamed, for by my default there is many a worshipful man\r\nslain, for an we had been together there had been none host under the\r\nheaven that had been able for to have matched with us; this faiter with\r\nhis prophecy hath mocked me. All that did Merlin, for he knew well that\r\nan King Lot had been with his body there at the first battle, King\r\nArthur had been slain, and all his people destroyed; and well Merlin\r\nknew that one of the kings should be dead that day, and loath was\r\nMerlin that any of them both should be slain; but of the twain, he had\r\nliefer King Lot had been slain than King Arthur. Now what is best to\r\ndo? said King Lot of Orkney; whether is me better to treat with King\r\nArthur or to fight, for the greater part of our people are slain and\r\ndestroyed? Sir, said a knight, set on Arthur for they are weary and\r\nforfoughten and we be fresh. As for me, said King Lot, I would every\r\nknight would do his part as I would do mine. And then they advanced\r\nbanners and smote together and all to-shivered their spears; and\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights, with the help of the Knight with the Two Swords and\r\nhis brother Balan put King Lot and his host to the worse. But always\r\nKing Lot held him in the foremost front, and did marvellous deeds of\r\narms, for all his host was borne up by his hands, for he abode all\r\nknights. Alas he might not endure, the which was great pity, that so\r\nworthy a knight as he was one should be overmatched, that of late time\r\nafore had been a knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, and wedded the sister of King\r\nArthur; and for King Arthur lay by King Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife, the which was\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and gat on her Mordred, therefore King Lot held\r\nagainst Arthur. So there was a knight that was called the Knight with\r\nthe Strange Beast, and at that time his right name was called\r\nPellinore, the which was a good man of prowess, and he smote a mighty\r\nstroke at King Lot as he fought with all his enemies, and he failed of\r\nhis stroke, and smote the horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck, that he fell to the ground with\r\nKing Lot. And therewith anon Pellinore smote him a great stroke through\r\nthe helm and head unto the brows. And then all the host of Orkney fled\r\nfor the death of King Lot, and there were slain many mothers\xe2\x80\x99 sons. But\r\nKing Pellinore bare the wite of the death of King Lot, wherefore Sir\r\nGawaine revenged the death of his father the tenth year after he was\r\nmade knight, and slew King Pellinore with his own hands. Also there\r\nwere slain at that battle twelve kings on the side of King Lot with\r\nNero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s in Camelot,\r\nand the remnant of knights and of others were buried in a great rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. Of the interment of twelve kings, and of the prophecy of\r\nMerlin, and how Balin should give the dolorous stroke.\r\n\r\nSo at the interment came King Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife Margawse with her four sons,\r\nGawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth. Also there came thither King\r\nUriens, Sir Ewaine\xe2\x80\x99s father, and Morgan le Fay his wife that was King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s sister. All these came to the interment. But of all these\r\ntwelve kings King Arthur let make the tomb of King Lot passing richly,\r\nand made his tomb by his own; and then Arthur let make twelve images of\r\nlatten and copper, and over-gilt it with gold, in the sign of twelve\r\nkings, and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt day and\r\nnight; and King Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing above them\r\nwith a sword drawn in his hand, and all the twelve figures had\r\ncountenance like unto men that were overcome. All this made Merlin by\r\nhis subtle craft, and there he told the king, When I am dead these\r\ntapers shall burn no longer, and soon after the adventures of the\r\nSangreal shall come among you and be achieved. Also he told Arthur how\r\nBalin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke, whereof\r\nshall fall great vengeance. Oh, where is Balin and Balan and Pellinore?\r\nsaid King Arthur. As for Pellinore, said Merlin, he will meet with you\r\nsoon; and as for Balin he will not be long from you; but the other\r\nbrother will depart, ye shall see him no more. By my faith, said\r\nArthur, they are two marvellous knights, and namely Balin passeth of\r\nprowess of any knight that ever I found, for much beholden am I unto\r\nhim; would God he would abide with me. Sir, said Merlin, look ye keep\r\nwell the scabbard of Excalibur, for ye shall lose no blood while ye\r\nhave the scabbard upon you, though ye have as many wounds upon you as\r\nye may have. So after, for great trust, Arthur betook the scabbard to\r\nMorgan le Fay his sister, and she loved another knight better than her\r\nhusband King Uriens or King Arthur, and she would have had Arthur her\r\nbrother slain, and therefore she let make another scabbard like it by\r\nenchantment, and gave the scabbard Excalibur to her love; and the\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s name was called Accolon, that after had near slain King\r\nArthur. After this Merlin told unto King Arthur of the prophecy that\r\nthere should be a great battle beside Salisbury, and Mordred his own\r\nson should be against him. Also he told him that Bagdemegus was his\r\ncousin, and germain unto King Uriens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How a sorrowful knight came before Arthur, and how Balin\r\nfetched him, and how that knight was slain by a knight invisible.\r\n\r\nWithin a day or two King Arthur was somewhat sick, and he let pitch his\r\npavilion in a meadow, and there he laid him down on a pallet to sleep,\r\nbut he might have no rest. Right so he heard a great noise of an horse,\r\nand therewith the king looked out at the porch of the pavilion, and saw\r\na knight coming even by him, making great dole. Abide, fair sir, said\r\nArthur, and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow. Ye may little\r\namend me, said the knight, and so passed forth to the castle of Meliot.\r\nAnon after there came Balin, and when he saw King Arthur he alighted\r\noff his horse, and came to the King on foot, and saluted him. By my\r\nhead, said Arthur, ye be welcome. Sir, right now came riding this way a\r\nknight making great mourn, for what cause I cannot tell; wherefore I\r\nwould desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch\r\nagain that knight either by force or else by his good will. I will do\r\nmore for your lordship than that, said Balin; and so he rode more than\r\na pace, and found the knight with a damosel in a forest, and said, Sir\r\nknight, ye must come with me unto King Arthur, for to tell him of your\r\nsorrow. That will I not, said the knight, for it will scathe me\r\ngreatly, and do you none avail. Sir, said Balin, I pray you make you\r\nready, for ye must go with me, or else I must fight with you and bring\r\nyou by force, and that were me loath to do. Will ye be my warrant, said\r\nthe knight, an I go with you? Yea, said Balin, or else I will die\r\ntherefore. And so he made him ready to go with Balin, and left the\r\ndamosel still. And as they were even afore King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion,\r\nthere came one invisible, and smote this knight that went with Balin\r\nthroughout the body with a spear. Alas, said the knight, I am slain\r\nunder your conduct with a knight called Garlon; therefore take my horse\r\nthat is better than yours, and ride to the damosel, and follow the\r\nquest that I was in as she will lead you, and revenge my death when ye\r\nmay. That shall I do, said Balin, and that I make vow unto knighthood;\r\nand so he departed from this knight with great sorrow. So King Arthur\r\nlet bury this knight richly, and made a mention on his tomb, how there\r\nwas slain Herlews le Berbeus, and by whom the treachery was done, the\r\nknight Garlon. But ever the damosel bare the truncheon of the spear\r\nwith her that Sir Herlews was slain withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How Balin and the damosel met with a knight which was in\r\nlikewise slain, and how the damosel bled for the custom of a castle.\r\n\r\nSo Balin and the damosel rode into a forest, and there met with a\r\nknight that had been a-hunting, and that knight asked Balin for what\r\ncause he made so great sorrow. Me list not to tell you, said Balin.\r\nNow, said the knight, an I were armed as ye be I would fight with you.\r\nThat should little need, said Balin, I am not afeard to tell you, and\r\ntold him all the cause how it was. Ah, said the knight, is this all?\r\nhere I ensure you by the faith of my body never to depart from you\r\nwhile my life lasteth. And so they went to the hostelry and armed them,\r\nand so rode forth with Balin. And as they came by an hermitage even by\r\na churchyard, there came the knight Garlon invisible, and smote this\r\nknight, Perin de Mountbeliard, through the body with a spear. Alas,\r\nsaid the knight, I am slain by this traitor knight that rideth\r\ninvisible. Alas, said Balin, it is not the first despite he hath done\r\nme; and there the hermit and Balin buried the knight under a rich stone\r\nand a tomb royal. And on the morn they found letters of gold written,\r\nhow Sir Gawaine shall revenge his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, King Lot, on the King\r\nPellinore. Anon after this Balin and the damosel rode till they came to\r\na castle, and there Balin alighted, and he and the damosel went to go\r\ninto the castle, and anon as Balin came within the castle\xe2\x80\x99s gate the\r\nportcullis fell down at his back, and there fell many men about the\r\ndamosel, and would have slain her. When Balin saw that, he was sore\r\naggrieved, for he might not help the damosel. Then he went up into the\r\ntower, and leapt over walls into the ditch, and hurt him not; and anon\r\nhe pulled out his sword and would have foughten with them. And they all\r\nsaid nay, they would not fight with him, for they did nothing but the\r\nold custom of the castle; and told him how their lady was sick, and had\r\nlain many years, and she might not be whole but if she had a dish of\r\nsilver full of blood of a clean maid and a king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter; and\r\ntherefore the custom of this castle is, there shall no damosel pass\r\nthis way but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full. Well,\r\nsaid Balin, she shall bleed as much as she may bleed, but I will not\r\nlose the life of her whiles my life lasteth. And so Balin made her to\r\nbleed by her good will, but her blood helped not the lady. And so he\r\nand she rested there all night, and had there right good cheer, and on\r\nthe morn they passed on their ways. And as it telleth after in the\r\nSangreal, that Sir Percivale\xe2\x80\x99s sister helped that lady with her blood,\r\nwhereof she was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast,\r\nand there he slew him, to have his blood to heal therewith the son of\r\nhis host.\r\n\r\nThen they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and by\r\nhap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at\r\nease. And as they sat at their supper Balin overheard one complain\r\ngrievously by him in a chair. What is this noise? said Balin. Forsooth,\r\nsaid his host, I will tell you. I was but late at a jousting, and there\r\nI jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice\r\nsmote I him down, and then he promised to quit me on my best friend;\r\nand so he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and he rideth alway invisible; but I know not his name.\r\nAh! said Balin, I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he hath slain\r\ntwo knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I had liefer meet\r\nwith that knight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he\r\nhath done me. Well, said his host, I shall tell you, King Pellam of\r\nListeneise hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that\r\nshall be within these twenty days, and no knight may come there but if\r\nhe bring his wife with him, or his paramour; and that knight, your\r\nenemy and mine, ye shall see that day. Then I behote you, said Balin,\r\npart of his blood to heal your son withal. We will be forward to-morn,\r\nsaid his host. So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and\r\nthey had fifteen days\xe2\x80\x99 journey or they came thither; and that same day\r\nbegan the great feast. And so they alighted and stabled their horses,\r\nand went into the castle; but Balin\xe2\x80\x99s host might not be let in because\r\nhe had no lady. Then Balin was well received and brought unto a chamber\r\nand unarmed him; and there were brought him robes to his pleasure, and\r\nwould have had Balin leave his sword behind him. Nay, said Balin, that\r\ndo I not, for it is the custom of my country a knight always to keep\r\nhis weapon with him, and that custom will I keep, or else I will depart\r\nas I came. Then they gave him leave to wear his sword, and so he went\r\nunto the castle, and was set among knights of worship, and his lady\r\nafore him.\r\n\r\nSoon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court whose\r\nname is Garlon? Yonder he goeth, said a knight, he with the black face;\r\nhe is the marvellest knight that is now living, for he destroyeth many\r\ngood knights, for he goeth invisible. Ah well, said Balin, is that he?\r\nThen Balin advised him long: If I slay him here I shall not escape, and\r\nif I leave him now, peradventure I shall never meet with him again at\r\nsuch a steven, and much harm he will do an he live. Therewith this\r\nGarlon espied that this Balin beheld him, and then he came and smote\r\nBalin on the face with the back of his hand, and said, Knight, why\r\nbeholdest me so? for shame therefore, eat thy meat and do that thou\r\ncame for. Thou sayest sooth, said Balin, this is not the first despite\r\nthat thou hast done me, and therefore I will do what I came for, and\r\nrose up fiercely and clave his head to the shoulders. Give me the\r\ntruncheon, said Balin to his lady, wherewith he slew your knight. Anon\r\nshe gave it him, for alway she bare the truncheon with her. And\r\ntherewith Balin smote him through the body, and said openly, With that\r\ntruncheon thou hast slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy\r\nbody. And then Balin called unto him his host, saying, Now may ye fetch\r\nblood enough to heal your son withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How Balin fought with King Pellam, and how his sword brake,\r\nand how he gat a spear wherewith he smote the dolorous stroke.\r\n\r\nAnon all the knights arose from the table for to set on Balin, and King\r\nPellam himself arose up fiercely, and said, Knight, hast thou slain my\r\nbrother? thou shalt die therefore or thou depart. Well, said Balin, do\r\nit yourself. Yes, said King Pellam, there shall no man have ado with\r\nthee but myself, for the love of my brother. Then King Pellam caught in\r\nhis hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the\r\nsword betwixt his head and the stroke, and therewith his sword burst in\r\nsunder. And when Balin was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seek\r\nsome weapon, and so from chamber to chamber, and no weapon he could\r\nfind, and always King Pellam after him. And at the last he entered into\r\na chamber that was marvellously well dight and richly, and a bed\r\narrayed with cloth of gold, the richest that might be thought, and one\r\nlying therein, and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four\r\npillars of silver that bare up the table, and upon the table stood a\r\nmarvellous spear strangely wrought. And when Balin saw that spear, he\r\ngat it in his hand and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him\r\npassingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon,\r\nand therewith the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth,\r\nand Balin fell down so that he might not stir foot nor hand. And so the\r\nmost part of the castle, that was fallen down through that dolorous\r\nstroke, lay upon Pellam and Balin three days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight that\r\nwould have slain himself for love.\r\n\r\nThen Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him a good horse,\r\nfor his was dead, and bade him ride out of that country. I would have\r\nmy damosel, said Balin. Lo, said Merlin, where she lieth dead. And King\r\nPellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and might never be whole till\r\nGalahad the haut prince healed him in the quest of the Sangreal, for in\r\nthat place was part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph\r\nof Arimathea brought into this land, and there himself lay in that rich\r\nbed. And that was the same spear that Longius smote our Lord to the\r\nheart; and King Pellam was nigh of Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s kin, and that was the most\r\nworshipful man that lived in those days, and great pity it was of his\r\nhurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole, tray and tene.\r\nThen departed Balin from Merlin, and said, In this world we meet never\r\nno more. So he rode forth through the fair countries and cities, and\r\nfound the people dead, slain on every side. And all that were alive\r\ncried, O Balin, thou hast caused great damage in these countries; for\r\nthe dolorous stroke thou gavest unto King Pellam three countries are\r\ndestroyed, and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the\r\nlast. When Balin was past those countries he was passing fain.\r\n\r\nSo he rode eight days or he met with adventure. And at the last he came\r\ninto a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there\r\nbeside he saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside\r\nsat a fair knight on the ground and made great mourning, and he was a\r\nlikely man, and a well made. Balin said, God save you, why be ye so\r\nheavy? tell me and I will amend it, an I may, to my power. Sir knight,\r\nsaid he again, thou dost me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts,\r\nand now thou puttest me to more pain. Balin went a little from him, and\r\nlooked on his horse; then heard Balin him say thus: Ah, fair lady, why\r\nhave ye broken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by\r\nnoon, and I may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with\r\nthis sword I slay myself, and pulled it out. And therewith Balin stert\r\nunto him and took him by the hand. Let go my hand, said the knight, or\r\nelse I shall slay thee. That shall not need, said Balin, for I shall\r\npromise you my help to get you your lady, an ye will tell me where she\r\nis. What is your name? said the knight. My name is Balin le Savage. Ah,\r\nsir, I know you well enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and\r\nthe man of most prowess of your hands living. What is your name? said\r\nBalin. My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s son, but by my\r\nprowess and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands;\r\nhis name is Duke Hermel, and his daughter is she that I love, and she\r\nme as I deemed. How far is she hence? said Balin. But six mile, said\r\nthe knight. Now ride we hence, said these two knights. So they rode\r\nmore than a pace, till that they came to a fair castle well walled and\r\nditched. I will into the castle, said Balin, and look if she be there.\r\nSo he went in and searched from chamber to chamber, and found her bed,\r\nbut she was not there. Then Balin looked into a fair little garden, and\r\nunder a laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and a\r\nknight in her arms, fast halsing either other, and under their heads\r\ngrass and herbs. When Balin saw her lie so with the foulest knight that\r\never he saw, and she a fair lady, then Balin went through all the\r\nchambers again, and told the knight how he found her as she had slept\r\nfast, and so brought him in the place there she lay fast sleeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How that knight slew his love and a knight lying by her,\r\nand after, how he slew himself with his own sword, and how Balin rode\r\ntoward a castle where he lost his life.\r\n\r\nAnd when Garnish beheld her so lying, for pure sorrow his mouth and\r\nnose burst out a-bleeding, and with his sword he smote off both their\r\nheads, and then he made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, much\r\nsorrow hast thou brought unto me, for hadst thou not shewed me that\r\nsight I should have passed my sorrow. Forsooth, said Balin, I did it to\r\nthis intent that it should better thy courage, and that ye might see\r\nand know her falsehood, and to cause you to leave love of such a lady;\r\nGod knoweth I did none other but as I would ye did to me. Alas, said\r\nGarnish, now is my sorrow double that I may not endure, now have I\r\nslain that I most loved in all my life; and therewith suddenly he rove\r\nhimself on his own sword unto the hilts. When Balin saw that, he\r\ndressed him thenceward, lest folk would say he had slain them; and so\r\nhe rode forth, and within three days he came by a cross, and thereon\r\nwere letters of gold written, that said, It is not for no knight alone\r\nto ride toward this castle. Then saw he an old hoar gentleman coming\r\ntoward him, that said, Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds to come\r\nthis way, therefore turn again and it will avail thee. And he vanished\r\naway anon; and so he heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a\r\nbeast. That blast, said Balin, is blown for me, for I am the prize and\r\nyet am I not dead. Anon withal he saw an hundred ladies and many\r\nknights, that welcomed him with fair semblant, and made him passing\r\ngood cheer unto his sight, and led him into the castle, and there was\r\ndancing and minstrelsy and all manner of joy. Then the chief lady of\r\nthe castle said, Knight with the Two Swords, ye must have ado and joust\r\nwith a knight hereby that keepeth an island, for there may no man pass\r\nthis way but he must joust or he pass. That is an unhappy custom, said\r\nBalin, that a knight may not pass this way but if he joust. Ye shall\r\nnot have ado but with one knight, said the lady.\r\n\r\nWell, said Balin, since I shall thereto I am ready, but travelling men\r\nare oft weary and their horses too, but though my horse be weary my\r\nheart is not weary, I would be fain there my death should be. Sir, said\r\na knight to Balin, methinketh your shield is not good, I will lend you\r\na bigger. Thereof I pray you. And so he took the shield that was\r\nunknown and left his own, and so rode unto the island, and put him and\r\nhis horse in a great boat; and when he came on the other side he met\r\nwith a damosel, and she said, O knight Balin, why have ye left your own\r\nshield? alas ye have put yourself in great danger, for by your shield\r\nye should have been known; it is great pity of you as ever was of\r\nknight, for of thy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellow living. Me\r\nrepenteth, said Balin, that ever I came within this country, but I may\r\nnot turn now again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to me, be\r\nit life or death, I will take the adventure that shall come to me. And\r\nthen he looked on his armour, and understood he was well armed, and\r\ntherewith blessed him and mounted upon his horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Balin met with his brother Balan, and how each of\r\nthem slew other unknown, till they were wounded to death.\r\n\r\nThen afore him he saw come riding out of a castle a knight, and his\r\nhorse trapped all red, and himself in the same colour. When this knight\r\nin the red beheld Balin, him thought it should be his brother Balin by\r\ncause of his two swords, but by cause he knew not his shield he deemed\r\nit was not he. And so they aventryd their spears and came marvellously\r\nfast together, and they smote each other in the shields, but their\r\nspears and their course were so big that it bare down horse and man,\r\nthat they lay both in a swoon. But Balin was bruised sore with the fall\r\nof his horse, for he was weary of travel. And Balan was the first that\r\nrose on foot and drew his sword, and went toward Balin, and he arose\r\nand went against him; but Balan smote Balin first, and he put up his\r\nshield and smote him through the shield and tamed his helm. Then Balin\r\nsmote him again with that unhappy sword, and well-nigh had felled his\r\nbrother Balan, and so they fought there together till their breaths\r\nfailed. Then Balin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand\r\nfull of ladies. So they went unto battle again, and wounded everych\r\nother dolefully, and then they breathed ofttimes, and so went unto\r\nbattle that all the place there as they fought was blood red. And at\r\nthat time there was none of them both but they had either smitten other\r\nseven great wounds, so that the least of them might have been the death\r\nof the mightiest giant in this world.\r\n\r\nThen they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to\r\nhear of that battle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks\r\nunnailed that naked they were on every side. At last Balan the younger\r\nbrother withdrew him a little and laid him down. Then said Balin le\r\nSavage, What knight art thou? for or now I found never no knight that\r\nmatched me. My name is, said he, Balan, brother unto the good knight,\r\nBalin. Alas, said Balin, that ever I should see this day, and therewith\r\nhe fell backward in a swoon. Then Balan yede on all four feet and\r\nhands, and put off the helm off his brother, and might not know him by\r\nthe visage it was so ful hewn and bled; but when he awoke he said, O\r\nBalan, my brother, thou hast slain me and I thee, wherefore all the\r\nwide world shall speak of us both. Alas, said Balan, that ever I saw\r\nthis day, that through mishap I might not know you, for I espied well\r\nyour two swords, but by cause ye had another shield I deemed ye had\r\nbeen another knight. Alas, said Balin, all that made an unhappy knight\r\nin the castle, for he caused me to leave my own shield to our both\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndestruction, and if I might live I would destroy that castle for ill\r\ncustoms. That were well done, said Balan, for I had never grace to\r\ndepart from them since that I came hither, for here it happed me to\r\nslay a knight that kept this island, and since might I never depart,\r\nand no more should ye, brother, an ye might have slain me as ye have,\r\nand escaped yourself with the life.\r\n\r\nRight so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies\r\nand six yeomen unto them, and there she heard how they made their moan\r\neither to other, and said, We came both out of one tomb, that is to say\r\none mother\xe2\x80\x99s belly, and so shall we lie both in one pit. So Balan\r\nprayed the lady of her gentleness, for his true service, that she would\r\nbury them both in that same place there the battle was done. And she\r\ngranted them, with weeping, it should be done richly in the best\r\nmanner. Now, will ye send for a priest, that we may receive our\r\nsacrament, and receive the blessed body of our Lord Jesus Christ? Yea,\r\nsaid the lady, it shall be done; and so she sent for a priest and gave\r\nthem their rights. Now, said Balin, when we are buried in one tomb, and\r\nthe mention made over us how two brethren slew each other, there will\r\nnever good knight, nor good man, see our tomb but they will pray for\r\nour souls. And so all the ladies and gentlewomen wept for pity. Then\r\nanon Balan died, but Balin died not till the midnight after, and so\r\nwere they buried both, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he\r\nwas there slain by his brother\xe2\x80\x99s hands, but she knew not Balin\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How Merlin buried them both in one tomb, and of Balin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nIn the morn came Merlin and let write Balin\xe2\x80\x99s name on the tomb with\r\nletters of gold, that Here lieth Balin le Savage that was the Knight\r\nwith the Two Swords, and he that smote the Dolorous Stroke. Also Merlin\r\nlet make there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he\r\nwent out of his wit, yet Launcelot de Lake fordid that bed through his\r\nnoblesse. And anon after Balin was dead, Merlin took his sword, and\r\ntook off the pommel and set on another pommel. So Merlin bade a knight\r\nthat stood afore him handle that sword, and he assayed, and he might\r\nnot handle it. Then Merlin laughed. Why laugh ye? said the knight. This\r\nis the cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this sword but\r\nthe best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Launcelot or else\r\nGalahad his son, and Launcelot with this sword shall slay the man that\r\nin the world he loved best, that shall be Sir Gawaine. All this he let\r\nwrite in the pommel of the sword. Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron\r\nand of steel into that island, and it was but half a foot broad, and\r\nthere shall never man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over,\r\nbut if he were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery\r\nor villainy. Also the scabbard of Balin\xe2\x80\x99s sword Merlin left it on this\r\nside the island, that Galahad should find it. Also Merlin let make by\r\nhis subtilty that Balin\xe2\x80\x99s sword was put in a marble stone standing\r\nupright as great as a mill stone, and the stone hoved always above the\r\nwater and did many years, and so by adventure it swam down the stream\r\nto the City of Camelot, that is in English Winchester. And that same\r\nday Galahad the haut prince came with King Arthur, and so Galahad\r\nbrought with him the scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in\r\nthe marble stone hoving upon the water. And on Whitsunday he achieved\r\nthe sword as it is rehearsed in the book of Sangreal.\r\n\r\nSoon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him of the\r\ndolorous stroke that Balin gave to King Pellam, and how Balin and Balan\r\nfought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of, and how\r\nthey were buried both in one tomb. Alas, said King Arthur, this is the\r\ngreatest pity that ever I heard tell of two knights, for in the world I\r\nknow not such two knights. Thus endeth the tale of Balin and of Balan,\r\ntwo brethren born in Northumberland, good knights.\r\n\r\nSequitur iii. liber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How King Arthur took a wife, and wedded Guenever, daughter\r\nto Leodegrance, King of the Land of Cameliard, with whom he had the\r\nRound Table.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of Arthur, after he was chosen king by adventure and\r\nby grace; for the most part of the barons knew not that he was Uther\r\nPendragon\xe2\x80\x99s son, but as Merlin made it openly known. But yet many kings\r\nand lords held great war against him for that cause, but well Arthur\r\novercame them all, for the most part the days of his life he was ruled\r\nmuch by the counsel of Merlin. So it fell on a time King Arthur said\r\nunto Merlin, My barons will let me have no rest, but needs I must take\r\na wife, and I will none take but by thy counsel and by thine advice. It\r\nis well done, said Merlin, that ye take a wife, for a man of your\r\nbounty and noblesse should not be without a wife. Now is there any that\r\nye love more than another? Yea, said King Arthur, I love Guenever the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Leodegrance of the land of Cameliard, the which\r\nholdeth in his house the Table Round that ye told he had of my father\r\nUther. And this damosel is the most valiant and fairest lady that I\r\nknow living, or yet that ever I could find. Sir, said Merlin, as of her\r\nbeauty and fairness she is one of the fairest alive, but, an ye loved\r\nher not so well as ye do, I should find you a damosel of beauty and of\r\ngoodness that should like you and please you, an your heart were not\r\nset; but there as a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart is set, he will be loath to return.\r\nThat is truth, said King Arthur. But Merlin warned the king covertly\r\nthat Guenever was not wholesome for him to take to wife, for he warned\r\nhim that Launcelot should love her, and she him again; and so he turned\r\nhis tale to the adventures of Sangreal.\r\n\r\nThen Merlin desired of the king for to have men with him that should\r\nenquire of Guenever, and so the king granted him, and Merlin went forth\r\nunto King Leodegrance of Cameliard, and told him of the desires of the\r\nking that he would have unto his wife Guenever his daughter. That is to\r\nme, said King Leodegrance, the best tidings that ever I heard, that so\r\nworthy a king of prowess and noblesse will wed my daughter. And as for\r\nmy lands, I will give him, wist I it might please him, but he hath\r\nlands enow, him needeth none; but I shall send him a gift shall please\r\nhim much more, for I shall give him the Table Round, the which Uther\r\nPendragon gave me, and when it is full complete, there is an hundred\r\nknights and fifty. And as for an hundred good knights I have myself,\r\nbut I faute fifty, for so many have been slain in my days. And so\r\nLeodegrance delivered his daughter Guenever unto Merlin, and the Table\r\nRound with the hundred knights, and so they rode freshly, with great\r\nroyalty, what by water and what by land, till that they came nigh unto\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How the Knights of the Round Table were ordained and their\r\nsieges blessed by the Bishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nWhen King Arthur heard of the coming of Guenever and the hundred\r\nknights with the Table Round, then King Arthur made great joy for her\r\ncoming, and that rich present, and said openly, This fair lady is\r\npassing welcome unto me, for I have loved her long, and therefore there\r\nis nothing so lief to me. And these knights with the Round Table please\r\nme more than right great riches. And in all haste the king let ordain\r\nfor the marriage and the coronation in the most honourable wise that\r\ncould be devised. Now, Merlin, said King Arthur, go thou and espy me in\r\nall this land fifty knights which be of most prowess and worship.\r\nWithin short time Merlin had found such knights that should fulfil\r\ntwenty and eight knights, but no more he could find. Then the Bishop of\r\nCanterbury was fetched, and he blessed the sieges with great royalty\r\nand devotion, and there set the eight and twenty knights in their\r\nsieges. And when this was done Merlin said, Fair sirs, ye must all\r\narise and come to King Arthur for to do him homage; he will have the\r\nbetter will to maintain you. And so they arose and did their homage,\r\nand when they were gone Merlin found in every sieges letters of gold\r\nthat told the knights\xe2\x80\x99 names that had sitten therein. But two sieges\r\nwere void. And so anon came young Gawaine and asked the king a gift.\r\nAsk, said the king, and I shall grant it you. Sir, I ask that ye will\r\nmake me knight that same day ye shall wed fair Guenever. I will do it\r\nwith a good will, said King Arthur, and do unto you all the worship\r\nthat I may, for I must by reason ye are my nephew, my sister\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired King Arthur\r\nto make his son knight.\r\n\r\nForthwithal there came a poor man into the court, and brought with him\r\na fair young man of eighteen years of age riding upon a lean mare; and\r\nthe poor man asked all men that he met, Where shall I find King Arthur?\r\nYonder he is, said the knights, wilt thou anything with him? Yea, said\r\nthe poor man, therefore I came hither. Anon as he came before the king,\r\nhe saluted him and said: O King Arthur, the flower of all knights and\r\nkings, I beseech Jesu save thee. Sir, it was told me that at this time\r\nof your marriage ye would give any man the gift that he would ask, out\r\nexcept that were unreasonable. That is truth, said the king, such cries\r\nI let make, and that will I hold, so it apair not my realm nor mine\r\nestate. Ye say well and graciously, said the poor man; Sir, I ask\r\nnothing else but that ye will make my son here a knight. It is a great\r\nthing thou askest of me, said the king. What is thy name? said the king\r\nto the poor man. Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd. Whether cometh this\r\nof thee or of thy son? said the king. Nay, sir, said Aries, this desire\r\ncometh of my son and not of me, for I shall tell you I have thirteen\r\nsons, and all they will fall to what labour I put them, and will be\r\nright glad to do labour, but this child will not labour for me, for\r\nanything that my wife or I may do, but always he will be shooting or\r\ncasting darts, and glad for to see battles and to behold knights, and\r\nalways day and night he desireth of me to be made a knight. What is thy\r\nname? said the king unto the young man. Sir, my name is Tor. The king\r\nbeheld him fast, and saw he was passingly well-visaged and passingly\r\nwell made of his years. Well, said King Arthur unto Aries the cowherd,\r\nfetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them. And so the poor man\r\ndid, and all were shaped much like the poor man. But Tor was not like\r\nnone of them all in shape nor in countenance, for he was much more than\r\nany of them. Now, said King Arthur unto the cow herd, where is the\r\nsword he shall be made knight withal? It is here, said Tor. Take it out\r\nof the sheath, said the king, and require me to make you a knight.\r\n\r\nThen Tor alighted off his mare and pulled out his sword, kneeling, and\r\nrequiring the king that he would make him knight, and that he might be\r\na knight of the Table Round. As for a knight I will make you, and\r\ntherewith smote him in the neck with the sword, saying, Be ye a good\r\nknight, and so I pray to God so ye may be, and if ye be of prowess and\r\nof worthiness ye shall be a knight of the Table Round. Now Merlin, said\r\nArthur, say whether this Tor shall be a good knight or no. Yea, sir, he\r\nought to be a good knight, for he is come of as good a man as any is\r\nalive, and of kings\xe2\x80\x99 blood. How so, sir? said the king. I shall tell\r\nyou, said Merlin: This poor man, Aries the cowherd, is not his father;\r\nhe is nothing sib to him, for King Pellinore is his father. I suppose\r\nnay, said the cowherd. Fetch thy wife afore me, said Merlin, and she\r\nshall not say nay. Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair\r\nhousewife, and there she answered Merlin full womanly, and there she\r\ntold the king and Merlin that when she was a maid, and went to milk\r\nkine, there met with her a stern knight, and half by force he had my\r\nmaidenhead, and at that time he begat my son Tor, and he took away from\r\nme my greyhound that I had that time with me, and said that he would\r\nkeep the greyhound for my love. Ah, said the cowherd, I weened not\r\nthis, but I may believe it well, for he had never no tatches of me.\r\nSir, said Tor unto Merlin, dishonour not my mother. Sir, said Merlin,\r\nit is more for your worship than hurt, for your father is a good man\r\nand a king, and he may right well advance you and your mother, for ye\r\nwere begotten or ever she was wedded. That is truth, said the wife. It\r\nis the less grief unto me, said the cowherd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Tor was known for son of King Pellinore, and how\r\nGawaine was made knight.\r\n\r\nSo on the morn King Pellinore came to the court of King Arthur, which\r\nhad great joy of him, and told him of Tor, how he was his son, and how\r\nhe had made him knight at the request of the cowherd. When Pellinore\r\nbeheld Tor, he pleased him much. So the king made Gawaine knight, but\r\nTor was the first he made at the feast. What is the cause, said King\r\nArthur, that there be two places void in the sieges? Sir, said Merlin,\r\nthere shall no man sit in those places but they that shall be of most\r\nworship. But in the Siege Perilous there shall no man sit therein but\r\none, and if there be any so hardy to do it he shall be destroyed, and\r\nhe that shall sit there shall have no fellow. And therewith Merlin took\r\nKing Pellinore by the hand, and in the one hand next the two sieges and\r\nthe Siege Perilous he said, in open audience, This is your place and\r\nbest ye are worthy to sit therein of any that is here. Thereat sat Sir\r\nGawaine in great envy and told Gaheris his brother, yonder knight is\r\nput to great worship, the which grieveth me sore, for he slew our\r\nfather King Lot, therefore I will slay him, said Gawaine, with a sword\r\nthat was sent me that is passing trenchant. Ye shall not so, said\r\nGaheris, at this time, for at this time I am but a squire, and when I\r\nam made knight I will be avenged on him, and therefore, brother, it is\r\nbest ye suffer till another time, that we may have him out of the\r\ncourt, for an we did so we should trouble this high feast. I will well,\r\nsaid Gawaine, as ye will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How at feast of the wedding of King Arthur to Guenever, a\r\nwhite hart came into the hall, and thirty couple hounds, and how a\r\nbrachet pinched the hart which was taken away.\r\n\r\nThen was the high feast made ready, and the king was wedded at Camelot\r\nunto Dame Guenever in the church of Saint Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s, with great\r\nsolemnity. And as every man was set after his degree, Merlin went to\r\nall the knights of the Round Table, and bade them sit still, that none\r\nof them remove. For ye shall see a strange and a marvellous adventure.\r\nRight so as they sat there came running in a white hart into the hall,\r\nand a white brachet next him, and thirty couple of black running hounds\r\ncame after with a great cry, and the hart went about the Table Round as\r\nhe went by other boards. The white brachet bit him by the buttock and\r\npulled out a piece, wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and\r\noverthrew a knight that sat at the board side; and therewith the knight\r\narose and took up the brachet, and so went forth out of the hall, and\r\ntook his horse and rode his way with the brachet. Right so anon came in\r\na lady on a white palfrey, and cried aloud to King Arthur, Sir, suffer\r\nme not to have this despite, for the brachet was mine that the knight\r\nled away. I may not do therewith, said the king.\r\n\r\nWith this there came a knight riding all armed on a great horse, and\r\ntook the lady away with him with force, and ever she cried and made\r\ngreat dole. When she was gone the king was glad, for she made such a\r\nnoise. Nay, said Merlin, ye may not leave these adventures so lightly;\r\nfor these adventures must be brought again or else it would be\r\ndisworship to you and to your feast. I will, said the king, that all be\r\ndone by your advice. Then, said Merlin, let call Sir Gawaine, for he\r\nmust bring again the white hart. Also, sir, ye must let call Sir Tor,\r\nfor he must bring again the brachet and the knight, or else slay him.\r\nAlso let call King Pellinore, for he must bring again the lady and the\r\nknight, or else slay him. And these three knights shall do marvellous\r\nadventures or they come again. Then were they called all three as it\r\nrehearseth afore, and each of them took his charge, and armed them\r\nsurely. But Sir Gawaine had the first request, and therefore we will\r\nbegin at him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Gawaine rode for to fetch again the hart, and how\r\ntwo brethren fought each against other for the hart.\r\n\r\nSir Gawaine rode more than a pace, and Gaheris his brother that rode\r\nwith him instead of a squire to do him service. So as they rode they\r\nsaw two knights fight on horseback passing sore, so Sir Gawaine and his\r\nbrother rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought\r\nso. The one knight answered and said, We fight for a simple matter, for\r\nwe two be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman.\r\nAlas, said Sir Gawaine, why do ye so? Sir, said the elder, there came a\r\nwhite hart this way this day, and many hounds chased him, and a white\r\nbrachet was alway next him, and we understood it was adventure made for\r\nthe high feast of King Arthur, and therefore I would have gone after to\r\nhave won me worship; and here my younger brother said he would go after\r\nthe hart, for he was better knight than I: and for this cause we fell\r\nat debate, and so we thought to prove which of us both was better\r\nknight. This is a simple cause, said Sir Gawaine; uncouth men ye should\r\ndebate withal, and not brother with brother; therefore but if you will\r\ndo by my counsel I will have ado with you, that is ye shall yield you\r\nunto me, and that ye go unto King Arthur and yield you unto his grace.\r\nSir knight, said the two brethren, we are forfoughten and much blood\r\nhave we lost through our wilfulness, and therefore we would be loath to\r\nhave ado with you. Then do as I will have you, said Sir Gawaine. We\r\nwill agree to fulfil your will; but by whom shall we say that we be\r\nthither sent? Ye may say, By the knight that followeth the quest of the\r\nhart that was white. Now what is your name? said Gawaine. Sorlouse of\r\nthe Forest, said the elder. And my name is, said the younger, Brian of\r\nthe Forest. And so they departed and went to the king\xe2\x80\x99s court, and Sir\r\nGawaine on his quest.\r\n\r\nAnd as Gawaine followed the hart by the cry of the hounds, even afore\r\nhim there was a great river, and the hart swam over; and as Sir Gawaine\r\nwould follow after, there stood a knight over the other side, and said,\r\nSir knight, come not over after this hart but if thou wilt joust with\r\nme. I will not fail as for that, said Sir Gawaine, to follow the quest\r\nthat I am in, and so made his horse to swim over the water. And anon\r\nthey gat their spears and ran together full hard; but Sir Gawaine smote\r\nhim off his horse, and then he turned his horse and bade him yield him.\r\nNay, said the knight, not so, though thou have the better of me on\r\nhorseback. I pray thee, valiant knight, alight afoot, and match we\r\ntogether with swords. What is your name? said Sir Gawaine. Allardin of\r\nthe Isles, said the other. Then either dressed their shields and smote\r\ntogether, but Sir Gawaine smote him so hard through the helm that it\r\nwent to the brains, and the knight fell down dead. Ah! said Gaheris,\r\nthat was a mighty stroke of a young knight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII How the hart was chased into a castle and there slain, and\r\nhow Sir Gawaine slew a lady.\r\n\r\nThen Gawaine and Gaheris rode more than a pace after the white hart,\r\nand let slip at the hart three couple of greyhounds, and so they chased\r\nthe hart into a castle, and in the chief place of the castle they slew\r\nthe hart; Sir Gawaine and Gaheris followed after. Right so there came a\r\nknight out of a chamber with a sword drawn in his hand and slew two of\r\nthe greyhounds, even in the sight of Sir Gawaine, and the remnant he\r\nchased them with his sword out of the castle. And when he came again,\r\nhe said, O my white hart, me repenteth that thou art dead, for my\r\nsovereign lady gave thee to me, and evil have I kept thee, and thy\r\ndeath shall be dear bought an I live. And anon he went into his chamber\r\nand armed him, and came out fiercely, and there met he with Sir\r\nGawaine. Why have ye slain my hounds? said Sir Gawaine, for they did\r\nbut their kind, and liefer I had ye had wroken your anger upon me than\r\nupon a dumb beast. Thou sayest truth, said the knight, I have avenged\r\nme on thy hounds, and so I will on thee or thou go. Then Sir Gawaine\r\nalighted afoot and dressed his shield, and struck together mightily,\r\nand clave their shields, and stoned their helms, and brake their\r\nhauberks that the blood ran down to their feet.\r\n\r\nAt the last Sir Gawaine smote the knight so hard that he fell to the\r\nearth, and then he cried mercy, and yielded him, and besought him as he\r\nwas a knight and gentleman, to save his life. Thou shalt die, said Sir\r\nGawaine, for slaying of my hounds. I will make amends, said the knight,\r\nunto my power. Sir Gawaine would no mercy have, but unlaced his helm to\r\nhave stricken off his head. Right so came his lady out of a chamber and\r\nfell over him, and so he smote off her head by misadventure. Alas, said\r\nGaheris, that is foully and shamefully done, that shame shall never\r\nfrom you; also ye should give mercy unto them that ask mercy, for a\r\nknight without mercy is without worship. Sir Gawaine was so stonied of\r\nthe death of this fair lady that he wist not what he did, and said unto\r\nthe knight, Arise, I will give thee mercy. Nay, nay, said the knight, I\r\ntake no force of mercy now, for thou hast slain my love and my lady\r\nthat I loved best of all earthly things. Me sore repenteth it, said Sir\r\nGawaine, for I thought to strike unto thee; but now thou shalt go unto\r\nKing Arthur and tell him of thine adventures, and how thou art overcome\r\nby the knight that went in the quest of the white hart. I take no\r\nforce, said the knight, whether I live or I die; but so for dread of\r\ndeath he swore to go unto King Arthur, and he made him to bear one\r\ngreyhound before him on his horse, and another behind him. What is your\r\nname? said Sir Gawaine, or we depart. My name is, said the knight,\r\nAblamar of the Marsh. So he departed toward Camelot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How four knights fought against Gawaine and Gaheris, and\r\nhow they were overcome, and their lives saved at request of four\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Gawaine went into the castle, and made him ready to lie there\r\nall night, and would have unarmed him. What will ye do, said Gaheris,\r\nwill ye unarm you in this country? Ye may think ye have many enemies\r\nhere. They had not sooner said that word but there came four knights\r\nwell armed, and assailed Sir Gawaine hard, and said unto him, Thou\r\nnew-made knight, thou hast shamed thy knighthood, for a knight without\r\nmercy is dishonoured. Also thou hast slain a fair lady to thy great\r\nshame to the world\xe2\x80\x99s end, and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need\r\nof mercy or thou depart from us. And therewith one of them smote Sir\r\nGawaine a great stroke that nigh he fell to the earth, and Gaheris\r\nsmote him again sore, and so they were on the one side and on the\r\nother, that Sir Gawaine and Gaheris were in jeopardy of their lives;\r\nand one with a bow, an archer, smote Sir Gawaine through the arm that\r\nit grieved him wonderly sore. And as they should have been slain, there\r\ncame four fair ladies, and besought the knights of grace for Sir\r\nGawaine; and goodly at request of the ladies they gave Sir Gawaine and\r\nGaheris their lives, and made them to yield them as prisoners. Then\r\nGawaine and Gaheris made great dole. Alas! said Sir Gawaine, mine arm\r\ngrieveth me sore, I am like to be maimed; and so made his complaint\r\npiteously.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morrow there came to Sir Gawaine one of the four ladies\r\nthat had heard all his complaint, and said, Sir knight, what cheer? Not\r\ngood, said he. It is your own default, said the lady, for ye have done\r\na passing foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great\r\nvillainy unto you. But be ye not of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s kin? said the lady.\r\nYes truly, said Sir Gawaine. What is your name? said the lady, ye must\r\ntell it me or ye pass. My name is Gawaine, the King Lot of Orkney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson, and my mother is King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Ah! then are ye nephew unto\r\nKing Arthur, said the lady, and I shall so speak for you that ye shall\r\nhave conduct to go to King Arthur for his love. And so she departed and\r\ntold the four knights how their prisoner was King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, and\r\nhis name is Sir Gawaine, King Lot\xe2\x80\x99s son of Orkney. And they gave him\r\nthe hart\xe2\x80\x99s head because it was in his quest. Then anon they delivered\r\nSir Gawaine under this promise, that he should bear the dead lady with\r\nhim in this manner; the head of her was hanged about his neck, and the\r\nwhole body of her lay before him on his horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane. Right so rode he\r\nforth unto Camelot. And anon as he was come, Merlin desired of King\r\nArthur that Sir Gawaine should be sworn to tell of all his adventures,\r\nand how he slew the lady, and how he would give no mercy unto the\r\nknight, wherethrough the lady was slain. Then the king and the queen\r\nwere greatly displeased with Sir Gawaine for the slaying of the lady.\r\nAnd there by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on\r\nSir Gawaine, and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with all\r\nladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he should be\r\ncourteous, and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy. Thus was\r\nGawaine sworn upon the Four Evangelists that he should never be against\r\nlady nor gentlewoman, but if he fought for a lady and his adversary\r\nfought for another. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawaine that\r\nhe did at the marriage of King Arthur. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Tor rode after the knight with the brachet, and of\r\nhis adventure by the way.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Tor was ready, he mounted upon his horseback, and rode after\r\nthe knight with the brachet. So as he rode he met with a dwarf suddenly\r\nthat smote his horse on the head with a staff, that he went backward\r\nhis spear length. Why dost thou so? said Sir Tor. For thou shalt not\r\npass this way, but if thou joust with yonder knights of the pavilions.\r\nThen was Tor ware where two pavilions were, and great spears stood out,\r\nand two shields hung on trees by the pavilions. I may not tarry, said\r\nSir Tor, for I am in a quest that I must needs follow. Thou shalt not\r\npass, said the dwarf, and therewithal he blew his horn. Then there came\r\none armed on horseback, and dressed his shield, and came fast toward\r\nTor, and he dressed him against him, and so ran together that Tor bare\r\nhim from his horse. And anon the knight yielded him to his mercy. But,\r\nsir, I have a fellow in yonder pavilion that will have ado with you\r\nanon. He shall be welcome, said Sir Tor. Then was he ware of another\r\nknight coming with great raundon, and each of them dressed to other,\r\nthat marvel it was to see; but the knight smote Sir Tor a great stroke\r\nin midst of the shield that his spear all to-shivered. And Sir Tor\r\nsmote him through the shield below of the shield that it went through\r\nthe cost of the knight, but the stroke slew him not. And therewith Sir\r\nTor alighted and smote him on the helm a great stroke, and therewith\r\nthe knight yielded him and besought him of mercy. I will well, said Sir\r\nTor, but thou and thy fellow must go unto King Arthur, and yield you\r\nprisoners unto him. By whom shall we say are we thither sent? Ye shall\r\nsay by the knight that went in the quest of the knight that went with\r\nthe brachet. Now, what be your two names? said Sir Tor. My name is,\r\nsaid the one, Sir Felot of Langduk; and my name is, said the other, Sir\r\nPetipase of Winchelsea. Now go ye forth, said Sir Tor, and God speed\r\nyou and me. Then came the dwarf and said unto Sir Tor, I pray you give\r\nme a gift. I will well, said Sir Tor, ask. I ask no more, said the\r\ndwarf, but that ye will suffer me to do you service, for I will serve\r\nno more recreant knights. Take an horse, said Sir Tor, and ride on with\r\nme. I wot ye ride after the knight with the white brachet, and I shall\r\nbring you where he is, said the dwarf. And so they rode throughout a\r\nforest, and at the last they were ware of two pavilions, even by a\r\npriory, with two shields, and the one shield was enewed with white, and\r\nthe other shield was red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Tor found the brachet with a lady, and how a knight\r\nassailed him for the said brachet.\r\n\r\nTherewith Sir Tor alighted and took the dwarf his glaive, and so he\r\ncame to the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it, on one\r\npallet, sleeping, and so he went to the other pavilion, and found a\r\nlady lying sleeping therein, but there was the white brachet that bayed\r\nat her fast, and therewith the lady yede out of the pavilion and all\r\nher damosels. But anon as Sir Tor espied the white brachet, he took her\r\nby force and took her to the dwarf. What, will ye so, said the lady,\r\ntake my brachet from me? Yea, said Sir Tor, this brachet have I sought\r\nfrom King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court hither. Well, said the lady, knight, ye shall\r\nnot go far with her, but that ye shall be met and grieved. I shall\r\nabide what adventure that cometh by the grace of God, and so mounted\r\nupon his horse, and passed on his way toward Camelot; but it was so\r\nnear night he might not pass but little further. Know ye any lodging?\r\nsaid Tor. I know none, said the dwarf, but here beside is an hermitage,\r\nand there ye must take lodging as ye find. And within a while they came\r\nto the hermitage and took lodging; and was there grass, oats and bread\r\nfor their horses; soon it was sped, and full hard was their supper; but\r\nthere they rested them all night till on the morn, and heard a mass\r\ndevoutly, and took their leave of the hermit, and Sir Tor prayed the\r\nhermit to pray for him. He said he would, and betook him to God. And so\r\nmounted upon horseback and rode towards Camelot a long while.\r\n\r\nWith that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and he\r\nsaid, Knight, abide and yield my brachet that thou took from my lady.\r\nSir Tor returned again, and beheld him how he was a seemly knight and\r\nwell horsed, and well armed at all points; then Sir Tor dressed his\r\nshield, and took his spear in his hands, and the other came fiercely\r\nupon him, and smote both horse and man to the earth. Anon they arose\r\nlightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions, and put their\r\nshields afore them, and smote through the shields, that the cantels\r\nfell off both parties. Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood\r\nran out, and the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in\r\nsunder that the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many\r\nwounds and were passing weary. But Sir Tor espied that the other knight\r\nfainted, and then he sued fast upon him, and doubled his strokes, and\r\ngart him go to the earth on the one side. Then Sir Tor bade him yield\r\nhim. That will I not, said Abelleus, while my life lasteth and the soul\r\nis within my body, unless that thou wilt give me the brachet. That will\r\nI not do, said Sir Tor, for it was my quest to bring again thy brachet,\r\nthee, or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he lost his head\r\nat the request of a lady.\r\n\r\nWith that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she might\r\ndrive, and cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor. What will ye with me?\r\nsaid Sir Tor. I beseech thee, said the damosel, for King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s love,\r\ngive me a gift; I require thee, gentle knight, as thou art a gentleman.\r\nNow, said Tor, ask a gift and I will give it you. Gramercy, said the\r\ndamosel; now I ask the head of the false knight Abelleus, for he is the\r\nmost outrageous knight that liveth, and the greatest murderer. I am\r\nloath, said Sir Tor, of that gift I have given you; let him make amends\r\nin that he hath trespassed unto you. Now, said the damosel, he may not,\r\nfor he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was a better\r\nknight than he, an he had had grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore\r\nhim in the mire for to save my brother\xe2\x80\x99s life, that had done him no\r\ndamage, but fought with him by adventure of arms, and so for all that I\r\ncould do he struck off his head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art\r\na true knight, to give me my gift, or else I shall shame thee in all\r\nthe court of King Arthur; for he is the falsest knight living, and a\r\ngreat destroyer of good knights. Then when Abelleus heard this, he was\r\nmore afeard, and yielded him and asked mercy. I may not now, said Sir\r\nTor, but if I should be found false of my promise; for while I would\r\nhave taken you to mercy ye would none ask, but if ye had the brachet\r\nagain, that was my quest. And therewith he took off his helm, and he\r\narose and fled, and Sir Tor after him, and smote off his head quite.\r\n\r\nNow sir, said the damosel, it is near night; I pray you come and lodge\r\nwith me here at my place, it is here fast by. I will well, said Sir\r\nTor, for his horse and he had fared evil since they departed from\r\nCamelot, and so he rode with her, and had passing good cheer with her;\r\nand she had a passing fair old knight to her husband that made him\r\npassing good cheer, and well eased both his horse and him. And on the\r\nmorn he heard his mass, and brake his fast, and took his leave of the\r\nknight and of the lady, that besought him to tell them his name. Truly,\r\nhe said, my name is Sir Tor that was late made knight, and this was the\r\nfirst quest of arms that ever I did, to bring again that this knight\r\nAbelleus took away from King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court. O fair knight, said the\r\nlady and her husband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our\r\npoor lodging, and it shall be always at your commandment. So Sir Tor\r\ndeparted and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and the king and\r\nthe queen and all the court was passing fain of his coming, and made\r\ngreat joy that he was come again; for he went from the court with\r\nlittle succour, but as King Pellinore his father gave him an old\r\ncourser, and King Arthur gave him armour and a sword, and else had he\r\nnone other succour, but rode so forth himself alone. And then the king\r\nand the queen by Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s advice made him to swear to tell of his\r\nadventures, and so he told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore\r\nrehearsed, wherefore the king and the queen made great joy. Nay, nay,\r\nsaid Merlin, these be but japes to that he shall do; for he shall prove\r\na noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living, and gentle and\r\ncourteous, and of good tatches, and passing true of his promise, and\r\nnever shall outrage. Wherethrough Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s words King Arthur gave him\r\nan earldom of lands that fell unto him. And here endeth the quest of\r\nSir Tor, King Pellinore\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How King Pellinore rode after the lady and the knight that\r\nled her away, and how a lady desired help of him, and how he fought\r\nwith two knights for that lady, of whom he slew the one at the first\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\nThen King Pellinore armed him and mounted upon his horse, and rode more\r\nthan a pace after the lady that the knight led away. And as he rode in\r\na forest, he saw in a valley a damosel sit by a well, and a wounded\r\nknight in her arms, and Pellinore saluted her. And when she was ware of\r\nhim, she cried overloud, Help me, knight; for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, King\r\nPellinore. And he would not tarry, he was so eager in his quest, and\r\never she cried an hundred times after help. When she saw he would not\r\nabide, she prayed unto God to send him as much need of help as she had,\r\nand that he might feel it or he died. So, as the book telleth, the\r\nknight there died that there was wounded, wherefore the lady for pure\r\nsorrow slew herself with his sword. As King Pellinore rode in that\r\nvalley he met with a poor man, a labourer. Sawest thou not, said\r\nPellinore, a knight riding and leading away a lady? Yea, said the man,\r\nI saw that knight, and the lady that made great dole; and yonder\r\nbeneath in a valley there shall ye see two pavilions, and one of the\r\nknights of the pavilions challenged that lady of that knight, and said\r\nshe was his cousin near, wherefore he should lead her no farther. And\r\nso they waged battle in that quarrel, the one said he would have her by\r\nforce, and the other said he would have the rule of her, by cause he\r\nwas her kinsman, and would lead her to her kin. For this quarrel he\r\nleft them fighting. And if ye will ride a pace ye shall find them\r\nfighting, and the lady was beleft with the two squires in the\r\npavilions. God thank thee, said King Pellinore.\r\n\r\nThen he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two pavilions, and the\r\ntwo knights fighting. Anon he rode unto the pavilions, and saw the lady\r\nthat was his quest, and said, Fair lady, ye must go with me unto the\r\ncourt of King Arthur. Sir knight, said the two squires that were with\r\nher, yonder are two knights that fight for this lady, go thither and\r\ndepart them, and be agreed with them, and then may ye have her at your\r\npleasure. Ye say well, said King Pellinore. And anon he rode betwixt\r\nthem, and departed them, and asked them the causes why that they\r\nfought? Sir knight, said the one, I shall tell you, this lady is my\r\nkinswoman nigh, mine aunt\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and when I heard her complain\r\nthat she was with him maugre her head, I waged battle to fight with\r\nhim. Sir knight, said the other, whose name was Hontzlake of Wentland,\r\nand this lady I gat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\nThat is untruly said, said King Pellinore, for ye came in suddenly\r\nthere as we were at the high feast, and took away this lady or any man\r\nmight make him ready; and therefore it was my quest to bring her again\r\nand you both, or else the one of us to abide in the field; therefore\r\nthe lady shall go with me, or I will die for it, for I have promised it\r\nKing Arthur. And therefore fight ye no more, for none of you shall have\r\nno part of her at this time; and if ye list to fight for her, fight\r\nwith me, and I will defend her. Well, said the knights, make you ready,\r\nand we shall assail you with all our power. And as King Pellinore would\r\nhave put his horse from them, Sir Hontzlake rove his horse through with\r\na sword, and said: Now art thou on foot as well as we are. When King\r\nPellinore espied that his horse was slain, lightly he leapt from his\r\nhorse and pulled out his sword, and put his shield afore him, and said,\r\nKnight, keep well thy head, for thou shalt have a buffet for the\r\nslaying of my horse. So King Pellinore gave him such a stroke upon the\r\nhelm that he clave the head down to the chin, that he fell to the earth\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her to\r\nCamelot to the court of King Arthur.\r\n\r\nAnd then he turned him to the other knight, that was sore wounded. But\r\nwhen he saw the other\xe2\x80\x99s buffet, he would not fight, but kneeled down\r\nand said, Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I\r\nrequire you, as ye be a true knight, put her to no shame nor villainy.\r\nWhat, said King Pellinore, will ye not fight for her? No, sir, said the\r\nknight, I will not fight with such a knight of prowess as ye be. Well,\r\nsaid Pellinore, ye say well; I promise you she shall have no villainy\r\nby me, as I am true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said\r\nPellinore, but I will have Hontzlake\xe2\x80\x99s horse. Ye shall not need, said\r\nthe knight, for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so\r\nthat you will lodge with me, for it is near night. I will well, said\r\nKing Pellinore, abide with you all night. And there he had with him\r\nright good cheer, and fared of the best with passing good wine, and had\r\nmerry rest that night. And on the morn he heard a mass and dined; and\r\nthen was brought him a fair bay courser, and King Pellinore\xe2\x80\x99s saddle\r\nset upon him. Now, what shall I call you? said the knight, inasmuch as\r\nye have my cousin at your desire of your quest. Sir, I shall tell you,\r\nmy name is King Pellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round.\r\nNow I am glad, said the knight, that such a noble man shall have the\r\nrule of my cousin. Now, what is your name? said Pellinore, I pray you\r\ntell me. Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my cousin\r\nhight Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn\r\nbrother, a passing good knight, and his name is Brian of the Isles, and\r\nhe is full loath to do wrong, and full loath to fight with any man, but\r\nif he be sore sought on, so that for shame he may not leave it. It is\r\nmarvel, said Pellinore, that he will not have ado with me. Sir, he will\r\nnot have ado with no man but if it be at his request. Bring him to the\r\ncourt, said Pellinore, one of these days. Sir, we will come together.\r\nAnd ye shall be welcome, said Pellinore, to the court of King Arthur,\r\nand greatly allowed for your coming. And so he departed with the lady,\r\nand brought her to Camelot.\r\n\r\nSo as they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse stumbled and threw her down, that her arm was sore bruised and\r\nnear she swooned for pain. Alas! sir, said the lady, mine arm is out of\r\nlithe, wherethrough I must needs rest me. Ye shall well, said King\r\nPellinore. And so he alighted under a fair tree where was fair grass,\r\nand he put his horse thereto, and so laid him under the tree and slept\r\ntill it was nigh night. And when he awoke he would have ridden. Sir,\r\nsaid the lady, it is so dark that ye may as well ride backward as\r\nforward. So they abode still and made there their lodging. Then Sir\r\nPellinore put off his armour; then a little afore midnight they heard\r\nthe trotting of an horse. Be ye still, said King Pellinore, for we\r\nshall hear of some adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How on the way he heard two knights, as he lay by night in\r\na valley, and of their adventures.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith he armed him. So right even afore him there met two\r\nknights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the north,\r\nand either saluted other. What tidings at Camelot? said the one. By my\r\nhead, said the other, there have I been and espied the court of King\r\nArthur, and there is such a fellowship they may never be broken, and\r\nwell-nigh all the world holdeth with Arthur, for there is the flower of\r\nchivalry. Now for this cause I am riding into the north, to tell our\r\nchieftains of the fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur. As\r\nfor that, said the other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that\r\nis the greatest poison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot will\r\nI with it, for we have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and well\r\ncherished, that shall poison King Arthur; for so he hath promised our\r\nchieftains, and received great gifts for to do it. Beware, said the\r\nother knight, of Merlin, for he knoweth all things by the devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncraft. Therefore will I not let it, said the knight. And so they\r\ndeparted asunder. Anon after Pellinore made him ready, and his lady,\r\n[and] rode toward Camelot; and as they came by the well there as the\r\nwounded knight was and the lady, there he found the knight, and the\r\nlady eaten with lions or wild beasts, all save the head, wherefore he\r\nmade great sorrow, and wept passing sore, and said, Alas! her life\r\nmight I have saved; but I was so fierce in my quest, therefore I would\r\nnot abide. Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady. I wot not, said\r\nPellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her, for she was\r\na passing fair lady and a young. Now, will ye do by mine advice? said\r\nthe lady, take this knight and let him be buried in an hermitage, and\r\nthen take the lady\xe2\x80\x99s head and bear it with you unto Arthur. So King\r\nPellinore took this dead knight on his shoulders, and brought him to\r\nthe hermitage, and charged the hermit with the corpse, that service\r\nshould be done for the soul; and take his harness for your pain. It\r\nshall be done, said the hermit, as I will answer unto God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How when he was come to Camelot he was sworn upon a book to\r\ntell the truth of his quest.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith they departed, and came there as the head of the lady lay\r\nwith a fair yellow hair that grieved King Pellinore passingly sore when\r\nhe looked on it, for much he cast his heart on the visage. And so by\r\nnoon they came to Camelot; and the king and the queen were passing fain\r\nof his coming to the court. And there he was made to swear upon the\r\nFour Evangelists, to tell the truth of his quest from the one to the\r\nother. Ah! Sir Pellinore, said Queen Guenever, ye were greatly to blame\r\nthat ye saved not this lady\xe2\x80\x99s life. Madam, said Pellinore, ye were\r\ngreatly to blame an ye would not save your own life an ye might, but,\r\nsave your pleasure, I was so furious in my quest that I would not\r\nabide, and that repenteth me, and shall the days of my life. Truly,\r\nsaid Merlin, ye ought sore to repent it, for that lady was your own\r\ndaughter begotten on the lady of the Rule, and that knight that was\r\ndead was her love, and should have wedded her, and he was a right good\r\nknight of a young man, and would have proved a good man, and to this\r\ncourt was he coming, and his name was Sir Miles of the Launds, and a\r\nknight came behind him and slew him with a spear, and his name is\r\nLoraine le Savage, a false knight and a coward; and she for great\r\nsorrow and dole slew herself with his sword, and her name was Eleine.\r\nAnd because ye would not abide and help her, ye shall see your best\r\nfriend fail you when ye be in the greatest distress that ever ye were\r\nor shall be. And that penance God hath ordained you for that deed, that\r\nhe that ye shall most trust to of any man alive, he shall leave you\r\nthere ye shall be slain. Me forthinketh, said King Pellinore, that this\r\nshall me betide, but God may fordo well destiny.\r\n\r\nThus, when the quest was done of the white hart, the which followed Sir\r\nGawaine; and the quest of the brachet, followed of Sir Tor, Pellinore\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson; and the quest of the lady that the knight took away, the which\r\nKing Pellinore at that time followed; then the king stablished all his\r\nknights, and them that were of lands not rich he gave them lands, and\r\ncharged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always to flee\r\ntreason; also, by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that\r\nasketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship of\r\nKing Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels, and\r\ngentlewomen succour, upon pain of death. Also, that no man take no\r\nbattles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, nor for no world\xe2\x80\x99s goods.\r\nUnto this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and\r\nyoung. And every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost.\r\n\r\nExplicit the Wedding of King Arthur. Sequitur quartus liber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How Merlin was assotted and doted on one of the ladies of\r\nthe lake, and how he was shut in a rock under a stone and there died.\r\n\r\nSo after these quests of Sir Gawaine, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore, it\r\nfell so that Merlin fell in a dotage on the damosel that King Pellinore\r\nbrought to court, and she was one of the damosels of the lake, that\r\nhight Nimue. But Merlin would let her have no rest, but always he would\r\nbe with her. And ever she made Merlin good cheer till she had learned\r\nof him all manner thing that she desired; and he was assotted upon her,\r\nthat he might not be from her. So on a time he told King Arthur that he\r\nshould not dure long, but for all his crafts he should be put in the\r\nearth quick. And so he told the king many things that should befall,\r\nbut always he warned the king to keep well his sword and the scabbard,\r\nfor he told him how the sword and the scabbard should be stolen by a\r\nwoman from him that he most trusted. Also he told King Arthur that he\r\nshould miss him,\xe2\x80\x94Yet had ye liefer than all your lands to have me\r\nagain. Ah, said the king, since ye know of your adventure, purvey for\r\nit, and put away by your crafts that misadventure. Nay, said Merlin, it\r\nwill not be; so he departed from the king. And within a while the\r\nDamosel of the Lake departed, and Merlin went with her evermore\r\nwheresomever she went. And ofttimes Merlin would have had her privily\r\naway by his subtle crafts; then she made him to swear that he should\r\nnever do none enchantment upon her if he would have his will. And so he\r\nsware; so she and Merlin went over the sea unto the land of Benwick,\r\nwhereas King Ban was king that had great war against King Claudas, and\r\nthere Merlin spake with King Ban\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a fair lady and a good, and\r\nher name was Elaine, and there he saw young Launcelot. There the queen\r\nmade great sorrow for the mortal war that King Claudas made on her lord\r\nand on her lands. Take none heaviness, said Merlin, for this same child\r\nwithin this twenty year shall revenge you on King Claudas, that all\r\nChristendom shall speak of it; and this same child shall be the most\r\nman of worship of the world, and his first name is Galahad, that know I\r\nwell, said Merlin, and since ye have confirmed him Launcelot. That is\r\ntruth, said the queen, his first name was Galahad. O Merlin, said the\r\nqueen, shall I live to see my son such a man of prowess? Yea, lady, on\r\nmy peril ye shall see it, and live many winters after.\r\n\r\nAnd so, soon after, the lady and Merlin departed, and by the way Merlin\r\nshowed her many wonders, and came into Cornwall. And always Merlin lay\r\nabout the lady to have her maidenhood, and she was ever passing weary\r\nof him, and fain would have been delivered of him, for she was afeard\r\nof him because he was a devil\xe2\x80\x99s son, and she could not beskift him by\r\nno mean. And so on a time it happed that Merlin showed to her in a rock\r\nwhereas was a great wonder, and wrought by enchantment, that went under\r\na great stone. So by her subtle working she made Merlin to go under\r\nthat stone to let her wit of the marvels there; but she wrought so\r\nthere for him that he came never out for all the craft he could do. And\r\nso she departed and left Merlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How five kings came into this land to war against King\r\nArthur, and what counsel Arthur had against them.\r\n\r\nAnd as King Arthur rode to Camelot, and held there a great feast with\r\nmirth and joy, so soon after he returned unto Cardoile, and there came\r\nunto Arthur new tidings that the king of Denmark, and the king of\r\nIreland that was his brother, and the king of the Vale, and the king of\r\nSoleise, and the king of the Isle of Longtains, all these five kings\r\nwith a great host were entered into the land of King Arthur, and burnt\r\nand slew clean afore them, both cities and castles, that it was pity to\r\nhear. Alas, said Arthur, yet had I never rest one month since I was\r\ncrowned king of this land. Now shall I never rest till I meet with\r\nthose kings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege\r\npeople shall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will, and\r\nabide who that will. Then the king let write unto King Pellinore, and\r\nprayed him in all haste to make him ready with such people as he might\r\nlightliest rear and hie him after in all haste. All the barons were\r\nprivily wroth that the king would depart so suddenly; but the king by\r\nno mean would abide, but made writing unto them that were not there,\r\nand bade them hie after him, such as were not at that time in the\r\ncourt. Then the king came to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you\r\nready, for ye shall go with me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall\r\ncause me to be the more hardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not\r\nwit my lady to be in no jeopardy. Sir, said she, I am at your\r\ncommandment, and shall be ready what time so ye be ready. So on the\r\nmorn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as they had,\r\nand came into the north, into a forest beside Humber, and there lodged\r\nthem. When the word and tiding came unto the five kings above said,\r\nthat Arthur was beside Humber in a forest, there was a knight, brother\r\nunto one of the five kings, that gave them this counsel: Ye know well\r\nthat Sir Arthur hath the flower of chivalry of the world with him, as\r\nit is proved by the great battle he did with the eleven kings; and\r\ntherefore hie unto him night and day till that we be nigh him, for the\r\nlonger he tarrieth the bigger he is, and we ever the weaker; and he is\r\nso courageous of himself that he is come to the field with little\r\npeople, and therefore let us set upon him or day and we shall slay\r\ndown; of his knights there shall none escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and\r\nslew the five kings and made the remnant to flee.\r\n\r\nUnto this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth\r\nwith their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and\r\nset upon his host as the king and his knights were in their pavilions.\r\nKing Arthur was unarmed, and had laid him to rest with his Queen\r\nGuenever. Sir, said Sir Kay, it is not good we be unarmed. We shall\r\nhave no need, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Griflet, that lay in a little\r\npavilion by the king. With that they heard a great noise, and many\r\ncried, Treason, treason! Alas, said King Arthur, we be betrayed! Unto\r\narms, fellows, then he cried. So they were armed anon at all points.\r\nThen came there a wounded knight unto the king, and said, Sir, save\r\nyourself and my lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much\r\npeople of ours slain. So anon the king and the queen and the three\r\nknights took their horses, and rode toward Humber to pass over it, and\r\nthe water was so rough that they were afraid to pass over. Now may ye\r\nchoose, said King Arthur, whether ye will abide and take the adventure\r\non this side, for an ye be taken they will slay you. It were me liefer,\r\nsaid the queen, to die in the water than to fall in your enemies\xe2\x80\x99 hands\r\nand there be slain.\r\n\r\nAnd as they stood so talking, Sir Kay saw the five kings coming on\r\nhorseback by themselves alone, with their spears in their hands even\r\ntoward them. Lo, said Sir Kay, yonder be the five kings; let us go to\r\nthem and match them. That were folly, said Sir Gawaine, for we are but\r\nthree and they be five. That is truth, said Sir Griflet. No force, said\r\nSir Kay, I will undertake for two of them, and then may ye three\r\nundertake for the other three. And therewithal, Sir Kay let his horse\r\nrun as fast as he might, and struck one of them through the shield and\r\nthe body a fathom, that the king fell to the earth stark dead. That saw\r\nSir Gawaine, and ran unto another king so hard that he smote him\r\nthrough the body. And therewithal King Arthur ran to another, and smote\r\nhim through the body with a spear, that he fell to the earth dead. Then\r\nSir Griflet ran unto the fourth king, and gave him such a fall that his\r\nneck brake. Anon Sir Kay ran unto the fifth king, and smote him so hard\r\non the helm that the stroke clave the helm and the head to the earth.\r\nThat was well stricken, said King Arthur, and worshipfully hast thou\r\nholden thy promise, therefore I shall honour thee while that I live.\r\nAnd therewithal they set the queen in a barge into Humber; but always\r\nQueen Guenever praised Sir Kay for his deeds, and said, What lady that\r\nye love, and she love you not again she were greatly to blame; and\r\namong ladies, said the queen, I shall bear your noble fame, for ye\r\nspake a great word, and fulfilled it worshipfully. And therewith the\r\nqueen departed.\r\n\r\nThen the king and the three knights rode into the forest, for there\r\nthey supposed to hear of them that were escaped; and there he found the\r\nmost part of his people, and told them all how the five kings were\r\ndead. And therefore let us hold us together till it be day, and when\r\ntheir host have espied that their chieftains be slain, they will make\r\nsuch dole that they shall no more help themselves. And right so as the\r\nking said, so it was; for when they found the five kings dead, they\r\nmade such dole that they fell from their horses. Therewithal came King\r\nArthur but with a few people, and slew on the left hand and on the\r\nright hand, that well-nigh there escaped no man, but all were slain to\r\nthe number thirty thousand. And when the battle was all ended, the king\r\nkneeled down and thanked God meekly. And then he sent for the queen,\r\nand soon she was come, and she made great joy of the overcoming of that\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How the battle was finished or he came, and how King Arthur\r\nfounded an abbey where the battle was.\r\n\r\nTherewithal came one to King Arthur, and told him that King Pellinore\r\nwas within three mile with a great host; and he said, Go unto him, and\r\nlet him understand how we have sped. So within a while King Pellinore\r\ncame with a great host, and saluted the people and the king, and there\r\nwas great joy made on every side. Then the king let search how much\r\npeople of his party there was slain; and there were found but little\r\npast two hundred men slain and eight knights of the Table Round in\r\ntheir pavilions. Then the king let rear and devise in the same place\r\nwhereat the battle was done a fair abbey, and endowed it with great\r\nlivelihood, and let it call the Abbey of La Beale Adventure. But when\r\nsome of them came into their countries, whereof the five kings were\r\nkings, and told them how they were slain, there was made great dole.\r\nAnd all King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, as the King of North Wales, and the\r\nkings of the North, [when they] wist of the battle, they were passing\r\nheavy. And so the king returned unto Camelot in haste.\r\n\r\nAnd when he was come to Camelot he called King Pellinore unto him, and\r\nsaid, Ye understand well that we have lost eight knights of the best of\r\nthe Table Round, and by your advice we will choose eight again of the\r\nbest we may find in this court. Sir, said Pellinore, I shall counsel\r\nyou after my conceit the best: there are in your court full noble\r\nknights both of old and young; and therefore by mine advice ye shall\r\nchoose half of the old and half of the young. Which be the old? said\r\nKing Arthur. Sir, said King Pellinore, meseemeth that King Uriens that\r\nhath wedded your sister Morgan le Fay, and the King of the Lake, and\r\nSir Hervise de Revel, a noble knight, and Sir Galagars, the fourth.\r\nThis is well devised, said King Arthur, and right so shall it be. Now,\r\nwhich are the four young knights? said Arthur. Sir, said Pellinore, the\r\nfirst is Sir Gawaine, your nephew, that is as good a knight of his time\r\nas any is in this land; and the second as meseemeth best is Sir Griflet\r\nle Fise de Dieu, that is a good knight and full desirous in arms, and\r\nwho may see him live he shall prove a good knight; and the third as\r\nmeseemeth is well to be one of the knights of the Round Table, Sir Kay\r\nthe Seneschal, for many times he hath done full worshipfully, and now\r\nat your last battle he did full honourably for to undertake to slay two\r\nkings. By my head, said Arthur, he is best worth to be a knight of the\r\nRound Table of any that ye have rehearsed, an he had done no more\r\nprowess in his life days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Tor was made knight of the Round Table, and how\r\nBagdemagus was displeased.\r\n\r\nNow, said King Pellinore, I shall put to you two knights, and ye shall\r\nchoose which is most worthy, that is Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Tor, my\r\nson. But because Sir Tor is my son I may not praise him, but else, an\r\nhe were not my son, I durst say that of his age there is not in this\r\nland a better knight than he is, nor of better conditions and loath to\r\ndo any wrong, and loath to take any wrong. By my head, said Arthur, he\r\nis a passing good knight as any ye spake of this day, that wot I well,\r\nsaid the king; for I have seen him proved, but he saith little and he\r\ndoth much more, for I know none in all this court an he were as well\r\nborn on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side as he is on your side, that is like him of\r\nprowess and of might: and therefore I will have him at this time, and\r\nleave Sir Bagdemagus till another time. So when they were so chosen by\r\nthe assent of all the barons, so were there found in their sieges every\r\nknights\xe2\x80\x99 names that here are rehearsed, and so were they set in their\r\nsieges; whereof Sir Bagdemagus was wonderly wroth, that Sir Tor was\r\nadvanced afore him, and therefore suddenly he departed from the court,\r\nand took his squire with him, and rode long in a forest till they came\r\nto a cross, and there alighted and said his prayers devoutly. The\r\nmeanwhile his squire found written upon the cross, that Bagdemagus\r\nshould never return unto the court again, till he had won a knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody of the Round Table, body for body. So, sir, said the squire, here\r\nI find writing of you, therefore I rede you return again to the court.\r\nThat shall I never, said Bagdemagus, till men speak of me great\r\nworship, and that I be worthy to be a knight of the Round Table. And so\r\nhe rode forth, and there by the way he found a branch of an holy herb\r\nthat was the sign of the Sangreal, and no knight found such tokens but\r\nhe were a good liver.\r\n\r\nSo, as Sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures, it happed him to\r\ncome to the rock whereas the Lady of the Lake had put Merlin under the\r\nstone, and there he heard him make great dole; whereof Sir Bagdemagus\r\nwould have holpen him, and went unto the great stone, and it was so\r\nheavy that an hundred men might not lift it up. When Merlin wist he was\r\nthere, he bade leave his labour, for all was in vain, for he might\r\nnever be holpen but by her that put him there. And so Bagdemagus\r\ndeparted and did many adventures, and proved after a full good knight,\r\nand came again to the court and was made knight of the Round Table. So\r\non the morn there fell new tidings and other adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul,\r\nchased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.\r\n\r\nThen it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode a-hunting into\r\na great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon\r\nof Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were well horsed, and so\r\nthey chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten mile\r\nfrom their fellowship. And at the last they chased so sore that they\r\nslew their horses underneath them. Then were they all three on foot,\r\nand ever they saw the hart afore them passing weary and enbushed. What\r\nwill we do? said King Arthur, we are hard bestead. Let us go on foot,\r\nsaid King Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging. Then were they\r\nware of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting\r\non his throat, and more other hounds came after. Then King Arthur blew\r\nthe prise and dight the hart.\r\n\r\nThen the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a great\r\nwater a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the water, and\r\nthe ship came right unto them and landed on the sands. Then Arthur went\r\nto the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly creature therein. Sirs,\r\nsaid the king, come thence, and let us see what is in this ship. So\r\nthey went in all three, and found it richly behanged with cloth of\r\nsilk. By then it was dark night, and there suddenly were about them an\r\nhundred torches set upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave\r\ngreat light; and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and\r\nsaluted King Arthur on their knees, and called him by his name, and\r\nsaid he was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have of\r\nthe best. The king thanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and\r\nhis two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly\r\nbeseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served of\r\nall wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had great\r\nmarvel, for he fared never better in his life as for one supper. And so\r\nwhen they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a\r\nchamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King\r\nUriens served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was\r\nled into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so they\r\nwere laid in their beds easily. And anon they fell asleep, and slept\r\nmarvellously sore all the night. And on the morrow King Uriens was in\r\nCamelot abed in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arms, Morgan le Fay. And when he awoke he\r\nhad great marvel, how he came there, for on the even afore he was two\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 journey from Camelot. And when King Arthur awoke he found himself\r\nin a dark prison, hearing about him many complaints of woful knights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How Arthur took upon him to fight to be delivered out of\r\nprison, and also for to deliver twenty knights that were in prison.\r\n\r\nWhat are ye that so complain? said King Arthur. We be here twenty\r\nknights, prisoners, said they, and some of us have lain here seven\r\nyear, and some more and some less. For what cause? said Arthur. We\r\nshall tell you, said the knights; this lord of this castle, his name is\r\nSir Damas, and he is the falsest knight that liveth, and full of\r\ntreason, and a very coward as any liveth, and he hath a younger\r\nbrother, a good knight of prowess, his name is Sir Ontzlake; and this\r\ntraitor Damas, the elder brother will give him no part of his\r\nlivelihood, but as Sir Ontzlake keepeth thorough prowess of his hands,\r\nand so he keepeth from him a full fair manor and a rich, and therein\r\nSir Ontzlake dwelleth worshipfully, and is well beloved of all people.\r\nAnd this Sir Damas, our master is as evil beloved, for he is without\r\nmercy, and he is a coward, and great war hath been betwixt them both,\r\nbut Ontzlake hath ever the better, and ever he proffereth Sir Damas to\r\nfight for the livelihood, body for body, but he will not do; other-else\r\nto find a knight to fight for him. Unto that Sir Damas had granted to\r\nfind a knight, but he is so evil beloved and hated, that there is never\r\na knight will fight for him. And when Damas saw this, that there was\r\nnever a knight would fight for him, he hath daily lain await with many\r\nknights with him, and taken all the knights in this country to see and\r\nespy their adventures, he hath taken them by force and brought them to\r\nhis prison. And so he took us separately as we rode on our adventures,\r\nand many good knights have died in this prison for hunger, to the\r\nnumber of eighteen knights; and if any of us all that here is, or hath\r\nbeen, would have foughten with his brother Ontzlake, he would have\r\ndelivered us, but for because this Damas is so false and so full of\r\ntreason we would never fight for him to die for it. And we be so lean\r\nfor hunger that unnethe we may stand on our feet. God deliver you, for\r\nhis mercy, said Arthur.\r\n\r\nAnon, therewithal there came a damosel unto Arthur, and asked him, What\r\ncheer? I cannot say, said he. Sir, said she, an ye will fight for my\r\nlord, ye shall be delivered out of prison, and else ye escape never the\r\nlife. Now, said Arthur, that is hard, yet had I liefer to fight with a\r\nknight than to die in prison; with this, said Arthur, I may be\r\ndelivered and all these prisoners, I will do the battle. Yes, said the\r\ndamosel. I am ready, said Arthur, an I had horse and armour. Ye shall\r\nlack none, said the damosel. Meseemeth, damosel, I should have seen you\r\nin the court of Arthur. Nay said the damosel, I came never there, I am\r\nthe lord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter of this castle. Yet was she false, for she was one\r\nof the damosels of Morgan le Fay.\r\n\r\nAnon she went unto Sir Damas, and told him how he would do battle for\r\nhim, and so he sent for Arthur. And when he came he was well coloured,\r\nand well made of his limbs, that all knights that saw him said it were\r\npity that such a knight should die in prison. So Sir Damas and he were\r\nagreed that he should fight for him upon this covenant, that all other\r\nknights should be delivered; and unto that was Sir Damas sworn unto\r\nArthur, and also to do the battle to the uttermost. And with that all\r\nthe twenty knights were brought out of the dark prison into the hall,\r\nand delivered, and so they all abode to see the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How Accolon found himself by a well, and he took upon him\r\nto do battle against Arthur.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he awoke he found himself\r\nby a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of death. And\r\nthere came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out of that pipe\r\nran water all on high in a stone of marble. When Sir Accolon saw this,\r\nhe blessed him and said, Jesus save my lord King Arthur, and King\r\nUriens, for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were\r\ndevils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall\r\ndestroy all where I may find these false damosels that use\r\nenchantments. Right with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and\r\na flat nose, and saluted Sir Accolon, and said how he came from Queen\r\nMorgan le Fay, and she greeteth you well, and biddeth you be of strong\r\nheart, for ye shall fight to morrow with a knight at the hour of prime,\r\nand therefore she hath sent you here Excalibur, Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sword, and the\r\nscabbard, and she biddeth you as ye love her, that ye do the battle to\r\nthe uttermost, without any mercy, like as ye had promised her when ye\r\nspake together in privity; and what damosel that bringeth her the\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s head, which ye shall fight withal, she will make her a queen.\r\nNow I understand you well, said Accolon, I shall hold that I have\r\npromised her now I have the sword: when saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le\r\nFay? Right late, said the dwarf. Then Accolon took him in his arms and\r\nsaid, Recommend me unto my lady queen, and tell her all shall be done\r\nthat I have promised her, and else I will die for it. Now I suppose,\r\nsaid Accolon, she hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this\r\nbattle. Ye may well believe it, said the dwarf. Right so there came a\r\nknight and a lady with six squires, and saluted Accolon, and prayed him\r\nfor to arise, and come and rest him at his manor. And so Accolon\r\nmounted upon a void horse, and went with the knight unto a fair manor\r\nby a priory, and there he had passing good cheer.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade make him\r\nready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight\r\nwith a good knight, for he had found a good knight that was ready to do\r\nbattle at all points. When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he was\r\npassing heavy, for he was wounded a little to-fore through both his\r\nthighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as he was wounded, he\r\nwould have taken the battle on hand. So it happed at that time, by the\r\nmeans of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when\r\nhe heard of that battle, and how Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he\r\nwould fight for him. Because Morgan le Fay had sent him Excalibur and\r\nthe sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn: this was the cause\r\nSir Accolon took the battle on hand. Then Sir Ontzlake was passing\r\nglad, and thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart that he would do so\r\nmuch for him. And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his brother\r\nSir Damas, that he had a knight that for him should be ready in the\r\nfield by the hour of prime.\r\n\r\nSo on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir\r\nDamas, When shall we to the field? Sir, said Sir Damas, ye shall hear\r\nmass. And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done there came a\r\nsquire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready,\r\nfor our knight is ready in the field. Then Sir Arthur mounted upon\r\nhorseback, and there were all the knights and commons of that country;\r\nand so by all advices there were chosen twelve good men of the country\r\nfor to wait upon the two knights. And right as Arthur was on horseback\r\nthere came a damosel from Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a\r\nsword like unto Excalibur, and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur,\r\nMorgan le Fay sendeth here your sword for great love. And he thanked\r\nher, and weened it had been so, but she was false, for the sword and\r\nthe scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.\r\n\r\nAnd then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let their\r\nhorses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield\r\nwith their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to the earth; and\r\nthen they started up both, and pulled out their swords. The meanwhile\r\nthat they were thus at the battle, came the Damosel of the Lake into\r\nthe field, that put Merlin under the stone; and she came thither for\r\nlove of King Arthur, for she knew how Morgan le Fay had so ordained\r\nthat King Arthur should have been slain that day, and therefore she\r\ncame to save his life. And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave\r\nmany great strokes, but always Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sword bit not like Accolon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword; but for the most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded\r\nsore Arthur, that it was marvel he stood, and always his blood fell\r\nfrom him fast.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed, and then\r\nhe deemed treason that his sword was changed; for his sword bit not\r\nsteel as it was wont to do, therefore he dreaded him sore to be dead,\r\nfor ever him seemed that the sword in Accolon\xe2\x80\x99s hand was Excalibur, for\r\nat every stroke that Accolon struck he drew blood on Arthur. Now,\r\nknight, said Accolon unto Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur\r\nanswered not again, and gave him such a buffet on the helm that it made\r\nhim to stoop, nigh falling down to the earth. Then Sir Accolon withdrew\r\nhim a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir Arthur\r\nsuch a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth. Then were they wroth\r\nboth, and gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir Arthur lost\r\nso much blood that it was marvel he stood on his feet, but he was so\r\nfull of knighthood that knightly he endured the pain. And Sir Accolon\r\nlost not a deal of blood, therefore he waxed passing light, and Sir\r\nArthur was passing feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for all\r\nthat he made countenance as though he might endure, and held Accolon as\r\nshort as he might. But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that he\r\nwaxed passing hardy. But all men that beheld him said they saw never\r\nknight fight so well as Arthur did considering the blood that he bled.\r\nSo was all the people sorry for him, but the two brethren would not\r\naccord. Then always they fought together as fierce knights, and Sir\r\nArthur withdrew him a little for to rest him, and Sir Accolon called\r\nhim to battle and said, It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest.\r\nAnd therewith he came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth\r\nfor the blood that he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the\r\nhelm, so mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and\r\ntherewith Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass\r\namong the blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his\r\nhands. When Sir Arthur saw that, he was in great fear to die, but\r\nalways he held up his shield and lost no ground, nor bated no cheer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sword that he fought with brake, and how\r\nhe recovered of Accolon his own sword Excalibur, and overcame his\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Accolon began with words of treason, and said, Knight, thou\r\nart overcome, and mayst not endure, and also thou art weaponless, and\r\nthou hast lost much of thy blood, and I am full loath to slay thee,\r\ntherefore yield thee to me as recreant. Nay, said Sir Arthur, I may not\r\nso, for I have promised to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith\r\nof my body, while me lasteth the life, and therefore I had liefer to\r\ndie with honour than to live with shame; and if it were possible for me\r\nto die an hundred times, I had liefer to die so oft than yield me to\r\nthee; for though I lack weapon, I shall lack no worship, and if thou\r\nslay me weaponless that shall be thy shame. Well, said Accolon, as for\r\nthe shame I will not spare, now keep thee from me, for thou art but a\r\ndead man. And therewith Accolon gave him such a stroke that he fell\r\nnigh to the earth, and would have had Arthur to have cried him mercy.\r\nBut Sir Arthur pressed unto Accolon with his shield, and gave him with\r\nthe pommel in his hand such a buffet that he went three strides aback.\r\n\r\nWhen the Damosel of the Lake beheld Arthur, how full of prowess his\r\nbody was, and the false treason that was wrought for him to have had\r\nhim slain, she had great pity that so good a knight and such a man of\r\nworship should so be destroyed. And at the next stroke Sir Accolon\r\nstruck him such a stroke that by the damosel\xe2\x80\x99s enchantment the sword\r\nExcalibur fell out of Accolon\xe2\x80\x99s hand to the earth. And therewithal Sir\r\nArthur lightly leapt to it, and gat it in his hand, and forthwithal he\r\nknew that it was his sword Excalibur, and said, Thou hast been from me\r\nall too long, and much damage hast thou done me; and therewith he\r\nespied the scabbard hanging by his side, and suddenly he sterte to him\r\nand pulled the scabbard from him, and threw it from him as far as he\r\nmight throw it. O knight, said Arthur, this day hast thou done me great\r\ndamage with this sword; now are ye come unto your death, for I shall\r\nnot warrant you but ye shall as well be rewarded with this sword, or\r\never we depart, as thou hast rewarded me; for much pain have ye made me\r\nto endure, and much blood have I lost. And therewith Sir Arthur rushed\r\non him with all his might and pulled him to the earth, and then rushed\r\noff his helm, and gave him such a buffet on the head that the blood\r\ncame out at his ears, his nose, and his mouth. Now will I slay thee,\r\nsaid Arthur. Slay me ye may well, said Accolon, an it please you, for\r\nye are the best knight that ever I found, and I see well that God is\r\nwith you. But for I promised to do this battle, said Accolon, to the\r\nuttermost, and never to be recreant while I lived, therefore shall I\r\nnever yield me with my mouth, but God do with my body what he will.\r\nThen Sir Arthur remembered him, and thought he should have seen this\r\nknight. Now tell me, said Arthur, or I will slay thee, of what country\r\nart thou, and of what court? Sir Knight, said Sir Accolon, I am of the\r\ncourt of King Arthur, and my name is Accolon of Gaul. Then was Arthur\r\nmore dismayed than he was beforehand; for then he remembered him of his\r\nsister Morgan le Fay, and of the enchantment of the ship. O sir knight,\r\nsaid he, I pray you tell me who gave you this sword, and by whom ye had\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How Accolon confessed the treason of Morgan le Fay, King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and how she would have done slay him.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Accolon bethought him, and said, Woe worth this sword, for by\r\nit have I got my death. It may well be, said the king. Now, sir, said\r\nAccolon, I will tell you; this sword hath been in my keeping the most\r\npart of this twelvemonth; and Morgan le Fay, King Uriens\xe2\x80\x99 wife, sent it\r\nme yesterday by a dwarf, to this intent, that I should slay King\r\nArthur, her brother. For ye shall understand King Arthur is the man in\r\nthe world that she most hateth, because he is most of worship and of\r\nprowess of any of her blood; also she loveth me out of measure as\r\nparamour, and I her again; and if she might bring about to slay Arthur\r\nby her crafts, she would slay her husband King Uriens lightly, and then\r\nhad she me devised to be king in this land, and so to reign, and she to\r\nbe my queen; but that is now done, said Accolon, for I am sure of my\r\ndeath. Well, said Sir Arthur, I feel by you ye would have been king in\r\nthis land. It had been great damage to have destroyed your lord, said\r\nArthur. It is truth, said Accolon, but now I have told you truth,\r\nwherefore I pray you tell me of whence ye are, and of what court? O\r\nAccolon, said King Arthur, now I let thee wit that I am King Arthur, to\r\nwhom thou hast done great damage. When Accolon heard that he cried\r\naloud, Fair, sweet lord, have mercy on me, for I knew not you. O Sir\r\nAccolon, said King Arthur, mercy shalt thou have, because I feel by thy\r\nwords at this time thou knewest not my person; but I understand well by\r\nthy words that thou hast agreed to the death of my person, and\r\ntherefore thou art a traitor; but I wite thee the less, for my sister\r\nMorgan le Fay by her false crafts made thee to agree and consent to her\r\nfalse lusts, but I shall be sore avenged upon her an I live, that all\r\nChristendom shall speak of it; God knoweth I have honoured her and\r\nworshipped her more than all my kin, and more have I trusted her than\r\nmine own wife and all my kin after.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Arthur called the keepers of the field, and said, Sirs, come\r\nhither, for here are we two knights that have fought unto a great\r\ndamage unto us both, and like each one of us to have slain other, if it\r\nhad happed so; and had any of us known other, here had been no battle,\r\nnor stroke stricken. Then all aloud cried Accolon unto all the knights\r\nand men that were then there gathered together, and said to them in\r\nthis manner, O lords, this noble knight that I have fought withal, the\r\nwhich me sore repenteth, is the most man of prowess, of manhood, and of\r\nworship in the world, for it is himself King Arthur, our alther liege\r\nlord, and with mishap and with misadventure have I done this battle\r\nwith the king and lord that I am holden withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the\r\ntwenty knights, and how Sir Accolon died.\r\n\r\nThen all the people fell down on their knees and cried King Arthur\r\nmercy. Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see what\r\nadventures befall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have fought\r\nwith a knight of mine own unto my great damage and his both. But, sirs,\r\nbecause I am sore hurt, and he both, and I had great need of a little\r\nrest, ye shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren: As to\r\nthee, Sir Damas, for whom I have been champion and won the field of\r\nthis knight, yet will I judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called an\r\norgulous knight, and full of villainy, and not worth of prowess your\r\ndeeds, therefore I will that ye give unto your brother all the whole\r\nmanor with the appurtenance, under this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold\r\nthe manor of you, and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon, for\r\nthat will become you better to ride on than upon a courser. Also I\r\ncharge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never distress no\r\nknights errant that ride on their adventure. And also that thou restore\r\nthese twenty knights that thou hast long kept prisoners, of all their\r\nharness, that they be content for; and if any of them come to my court\r\nand complain of thee, by my head thou shalt die therefore. Also, Sir\r\nOntzlake, as to you, because ye are named a good knight, and full of\r\nprowess, and true and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be your\r\ncharge I will give you, that in all goodly haste ye come unto me and my\r\ncourt, and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be\r\nthereafter I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in\r\nshort time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother Sir\r\nDamas. God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty, I\r\nshall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment; for, sir,\r\nsaid Sir Ontzlake, as God would, as I was hurt but late with an\r\nadventurous knight through both my thighs, that grieved me sore, and\r\nelse had I done this battle with you. God would, said Arthur, it had\r\nbeen so, for then had not I been hurt as I am. I shall tell you the\r\ncause why: for I had not been hurt as I am, had it not been mine own\r\nsword, that was stolen from me by treason; and this battle was ordained\r\naforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to the purpose by\r\nfalse treason, and by false enchantment. Alas, said Sir Ontzlake, that\r\nis great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are of your deeds and\r\nprowess, that any man or woman might find in their hearts to work any\r\ntreason against you. I shall reward them, said Arthur, in short time,\r\nby the grace of God. Now, tell me, said Arthur, how far am I from\r\nCamelot? Sir, ye are two days\xe2\x80\x99 journey therefrom. I would fain be at\r\nsome place of worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me. Sir, said\r\nSir Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders\xe2\x80\x99 foundation, of\r\nnuns, but three miles hence. So the king took his leave of all the\r\npeople, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. And when\r\nthey were come to the abbey, he let fetch leeches and search his wounds\r\nand Accolon\xe2\x80\x99s both; but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he had\r\nbled so much blood that he might not live, but King Arthur was well\r\nrecovered. So when Accolon was dead he let send him on an horse-bier\r\nwith six knights unto Camelot, and said: Bear him to my sister Morgan\r\nle Fay, and say that I send her him to a present, and tell her I have\r\nmy sword Excalibur and the scabbard; so they departed with the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How Morgan would have slain Sir Uriens her husband, and\r\nhow Sir Uwaine her son saved him.\r\n\r\nThe meanwhile Morgan le Fay had weened King Arthur had been dead. So on\r\na day she espied King Uriens lay in his bed sleeping. Then she called\r\nunto her a maiden of her counsel, and said, Go fetch me my lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsword, for I saw never better time to slay him than now. O madam, said\r\nthe damosel, an ye slay my lord ye can never escape. Care not you, said\r\nMorgan le Fay, for now I see my time in the which it is best to do it,\r\nand therefore hie thee fast and fetch me the sword. Then the damosel\r\ndeparted, and found Sir Uwaine sleeping upon a bed in another chamber,\r\nso she went unto Sir Uwaine, and awaked him, and bade him, Arise, and\r\nwait on my lady your mother, for she will slay the king your father\r\nsleeping in his bed, for I go to fetch his sword. Well, said Sir\r\nUwaine, go on your way, and let me deal. Anon the damosel brought\r\nMorgan the sword with quaking hands, and she lightly took the sword,\r\nand pulled it out, and went boldly unto the bed\xe2\x80\x99s side, and awaited how\r\nand where she might slay him best. And as she lifted up the sword to\r\nsmite, Sir Uwaine leapt unto his mother, and caught her by the hand,\r\nand said, Ah, fiend, what wilt thou do? An thou wert not my mother,\r\nwith this sword I should smite off thy head. Ah, said Sir Uwaine, men\r\nsaith that Merlin was begotten of a devil, but I may say an earthly\r\ndevil bare me. O fair son, Uwaine, have mercy upon me, I was tempted\r\nwith a devil, wherefore I cry thee mercy; I will never more do so; and\r\nsave my worship and discover me not. On this covenant, said Sir Uwaine,\r\nI will forgive it you, so ye will never be about to do such deeds. Nay,\r\nson, said she, and that I make you assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How Queen Morgan le Fay made great sorrow for the death of\r\nAccolon, and how she stole away the scabbard from Arthur.\r\n\r\nThen came tidings unto Morgan le Fay that Accolon was dead, and his\r\nbody brought unto the church, and how King Arthur had his sword again.\r\nBut when Queen Morgan wist that Accolon was dead, she was so sorrowful\r\nthat near her heart to-brast. But because she would not it were known,\r\noutward she kept her countenance, and made no semblant of sorrow. But\r\nwell she wist an she abode till her brother Arthur came thither, there\r\nshould no gold go for her life.\r\n\r\nThen she went unto Queen Guenever, and asked her leave to ride into the\r\ncountry. Ye may abide, said Queen Guenever, till your brother the king\r\ncome home. I may not, said Morgan le Fay, for I have such hasty\r\ntidings, that I may not tarry. Well, said Guenever, ye may depart when\r\nye will. So early on the morn, or it was day, she took her horse and\r\nrode all that day and most part of the night, and on the morn by noon\r\nshe came to the same abbey of nuns whereas lay King Arthur; and she\r\nknowing he was there, she asked where he was. And they answered how he\r\nhad laid him in his bed to sleep, for he had had but little rest these\r\nthree nights. Well, said she, I charge you that none of you awake him\r\ntill I do, and then she alighted off her horse, and thought for to\r\nsteal away Excalibur his sword, and so she went straight unto his\r\nchamber, and no man durst disobey her commandment, and there she found\r\nArthur asleep in his bed, and Excalibur in his right hand naked. When\r\nshe saw that she was passing heavy that she might not come by the sword\r\nwithout she had awaked him, and then she wist well she had been dead.\r\nThen she took the scabbard and went her way on horseback. When the king\r\nawoke and missed his scabbard, he was wroth, and he asked who had been\r\nthere, and they said his sister, Queen Morgan had been there, and had\r\nput the scabbard under her mantle and was gone. Alas, said Arthur,\r\nfalsely ye have watched me. Sir, said they all, we durst not disobey\r\nyour sister\xe2\x80\x99s commandment. Ah, said the king, let fetch the best horse\r\nmay be found, and bid Sir Ontzlake arm him in all haste, and take\r\nanother good horse and ride with me. So anon the king and Ontzlake were\r\nwell armed, and rode after this lady, and so they came by a cross and\r\nfound a cowherd, and they asked the poor man if there came any lady\r\nriding that way. Sir, said this poor man, right late came a lady riding\r\nwith a forty horses, and to yonder forest she rode. Then they spurred\r\ntheir horses, and followed fast, and within a while Arthur had a sight\r\nof Morgan le Fay; then he chased as fast as he might. When she espied\r\nhim following her, she rode a greater pace through the forest till she\r\ncame to a plain, and when she saw she might not escape, she rode unto a\r\nlake thereby, and said, Whatsoever come of me, my brother shall not\r\nhave this scabbard. And then she let throw the scabbard in the deepest\r\nof the water so it sank, for it was heavy of gold and precious stones.\r\n\r\nThen she rode into a valley where many great stones were, and when she\r\nsaw she must be overtaken, she shaped herself, horse and man, by\r\nenchantment unto a great marble stone. Anon withal came Sir Arthur and\r\nSir Ontzlake whereas the king might know his sister and her men, and\r\none knight from another. Ah, said the king, here may ye see the\r\nvengeance of God, and now am I sorry that this misadventure is\r\nbefallen. And then he looked for the scabbard, but it would not be\r\nfound, so he returned to the abbey where he came from. So when Arthur\r\nwas gone she turned all into the likeliness as she and they were\r\nbefore, and said, Sirs, now may we go where we will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been\r\ndrowned, and how King Arthur returned home again.\r\n\r\nThen said Morgan, Saw ye Arthur, my brother? Yea, said her knights,\r\nright well, and that ye should have found an we might have stirred from\r\none stead, for by his armyvestal countenance he would have caused us to\r\nhave fled. I believe you, said Morgan. Anon after as she rode she met a\r\nknight leading another knight on his horse before him, bound hand and\r\nfoot, blindfold, to have drowned him in a fountain. When she saw this\r\nknight so bound, she asked him, What will ye do with that knight? Lady,\r\nsaid he, I will drown him. For what cause? she asked. For I found him\r\nwith my wife, and she shall have the same death anon. That were pity,\r\nsaid Morgan le Fay. Now, what say ye, knight, is it truth that he saith\r\nof you? she said to the knight that should be drowned. Nay truly,\r\nmadam, he saith not right on me. Of whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay,\r\nand of what country? I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is\r\nManassen, cousin unto Accolon of Gaul. Ye say well, said she, and for\r\nthe love of him ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary\r\nin the same case ye be in. So Manassen was loosed and the other knight\r\nbound. And anon Manassen unarmed him, and armed himself in his harness,\r\nand so mounted on horseback, and the knight afore him, and so threw him\r\ninto the fountain and drowned him. And then he rode unto Morgan again,\r\nand asked if she would anything unto King Arthur. Tell him that I\r\nrescued thee, not for the love of him but for the love of Accolon, and\r\ntell him I fear him not while I can make me and them that be with me in\r\nlikeness of stones; and let him wit I can do much more when I see my\r\ntime. And so she departed into the country of Gore, and there was she\r\nrichly received, and made her castles and towns passing strong, for\r\nalways she dreaded much King Arthur.\r\n\r\nWhen the king had well rested him at the abbey, he rode unto Camelot,\r\nand found his queen and his barons right glad of his coming. And when\r\nthey heard of his strange adventures as is afore rehearsed, then all\r\nhad marvel of the falsehood of Morgan le Fay; many knights wished her\r\nburnt. Then came Manassen to court and told the king of his adventure.\r\nWell, said the king, she is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged on her\r\nan I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it. So on the morn there\r\ncame a damosel from Morgan to the king, and she brought with her the\r\nrichest mantle that ever was seen in that court, for it was set as full\r\nof precious stones as one might stand by another, and there were the\r\nrichest stones that ever the king saw. And the damosel said, Your\r\nsister sendeth you this mantle, and desireth that ye should take this\r\ngift of her; and in what thing she hath offended you, she will amend it\r\nat your own pleasure. When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him\r\nmuch, but he said but little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How the Damosel of the Lake saved King Arthur from mantle\r\nthat should have burnt him.\r\n\r\nWith that came the Damosel of the Lake unto the king, and said, Sir, I\r\nmust speak with you in privity. Say on, said the king, what ye will.\r\nSir, said the damosel, put not on you this mantle till ye have seen\r\nmore, and in no wise let it not come on you, nor on no knight of yours,\r\ntill ye command the bringer thereof to put it upon her. Well, said King\r\nArthur, it shall be done as ye counsel me. And then he said unto the\r\ndamosel that came from his sister, Damosel, this mantle that ye have\r\nbrought me, I will see it upon you. Sir, she said, It will not beseem\r\nme to wear a king\xe2\x80\x99s garment. By my head, said Arthur, ye shall wear it\r\nor it come on my back, or any man\xe2\x80\x99s that here is. And so the king made\r\nit to be put upon her, and forth withal she fell down dead, and never\r\nmore spake word after and burnt to coals. Then was the king wonderly\r\nwroth, more than he was to-forehand, and said unto King Uriens, My\r\nsister, your wife, is alway about to betray me, and well I wot either\r\nye, or my nephew, your son, is of counsel with her to have me\r\ndestroyed; but as for you, said the king to King Uriens, I deem not\r\ngreatly that ye be of her counsel, for Accolon confessed to me by his\r\nown mouth, that she would have destroyed you as well as me, therefore I\r\nhold you excused; but as for your son, Sir Uwaine, I hold him suspect,\r\ntherefore I charge you put him out of my court. So Sir Uwaine was\r\ndischarged. And when Sir Gawaine wist that, he made him ready to go\r\nwith him; and said, Whoso banisheth my cousin-germain shall banish me.\r\nSo they two departed, and rode into a great forest, and so they came to\r\nan abbey of monks, and there were well lodged. But when the king wist\r\nthat Sir Gawaine was departed from the court, there was made great\r\nsorrow among all the estates. Now, said Gaheris, Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s brother, we\r\nhave lost two good knights for the love of one. So on the morn they\r\nheard their masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till that they\r\ncame to a great forest. Then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a\r\nturret [of] twelve fair damosels, and two knights armed on great\r\nhorses, and the damosels went to and fro by a tree. And then was Sir\r\nGawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as\r\nthe damosels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon the\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine met with twelve fair\r\ndamosels, and how they complained on Sir Marhaus.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked why\r\nthey did that despite to the shield. Sir, said the damosels, we shall\r\ntell you. There is a knight in this country that owneth this white\r\nshield, and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all\r\nladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the\r\nshield. I shall say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good\r\nknight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though\r\nhe hate you he hath some certain cause, and peradventure he loveth in\r\nsome other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, an he\r\nbe such a man of prowess as ye speak of. Now, what is his name? Sir,\r\nsaid they, his name is Marhaus, the king\xe2\x80\x99s son of Ireland. I know him\r\nwell, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is alive, for\r\nI saw him once proved at a jousts where many knights were gathered, and\r\nthat time there might no man withstand him. Ah! said Sir Gawaine,\r\ndamosels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose, he that\r\nhung that shield there, he will not be long therefrom, and then may\r\nthose knights match him on horseback, and that is more your worship\r\nthan thus; for I will abide no longer to see a knight\xe2\x80\x99s shield\r\ndishonoured. And therewith Sir Uwaine and Gawaine departed a little\r\nfrom them, and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a\r\ngreat horse straight toward them. And when the twelve damosels saw Sir\r\nMarhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild, so that some of\r\nthem fell by the way. Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed\r\nhis shield, and said on high, Sir Marhaus, defend thee. And so they ran\r\ntogether that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Marhaus smote\r\nhim so hard that he brake his neck and the horse\xe2\x80\x99s back. That saw the\r\nother knight of the turret, and dressed him toward Marhaus, and they\r\nmet so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten\r\ndown, horse and man, stark dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine,\r\nand overthrew them both.\r\n\r\nAnd then Sir Marhaus rode unto his shield, and saw how it was defouled,\r\nand said, Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her love that\r\ngave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine where thou\r\nwast; and so he hanged it about his neck. Then he rode straight unto\r\nSir Gawaine and to Sir Uwaine, and asked them what they did there? They\r\nanswered him that they came from King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court to see adventures.\r\nWell, said Sir Marhaus, here am I ready, an adventurous knight that\r\nwill fulfil any adventure that ye will desire; and so departed from\r\nthem, to fetch his range. Let him go, said Sir Uwaine unto Sir Gawaine,\r\nfor he is a passing good knight as any is living; I would not by my\r\nwill that any of us were matched with him. Nay, said Sir Gawaine, not\r\nso, it were shame to us were he not assayed, were he never so good a\r\nknight. Well, said Sir Uwaine, I will assay him afore you, for I am\r\nmore weaker than ye, and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me. So\r\nthese two knights came together with great raundon, that Sir Uwaine\r\nsmote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir\r\nMarhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and\r\nhurt Sir Uwaine on the left side.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his\r\nspear, and when Sir Gawaine saw that he dressed his shield, and they\r\naventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of\r\ntheir horses, that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their\r\nshields, but Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s spear brake, but Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 spear held;\r\nand therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth. And\r\nlightly Sir Gawaine rose on his feet, and pulled out his sword, and\r\ndressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that, and\r\npulled out his sword and began to come to Sir Gawaine on horseback. Sir\r\nknight, said Sir Gawaine, alight on foot, or else I will slay thy\r\nhorse. Gramercy, said Sir Marhaus, of your gentleness ye teach me\r\ncourtesy, for it is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on\r\nhorseback. And therewith Sir Marhaus set his spear against a tree and\r\nalighted and tied his horse to a tree, and dressed his shield, and\r\neither came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords\r\nthat their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and\r\ntheir hauberks, and wounded either other. But Sir Gawaine from it\r\npassed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger and stronger, for then it\r\ncame to the hour of noon, and thrice his might was increased. All this\r\nespied Sir Marhaus and had great wonder how his might increased, and so\r\nthey wounded other passing sore. And then when it was past noon, and\r\nwhen it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s strength feebled, and waxed\r\npassing faint that unnethes he might dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus\r\nwas then bigger and bigger. Sir knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well\r\nfelt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might as\r\never I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and\r\ntherefore it were pity to do you hurt, for I feel ye are passing\r\nfeeble. Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I\r\nshould say. And therewith they took off their helms, and either kissed\r\nother, and there they swore together either to love other as brethren.\r\nAnd Sir Marhaus prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. And so\r\nthey took their horses, and rode toward Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 house. And as they\r\nrode by the way, Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, I have marvel that so\r\nvaliant a man as ye be love no ladies nor damosels. Sir, said Sir\r\nMarhaus, they name me wrongfully those that give me that name, but well\r\nI wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name me, and other such\r\nas they be. Now shall I tell you for what cause I hate them: for they\r\nbe sorceresses and enchanters many of them, and be a knight never so\r\ngood of his body and full of prowess as man may be, they will make him\r\na stark coward to have the better of him, and this is the principal\r\ncause that I hate them; and to all good ladies and gentlewomen I owe my\r\nservice as a knight ought to do.\r\n\r\nAs the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that\r\novermatched Sir Gawaine, for all the thrice might that he had: Sir\r\nLauncelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percivale, Sir\r\nPelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir\r\nGawaine. Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 place,\r\nwhich was in a little priory, and there they alighted, and ladies and\r\ndamosels unarmed them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were\r\nall three hurt. And so they had all three good lodging with Sir\r\nMarhaus, and good cheer; for when he wist that they were King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s sons he made them all the cheer that lay in his power, and so\r\nthey sojourned there a sennight, and were well eased of their wounds,\r\nand at the last departed. Now, said Sir Marhaus, we will not depart so\r\nlightly, for I will bring you through the forest; and rode day by day\r\nwell a seven days or they found any adventure. At the last they came\r\ninto a great forest, that was named the country and forest of Arroy,\r\nand the country of strange adventures. In this country, said Sir\r\nMarhaus, came never knight since it was christened but he found strange\r\nadventures; and so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of\r\nstones, and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was\r\nthe head of the stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting\r\nthereby. And then they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the\r\neldest had a garland of gold about her head, and she was three score\r\nwinter of age or more, and her hair was white under the garland. The\r\nsecond damosel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold\r\nabout her head. The third damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a\r\ngarland of flowers about her head. When these knights had so beheld\r\nthem, they asked them the cause why they sat at that fountain? We be\r\nhere, said the damosels, for this cause: if we may see any errant\r\nknights, to teach them unto strange adventures; and ye be three knights\r\nthat seek adventures, and we be three damosels, and therefore each one\r\nof you must choose one of us; and when ye have done so we will lead you\r\nunto three highways, and there each of you shall choose a way and his\r\ndamosel with him. And this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again, and\r\nGod send you your lives, and thereto ye must plight your troth. This is\r\nwell said, said Sir Marhaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How Sir Marhaus, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine met three\r\ndamosels, and each of them took one.\r\n\r\nNow shall everych of us choose a damosel. I shall tell you, said Sir\r\nUwaine, I am the youngest and most weakest of you both, therefore I\r\nwill have the eldest damosel, for she hath seen much, and can best help\r\nme when I have need, for I have most need of help of you both. Now,\r\nsaid Sir Marhaus, I will have the damosel of thirty winter age, for she\r\nfalleth best to me. Well, said Sir Gawaine, I thank you, for ye have\r\nleft me the youngest and the fairest, and she is most liefest to me.\r\nThen every damosel took her knight by the reins of his bridle, and\r\nbrought him to the three ways, and there was their oath made to meet at\r\nthe fountain that day twelvemonth an they were living, and so they\r\nkissed and departed, and each knight set his lady behind him. And Sir\r\nUwaine took the way that lay west, and Sir Marhaus took the way that\r\nlay south, and Sir Gawaine took the way that lay north. Now will we\r\nbegin at Sir Gawaine, that held that way till that he came unto a fair\r\nmanor, where dwelled an old knight and a good householder, and there\r\nSir Gawaine asked the knight if he knew any adventures in that country.\r\nI shall show you some to-morn, said the old knight, and that\r\nmarvellous. So, on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to\r\na laund, and thereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved\r\nthere came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever\r\nthey saw, making the greatest dole that ever man made. And then he was\r\nware of Sir Gawaine, and saluted him, and prayed God to send him much\r\nworship. As to that, said Sir Gawaine, gramercy; also I pray to God\r\nthat he send you honour and worship. Ah, said the knight, I may lay\r\nthat aside, for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith he passed unto the one side of the laund; and on the\r\nother side saw Sir Gawaine ten knights that hoved still and made them\r\nready with their shields and spears against that one knight that came\r\nby Sir Gawaine.\r\n\r\nThen this one knight aventred a great spear, and one of the ten knights\r\nencountered with him, but this woful knight smote him so hard that he\r\nfell over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail. So this same dolorous knight served them\r\nall, that at the leastway he smote down horse and man, and all he did\r\nwith one spear; and so when they were all ten on foot, they went to\r\nthat one knight, and he stood stone still, and suffered them to pull\r\nhim down off his horse, and bound him hand and foot, and tied him under\r\nthe horse\xe2\x80\x99s belly, and so led him with them. O Jesu! said Sir Gawaine,\r\nthis is a doleful sight, to see the yonder knight so to be entreated,\r\nand it seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so, for\r\nhe maketh no resistance. No, said his host, that is truth, for an he\r\nwould they all were too weak so to do him. Sir, said the damosel unto\r\nSir Gawaine, meseemeth it were your worship to help that dolorous\r\nknight, for methinketh he is one of the best knights that ever I saw. I\r\nwould do for him, said Sir Gawaine, but it seemeth he will have no\r\nhelp. Then, said the damosel, methinketh ye have no lust to help him.\r\n\r\nThus as they talked they saw a knight on the other side of the laund\r\nall armed save the head. And on the other side there came a dwarf on\r\nhorseback all armed save the head, with a great mouth and a short nose;\r\nand when the dwarf came nigh he said, Where is the lady should meet us\r\nhere? and therewithal she came forth out of the wood. And then they\r\nbegan to strive for the lady; for the knight said he would have her,\r\nand the dwarf said he would have her. Will we do well? said the dwarf;\r\nyonder is a knight at the cross, let us put it both upon him, and as he\r\ndeemeth so shall it be. I will well, said the knight, and so they went\r\nall three unto Sir Gawaine and told him wherefore they strove. Well,\r\nsirs, said he, will ye put the matter in my hand? Yea, they said both.\r\nNow damosel, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall stand betwixt them both, and\r\nwhether ye list better to go to, he shall have you. And when she was\r\nset between them both, she left the knight and went to the dwarf, and\r\nthe dwarf took her and went his way singing, and the knight went his\r\nway with great mourning.\r\n\r\nThen came there two knights all armed, and cried on high, Sir Gawaine!\r\nknight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, make thee ready in all haste and joust with\r\nme. So they ran together, that either fell down, and then on foot they\r\ndrew their swords, and did full actually. The meanwhile the other\r\nknight went to the damosel, and asked her why she abode with that\r\nknight, and if ye would abide with me, I will be your faithful knight.\r\nAnd with you will I be, said the damosel, for with Sir Gawaine I may\r\nnot find in mine heart to be with him; for now here was one knight\r\ndiscomfited ten knights, and at the last he was cowardly led away; and\r\ntherefore let us two go whilst they fight. And Sir Gawaine fought with\r\nthat other knight long, but at the last they accorded both. And then\r\nthe knight prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. So as Sir\r\nGawaine went with this knight he asked him, What knight is he in this\r\ncountry that smote down the ten knights? For when he had done so\r\nmanfully he suffered them to bind him hand and foot, and so led him\r\naway. Ah, said the knight, that is the best knight I trow in the world,\r\nand the most man of prowess, and he hath been served so as he was even\r\nmore than ten times, and his name hight Sir Pelleas, and he loveth a\r\ngreat lady in this country and her name is Ettard. And so when he loved\r\nher there was cried in this country a great jousts three days, and all\r\nthe knights of this country were there and gentlewomen, and who that\r\nproved him the best knight should have a passing good sword and a\r\ncirclet of gold, and the circlet the knight should give it to the\r\nfairest lady that was at the jousts. And this knight Sir Pelleas was\r\nthe best knight that was there, and there were five hundred knights,\r\nbut there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas met withal but he struck\r\nhim down, or else from his horse; and every day of three days he struck\r\ndown twenty knights, therefore they gave him the prize, and forthwithal\r\nhe went thereas the Lady Ettard was, and gave her the circlet, and said\r\nopenly she was the fairest lady that there was, and that would he prove\r\nupon any knight that would say nay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. How King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner\r\nbecause he would have a sight of his lady, and how Sir Gawaine promised\r\nhim to get to him the love of his lady.\r\n\r\nAnd so he chose her for his sovereign lady, and never to love other but\r\nher, but she was so proud that she had scorn of him, and said that she\r\nwould never love him though he would die for her. Wherefore all ladies\r\nand gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud, for there were\r\nfairer than she, and there was none that was there but an Sir Pelleas\r\nwould have proffered them love, they would have loved him for his noble\r\nprowess. And so this knight promised the Lady Ettard to follow her into\r\nthis country, and never to leave her till she loved him. And thus he is\r\nhere the most part nigh her, and lodged by a priory, and every week she\r\nsendeth knights to fight with him. And when he hath put them to the\r\nworse, then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner, because\r\nhe would have a sight of this lady. And always she doth him great\r\ndespite, for sometime she maketh her knights to tie him to his horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntail, and some to bind him under the horse\xe2\x80\x99s belly; thus in the most\r\nshamefullest ways that she can think he is brought to her. And all she\r\ndoth it for to cause him to leave this country, and to leave his\r\nloving; but all this cannot make him to leave, for an he would have\r\nfought on foot he might have had the better of the ten knights as well\r\non foot as on horseback. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, it is great pity of\r\nhim; and after this night I will seek him to-morrow, in this forest, to\r\ndo him all the help I can. So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of\r\nhis host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met\r\nwith Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them\r\nsaluted other, and asked him why he made such sorrow. And as it is\r\nabove rehearsed, Sir Pelleas told Sir Gawaine: But always I suffer her\r\nknights to fare so with me as ye saw yesterday, in trust at the last to\r\nwin her love, for she knoweth well all her knights should not lightly\r\nwin me, an me list to fight with them to the uttermost. Wherefore an I\r\nloved her not so sore, I had liefer die an hundred times, an I might\r\ndie so oft, rather than I would suffer that despite; but I trust she\r\nwill have pity upon me at the last, for love causeth many a good knight\r\nto suffer to have his entent, but alas I am unfortunate. And therewith\r\nhe made so great dole and sorrow that unnethe he might hold him on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nNow, said Sir Gawaine, leave your mourning and I shall promise you by\r\nthe faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the\r\nlove of your lady, and thereto I will plight you my troth. Ah, said Sir\r\nPelleas, of what court are ye? tell me, I pray you, my good friend. And\r\nthen Sir Gawaine said, I am of the court of King Arthur, and his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s son, and King Lot of Orkney was my father, and my name is Sir\r\nGawaine. And then he said, My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles,\r\nand of many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel\r\ntill now in an unhappy time; and, sir knight, since ye are so nigh\r\ncousin unto King Arthur, and a king\xe2\x80\x99s son, therefore betray me not but\r\nhelp me, for I may never come by her but by some good knight, for she\r\nis in a strong castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all\r\nthis country she is lady of. And so I may never come to her presence,\r\nbut as I suffer her knights to take me, and but if I did so that I\r\nmight have a sight of her, I had been dead long or this time; and yet\r\nfair word had I never of her, but when I am brought to-fore her she\r\nrebuketh me in the foulest manner. And then they take my horse and\r\nharness and put me out of the gates, and she will not suffer me to eat\r\nnor drink; and always I offer me to be her prisoner, but that she will\r\nnot suffer me, for I would desire no more, what pains so ever I had, so\r\nthat I might have a sight of her daily. Well, said Sir Gawaine, all\r\nthis shall I amend an ye will do as I shall devise: I will have your\r\nhorse and your armour, and so will I ride unto her castle and tell her\r\nthat I have slain you, and so shall I come within her to cause her to\r\ncherish me, and then shall I do my true part that ye shall not fail to\r\nhave the love of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. How Sir Gawaine came to the Lady Ettard, and how Sir\r\nPelleas found them sleeping.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith Sir Gawaine plight his troth unto Sir Pelleas to be true\r\nand faithful unto him; so each one plight their troth to other, and so\r\nthey changed horses and harness, and Sir Gawaine departed, and came to\r\nthe castle whereas stood the pavilions of this lady without the gate.\r\nAnd as soon as Ettard had espied Sir Gawaine she fled in toward the\r\ncastle. Sir Gawaine spake on high, and bade her abide, for he was not\r\nSir Pelleas; I am another knight that have slain Sir Pelleas. Do off\r\nyour helm, said the Lady Ettard, that I may see your visage. And so\r\nwhen she saw that it was not Sir Pelleas, she bade him alight and led\r\nhim unto her castle, and asked him faithfully whether he had slain Sir\r\nPelleas. And he said her yea, and told her his name was Sir Gawaine of\r\nthe court of King Arthur, and his sister\xe2\x80\x99s son. Truly, said she, that\r\nis great pity, for he was a passing good knight of his body, but of all\r\nmen alive I hated him most, for I could never be quit of him; and for\r\nye have slain him I shall be your woman, and to do anything that might\r\nplease you. So she made Sir Gawaine good cheer. Then Sir Gawaine said\r\nthat he loved a lady and by no means she would love him. She is to\r\nblame, said Ettard, an she will not love you, for ye that be so well\r\nborn a man, and such a man of prowess, there is no lady in the world\r\ntoo good for you. Will ye, said Sir Gawaine, promise me to do all that\r\nye may, by the faith of your body, to get me the love of my lady? Yea,\r\nsir, said she, and that I promise you by the faith of my body. Now,\r\nsaid Sir Gawaine, it is yourself that I love so well, therefore I pray\r\nyou hold your promise. I may not choose, said the Lady Ettard, but if I\r\nshould be forsworn; and so she granted him to fulfil all his desire.\r\n\r\nSo it was then in the month of May that she and Sir Gawaine went out of\r\nthe castle and supped in a pavilion, and there was made a bed, and\r\nthere Sir Gawaine and the Lady Ettard went to bed together, and in\r\nanother pavilion she laid her damosels, and in the third pavilion she\r\nlaid part of her knights, for then she had no dread of Sir Pelleas. And\r\nthere Sir Gawaine lay with her in that pavilion two days and two\r\nnights. And on the third day, in the morning early, Sir Pelleas armed\r\nhim, for he had never slept since Sir Gawaine departed from him; for\r\nSir Gawaine had promised him by the faith of his body, to come to him\r\nunto his pavilion by that priory within the space of a day and a night.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Pelleas mounted upon horseback, and came to the pavilions that\r\nstood without the castle, and found in the first pavilion three knights\r\nin three beds, and three squires lying at their feet. Then went he to\r\nthe second pavilion and found four gentlewomen lying in four beds. And\r\nthen he yede to the third pavilion and found Sir Gawaine lying in bed\r\nwith his Lady Ettard, and either clipping other in arms, and when he\r\nsaw that his heart well-nigh brast for sorrow, and said: Alas! that\r\never a knight should be found so false; and then he took his horse and\r\nmight not abide no longer for pure sorrow. And when he had ridden nigh\r\nhalf a mile he turned again and thought to slay them both; and when he\r\nsaw them both so lie sleeping fast, unnethe he might hold him on\r\nhorseback for sorrow, and said thus to himself, Though this knight be\r\nnever so false, I will never slay him sleeping, for I will never\r\ndestroy the high order of knighthood; and therewith he departed again.\r\nAnd or he had ridden half a mile he returned again, and thought then to\r\nslay them both, making the greatest sorrow that ever man made. And when\r\nhe came to the pavilions, he tied his horse unto a tree, and pulled out\r\nhis sword naked in his hand, and went to them thereas they lay, and yet\r\nhe thought it were shame to slay them sleeping, and laid the naked\r\nsword overthwart both their throats, and so took his horse and rode his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sir Pelleas came to his pavilions he told his knights and his\r\nsquires how he had sped, and said thus to them, For your true and good\r\nservice ye have done me I shall give you all my goods, for I will go\r\nunto my bed and never arise until I am dead. And when that I am dead I\r\ncharge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her\r\nbetwixt two silver dishes, and tell her how I saw her lie with the\r\nfalse knight Sir Gawaine. Right so Sir Pelleas unarmed himself, and\r\nwent unto his bed making marvellous dole and sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Gawaine and Ettard awoke of their sleep, and found the naked\r\nsword overthwart their throats, then she knew well it was Sir Pelleas\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsword. Alas! said she to Sir Gawaine, ye have betrayed me and Sir\r\nPelleas both, for ye told me ye had slain him, and now I know well it\r\nis not so, he is alive. And if Sir Pelleas had been as uncourteous to\r\nyou as ye have been to him ye had been a dead knight; but ye have\r\ndeceived me and betrayed me falsely, that all ladies and damosels may\r\nbeware by you and me. And therewith Sir Gawaine made him ready, and\r\nwent into the forest. So it happed then that the Damosel of the Lake,\r\nNimue, met with a knight of Sir Pelleas, that went on his foot in the\r\nforest making great dole, and she asked him the cause. And so the woful\r\nknight told her how his master and lord was betrayed through a knight\r\nand lady, and how he will never arise out of his bed till he be dead.\r\nBring me to him, said she anon, and I will warrant his life he shall\r\nnot die for love, and she that hath caused him so to love, she shall be\r\nin as evil plight as he is or it be long to, for it is no joy of such a\r\nproud lady that will have no mercy of such a valiant knight. Anon that\r\nknight brought her unto him, and when she saw him lie in his bed, she\r\nthought she saw never so likely a knight; and therewith she threw an\r\nenchantment upon him, and he fell asleep. And therewhile she rode unto\r\nthe Lady Ettard, and charged no man to awake him till she came again.\r\nSo within two hours she brought the Lady Ettard thither, and both\r\nladies found him asleep: Lo, said the Damosel of the Lake, ye ought to\r\nbe ashamed for to murder such a knight. And therewith she threw such an\r\nenchantment upon her that she loved him sore, that well-nigh she was\r\nout of her mind. O Lord Jesu, said the Lady Ettard, how is it befallen\r\nunto me that I love now him that I have most hated of any man alive?\r\nThat is the righteous judgment of God, said the damosel. And then anon\r\nSir Pelleas awaked and looked upon Ettard; and when he saw her he knew\r\nher, and then he hated her more than any woman alive, and said: Away,\r\ntraitress, come never in my sight. And when she heard him say so, she\r\nwept and made great sorrow out of measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the\r\nDamosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.\r\n\r\nSir knight Pelleas, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse and\r\ncome forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a lady that\r\nshall love you. I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for this Lady Ettard\r\nhath done me great despite and shame, and there he told her the\r\nbeginning and ending, and how he had purposed never to have arisen till\r\nthat he had been dead. And now such grace God hath sent me, that I hate\r\nher as much as ever I loved her, thanked be our Lord Jesus! Thank me,\r\nsaid the Damosel of the Lake. Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his\r\nhorse, and commanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff\r\nwhere the Damosel of the Lake would assign. So the Lady Ettard died for\r\nsorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved\r\ntogether during their life days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he came to\r\nthe Duke of the South Marches.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of thirty\r\nwinter of age, southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by\r\nfortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep way, and at the last\r\nthey came unto a courtelage, and there they asked harbour. But the man\r\nof the courtelage would not lodge them for no treatise that they could\r\ntreat, but thus much the good man said, An ye will take the adventure\r\nof your lodging, I shall bring you where ye shall be lodged. What\r\nadventure is that that I shall have for my lodging? said Sir Marhaus.\r\nYe shall wit when ye come there, said the good man. Sir, what adventure\r\nso it be, bring me thither I pray thee, said Sir Marhaus; for I am\r\nweary, my damosel, and my horse. So the good man went and opened the\r\ngate, and within an hour he brought him unto a fair castle, and then\r\nthe poor man called the porter, and anon he was let into the castle,\r\nand so he told the lord how he brought him a knight errant and a\r\ndamosel that would be lodged with him. Let him in, said the lord, it\r\nmay happen he shall repent that they took their lodging here.\r\n\r\nSo Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly sight\r\nof young men that welcomed him. And then his horse was led into the\r\nstable, and he and the damosel were brought into the hall, and there\r\nstood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him. Then this lord asked\r\nhim what he hight, and from whence he came, and with whom he dwelt.\r\nSir, he said, I am a knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s and knight of the Table\r\nRound, and my name is Sir Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland. And then\r\nsaid the duke to him, That me sore repenteth: the cause is this, for I\r\nlove not thy lord nor none of thy fellows of the Table Round; and\r\ntherefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest, for as\r\nto-morn I and my six sons shall match with you. Is there no remedy but\r\nthat I must have ado with you and your six sons at once? said Sir\r\nMarhaus. No, said the duke, for this cause I made mine avow, for Sir\r\nGawaine slew my seven sons in a recounter, therefore I made mine avow,\r\nthere should never knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court lodge with me, or come\r\nthereas I might have ado with him, but that I would have a revenging of\r\nmy sons\xe2\x80\x99 death. What is your name? said Sir Marhaus; I require you tell\r\nme, an it please you. Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches. Ah,\r\nsaid Sir Marhaus, I have heard say that ye have been long time a great\r\nfoe unto my lord Arthur and to his knights. That shall ye feel to-morn,\r\nsaid the duke. Shall I have ado with you? said Sir Marhaus. Yea, said\r\nthe duke, thereof shalt thou not choose, and therefore take you to your\r\nchamber, and ye shall have all that to you longeth. So Sir Marhaus\r\ndeparted and was led to a chamber, and his damosel was led unto her\r\nchamber. And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus and bade make\r\nhim ready. And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and then there was a\r\nmass sung afore him, and brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in\r\nthe court of the castle where they should do the battle. So there was\r\nthe duke all ready on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons by him,\r\nand everych had a spear in his hand, and so they encountered, whereas\r\nthe duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him, but Sir Marhaus\r\nheld up his spear and touched none of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Marhaus fought with the duke and his four sons and\r\nmade them to yield them.\r\n\r\nThen came the four sons by couple, and two of them brake their spears,\r\nand so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them\r\nnot. Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear\r\nthat horse and man fell to the earth, and so he served his sons; and\r\nthen Sir Marhaus alighted down and bade the duke yield him or else he\r\nwould slay him. And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set\r\nupon Sir Marhaus; then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or\r\nelse I will do the uttermost to you all. Then the duke saw he might not\r\nescape the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them\r\nto Sir Marhaus; and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their\r\nswords to the knight, and so he received them. And then they helped up\r\ntheir father, and so by their cominal assent promised to Sir Marhaus\r\nnever to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after\r\nto come, he and his sons, and put them in the king\xe2\x80\x99s grace.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Marhaus departed, and within two days his damosel brought him\r\nwhereas was a great tournament that the Lady de Vawse had cried. And\r\nwho that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand\r\nbesants. And there Sir Marhaus did so nobly that he was renowned, and\r\nhad sometime down forty knights, and so the circlet of gold was\r\nrewarded him. Then he departed from them with great worship; and so\r\nwithin seven nights his damosel brought him to an earl\xe2\x80\x99s place, his\r\nname was the Earl Fergus, that after was Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s knight; and\r\nthis earl was but a young man, and late come into his lands, and there\r\nwas a giant fast by him that hight Taulurd, and he had another brother\r\nin Cornwall that hight Taulas, that Sir Tristram slew when he was out\r\nof his mind. So this earl made his complaint unto Sir Marhaus, that\r\nthere was a giant by him that destroyed all his lands, and how he durst\r\nnowhere ride nor go for him. Sir, said the knight, whether useth he to\r\nfight on horseback or on foot? Nay, said the earl, there may no horse\r\nbear him. Well, said Sir Marhaus, then will I fight with him on foot;\r\nso on the morn Sir Marhaus prayed the earl that one of his men might\r\nbring him whereas the giant was; and so he was, for he saw him sit\r\nunder a tree of holly, and many clubs of iron and gisarms about him. So\r\nthis knight dressed him to the giant, putting his shield afore him, and\r\nthe giant took an iron club in his hand, and at the first stroke he\r\nclave Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 shield in two pieces. And there he was in great\r\nperil, for the giant was a wily fighter, but at last Sir Marhaus smote\r\noff his right arm above the elbow.\r\n\r\nThen the giant fled and the knight after him, and so he drove him into\r\na water, but the giant was so high that he might not wade after him.\r\nAnd then Sir Marhaus made the Earl Fergus\xe2\x80\x99 man to fetch him stones, and\r\nwith those stones the knight gave the giant many sore knocks, till at\r\nthe last he made him fall down into the water, and so was he there\r\ndead. Then Sir Marhaus went unto the giant\xe2\x80\x99s castle, and there he\r\ndelivered twenty-four ladies and twelve knights out of the giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprison, and there he had great riches without number, so that the days\r\nof his life he was never poor man. Then he returned to the Earl Fergus,\r\nthe which thanked him greatly, and would have given him half his lands,\r\nbut he would none take. So Sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nigh half\r\na year, for he was sore bruised with the giant, and at the last he took\r\nhis leave. And as he rode by the way, he met with Sir Gawaine and Sir\r\nUwaine, and so by adventure he met with four knights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court,\r\nthe first was Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Osanna, Sir Dodinas le\r\nSavage, and Sir Felot of Listinoise; and there Sir Marhaus with one\r\nspear smote down these four knights, and hurt them sore. So he departed\r\nto meet at his day aforeset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Uwaine rode with the damosel of sixty year of\r\nage, and how he gat the prize at tourneying.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Uwaine, that rode westward with his damosel of\r\nthree score winter of age, and she brought him thereas was a tournament\r\nnigh the march of Wales. And at that tournament Sir Uwaine smote down\r\nthirty knights, therefore was given him the prize, and that was a\r\ngerfalcon, and a white steed trapped with cloth of gold. So then Sir\r\nUwaine did many strange adventures by the means of the old damosel, and\r\nso she brought him to a lady that was called the Lady of the Rock, the\r\nwhich was much courteous. So there were in the country two knights that\r\nwere brethren, and they were called two perilous knights, the one\r\nknight hight Sir Edward of the Red Castle, and the other Sir Hue of the\r\nRed Castle; and these two brethren had disherited the Lady of the Rock\r\nof a barony of lands by their extortion. And as this knight was lodged\r\nwith this lady she made her complaint to him of these two knights.\r\n\r\nMadam, said Sir Uwaine, they are to blame, for they do against the high\r\norder of knighthood, and the oath that they made; and if it like you I\r\nwill speak with them, because I am a knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, and I\r\nwill entreat them with fairness; and if they will not, I shall do\r\nbattle with them, and in the defence of your right. Gramercy said the\r\nlady, and thereas I may not acquit you, God shall. So on the morn the\r\ntwo knights were sent for, that they should come thither to speak with\r\nthe Lady of the Rock, and wit ye well they failed not, for they came\r\nwith an hundred horse. But when this lady saw them in this manner so\r\nbig, she would not suffer Sir Uwaine to go out to them upon no surety\r\nnor for no fair language, but she made him speak with them over a\r\ntower, but finally these two brethren would not be entreated, and\r\nanswered that they would keep that they had. Well, said Sir Uwaine,\r\nthen will I fight with one of you, and prove that ye do this lady\r\nwrong. That will we not, said they, for an we do battle, we two will\r\nfight with one knight at once, and therefore if ye will fight so, we\r\nwill be ready at what hour ye will assign. And if ye win us in battle\r\nthe lady shall have her lands again. Ye say well, said Sir Uwaine,\r\ntherefore make you ready so that ye be here to-morn in the defence of\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Uwaine fought with two knights and overcame\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason should be\r\nwrought on neither party; so then the knights departed and made them\r\nready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer. And on the morn he\r\narose early and heard mass, and brake his fast, and so he rode unto the\r\nplain without the gates, where hoved the two brethren abiding him. So\r\nthey rode together passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake\r\ntheir spears upon Sir Uwaine. And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he\r\nfell over his horse and yet his spear brast not. And then he spurred\r\nhis horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon\r\nrecovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade Sir\r\nUwaine alight and do his battle to the uttermost. Then Sir Uwaine\r\ndevoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore him and drew his\r\nsword, and so they dressed together, and either gave other such\r\nstrokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir Uwaine passing\r\ngrievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he should have died. And\r\nthus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason. And at\r\nthe last Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that\r\nhis sword carved unto his canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his\r\ncourage, but Sir Uwaine pressed fast to have slain him. That saw Sir\r\nHue: he kneeled down and yielded him to Sir Uwaine. And he of his\r\ngentleness received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into\r\nthe castle together. Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and\r\nthe other brother made great sorrow for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s death. Then the\r\nlady was restored of all her lands, and Sir Hue was commanded to be at\r\nthe court of King Arthur at the next feast of Pentecost. So Sir Uwaine\r\ndwelt with the lady nigh half a year, for it was long or he might be\r\nwhole of his great hurts. And so when it drew nigh the term-day that\r\nSir Gawaine, Sir Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way,\r\nthen every knight drew him thither to hold his promise that they had\r\nmade; and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them,\r\nbut Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How at the year\xe2\x80\x99s end all three knights with their\r\nthree damosels met at the fountain.\r\n\r\nRight so at the twelvemonths\xe2\x80\x99 end they met all three knights at the\r\nfountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine had could\r\nsay but little worship of him so they departed from the damosels and\r\nrode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that\r\ncame from King Arthur, that had sought them well-nigh a twelvemonth\r\nthroughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he\r\nmight find Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine to bring them to the court again.\r\nAnd then were they all glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride\r\nwith them to the king\xe2\x80\x99s court. And so within twelve days they came to\r\nCamelot, and the king was passing glad of their coming, and so was all\r\nthe court. Then the king made them to swear upon a book to tell him all\r\ntheir adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth, and so they\r\ndid. And there was Sir Marhaus well known, for there were knights that\r\nhe had matched aforetime, and he was named one of the best knights\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAgainst the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and brought\r\nwith her Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was great jousting\r\nof knights, and of all knights that were at that jousts, Sir Pelleas\r\nhad the prize, and Sir Marhaus was named the next; but Sir Pelleas was\r\nso strong there might but few knights sit him a buffet with a spear.\r\nAnd at that next feast Sir Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made knights of\r\nthe Table Round, for there were two sieges void, for two knights were\r\nslain that twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of Sir Pelleas\r\nand of Sir Marhaus. But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawaine, but as\r\nhe spared him for the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts and\r\ntournaments Sir Pelleas quit Sir Gawaine, for so it rehearseth in the\r\nbook of French. So Sir Tristram many days after fought with Sir Marhaus\r\nin an island, and there they did a great battle, but at the last Sir\r\nTristram slew him, so Sir Tristram was wounded that unnethe he might\r\nrecover, and lay at a nunnery half a year. And Sir Pelleas was a\r\nworshipful knight, and was one of the four that achieved the Sangreal,\r\nand the Damosel of the Lake made by her means that never he had ado\r\nwith Sir Launcelot de Lake, for where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts\r\nor any tournament, she would not suffer him be there that day, but if\r\nit were on the side of Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nExplicit liber quartus.\r\nIncipit liber quintus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How twelve aged ambassadors of Rome came to King Arthur to\r\ndemand truage for Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen King Arthur had after long war rested, and held a royal feast and\r\nTable Round with his allies of kings, princes, and noble knights all of\r\nthe Round Table, there came into his hall, he sitting in his throne\r\nroyal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in\r\ntoken that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor\r\nLucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the\r\nPublic Weal of Rome. Which said messengers, after their entering and\r\ncoming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him their obeisance in\r\nmaking to him reverence, and said to him in this wise: The high and\r\nmighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain greeting,\r\ncommanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord, and to send him the\r\ntruage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and other\r\nto-fore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel not\r\nknowing him as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to the\r\nstatutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar,\r\nconqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome. And if thou refuse\r\nhis demand and commandment know thou for certain that he shall make\r\nstrong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee\r\nand thy subjects, that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all kings\r\nand princes, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which\r\ndomineth upon the universal world. Then when they had showed the effect\r\nof their message, the king commanded them to withdraw them, and said he\r\nshould take advice of council and give to them an answer. Then some of\r\nthe young knights, hearing this their message, would have run on them\r\nto have slain them, saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights\r\nthere being present to suffer them to say so to the king. And anon the\r\nking commanded that none of them, upon pain of death, to missay them\r\nnor do them any harm, and commanded a knight to bring them to their\r\nlodging, and see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for\r\nthem, with the best cheer, and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans\r\nbe great lords, and though their message please me not nor my court,\r\nyet I must remember mine honour.\r\n\r\nAfter this the king let call all his lords and knights of the Round\r\nTable to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their\r\nadvice. Then Sir Cador of Cornwall spake first and said, Sir, this\r\nmessage liketh me well, for we have many days rested us and have been\r\nidle, and now I hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans, where I\r\ndoubt not we shall get honour. I believe well, said Arthur, that this\r\nmatter pleaseth thee well, but these answers may not be answered, for\r\nthe demand grieveth me sore, for truly I will never pay truage to Rome,\r\nwherefore I pray you to counsel me. I have understood that Belinus and\r\nBrenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many\r\ndays, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open\r\nevidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right we that be\r\ndescended of them have right to claim the title of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How the kings and lords promised to King Arthur aid and\r\nhelp against the Romans.\r\n\r\nThen answered King Anguish of Scotland, Sir, ye ought of right to be\r\nabove all other kings, for unto you is none like nor pareil in\r\nChristendom, of knighthood nor of dignity, and I counsel you never to\r\nobey the Romans, for when they reigned on us they distressed our\r\nelders, and put this land to great extortions and tallies, wherefore I\r\nmake here mine avow to avenge me on them; and for to strengthen your\r\nquarrel I shall furnish twenty thousand good men of war, and wage them\r\non my costs, which shall await on you with myself when it shall please\r\nyou. And the king of Little Britain granted him to the same thirty\r\nthousand; wherefore King Arthur thanked them. And then every man agreed\r\nto make war, and to aid after their power; that is to wit, the lord of\r\nWest Wales promised to bring thirty thousand men, and Sir Uwaine, Sir\r\nIder his son, with their cousins, promised to bring thirty thousand.\r\nThen Sir Launcelot with all other promised in likewise every man a\r\ngreat multitude.\r\n\r\nAnd when King Arthur understood their courages and good wills he\r\nthanked them heartily, and after let call the ambassadors to hear their\r\nanswer. And in presence of all his lords and knights he said to them in\r\nthis wise: I will that ye return unto your lord and Procuror of the\r\nCommon Weal for the Romans, and say ye to him, Of his demand and\r\ncommandment I set nothing, and that I know of no truage nor tribute\r\nthat I owe to him, nor to none earthly prince, Christian nor heathen;\r\nbut I pretend to have and occupy the sovereignty of the empire, wherein\r\nI am entitled by the right of my predecessors, sometime kings of this\r\nland; and say to him that I am delibered and fully concluded, to go\r\nwith mine army with strength and power unto Rome, by the grace of God,\r\nto take possession in the empire and subdue them that be rebel.\r\nWherefore I command him and all them of Rome, that incontinent they\r\nmake to me their homage, and to acknowledge me for their Emperor and\r\nGovernor, upon pain that shall ensue. And then he commanded his\r\ntreasurer to give to them great and large gifts, and to pay all their\r\ndispenses, and assigned Sir Cador to convey them out of the land. And\r\nso they took their leave and departed, and took their shipping at\r\nSandwich, and passed forth by Flanders, Almaine, the mountains, and all\r\nItaly, until they came unto Lucius. And after the reverence made, they\r\nmade relation of their answer, like as ye to-fore have heard.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor Lucius had well understood their credence, he was sore\r\nmoved as he had been all araged, and said, I had supposed that Arthur\r\nwould have obeyed to my commandment, and have served you himself, as\r\nhim well beseemed or any other king to do. O Sir, said one of the\r\nsenators, let be such vain words, for we let you wit that I and my\r\nfellows were full sore afeard to behold his countenance; I fear me ye\r\nhave made a rod for yourself, for he intendeth to be lord of this\r\nempire, which sore is to be doubted if he come, for he is all another\r\nman than ye ween, and holdeth the most noble court of the world, all\r\nother kings nor princes may not compare unto his noble maintenance. On\r\nNew Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day we saw him in his estate, which was the royalest that\r\never we saw, for he was served at his table with nine kings, and the\r\nnoblest fellowship of other princes, lords, and knights that be in the\r\nworld, and every knight approved and like a lord, and holdeth Table\r\nRound: and in his person the most manly man that liveth, and is like to\r\nconquer all the world, for unto his courage it is too little: wherefore\r\nI advise you to keep well your marches and straits in the mountains;\r\nfor certainly he is a lord to be doubted. Well, said Lucius, before\r\nEaster I suppose to pass the mountains, and so forth into France, and\r\nthere bereave him his lands with Genoese and other mighty warriors of\r\nTuscany and Lombardy. And I shall send for them all that be subjects\r\nand allied to the empire of Rome to come to mine aid. And forthwith\r\nsent old wise knights unto these countries following: first to Ambage\r\nand Arrage, to Alexandria, to India, to Armenia, whereas the river of\r\nEuphrates runneth into Asia, to Africa, and Europe the Large, to\r\nErtayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt, and to Damascus, to Damietta and\r\nCayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus, Turkey, Pontus and Pamphylia, to Syria\r\nand Galatia. And all these were subject to Rome and many more, as\r\nGreece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria, Cateland, Portugal, with many\r\nthousands of Spaniards. Thus all these kings, dukes, and admirals,\r\nassembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at once, with great multitude\r\nof people. When the emperor understood their coming he made ready his\r\nRomans and all the people between him and Flanders.\r\n\r\nAlso he had gotten with him fifty giants which had been engendered of\r\nfiends; and they were ordained to guard his person, and to break the\r\nfront of the battle of King Arthur. And thus departed from Rome, and\r\ncame down the mountains for to destroy the lands that Arthur had\r\nconquered, and came unto Cologne, and besieged a castle thereby, and\r\nwon it soon, and stuffed it with two hundred Saracens or Infidels, and\r\nafter destroyed many fair countries which Arthur had won of King\r\nClaudas. And thus Lucius came with all his host, which were disperplyd\r\nsixty mile in breadth, and commanded them to meet with him in Burgoyne,\r\nfor he purposed to destroy the realm of Little Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How King Arthur held a parliament at York, and how he\r\nordained the realm should be governed in his absence.\r\n\r\nNow leave we of Lucius the Emperor and speak we of King Arthur, that\r\ncommanded all them of his retinue to be ready at the utas of Hilary for\r\nto hold a parliament at York. And at that parliament was concluded to\r\narrest all the navy of the land, and to be ready within fifteen days at\r\nSandwich, and there he showed to his army how he purposed to conquer\r\nthe empire which he ought to have of right. And there he ordained two\r\ngovernors of this realm, that is to say, Sir Baudwin of Britain, for to\r\ncounsel to the best, and Sir Constantine, son to Sir Cador of Cornwall,\r\nwhich after the death of Arthur was king of this realm. And in the\r\npresence of all his lords he resigned the rule of the realm and\r\nGuenever his queen to them, wherefore Sir Launcelot was wroth, for he\r\nleft Sir Tristram with King Mark for the love of Beale Isould. Then the\r\nQueen Guenever made great sorrow for the departing of her lord and\r\nother, and swooned in such wise that the ladies bare her into her\r\nchamber. Thus the king with his great army departed, leaving the queen\r\nand realm in the governance of Sir Baudwin and Constantine. And when he\r\nwas on his horse he said with an high voice, If I die in this journey I\r\nwill that Sir Constantine be mine heir and king crowned of this realm\r\nas next of my blood. And after departed and entered into the sea at\r\nSandwich with all his army, with a great multitude of ships, galleys,\r\ncogs, and dromounds, sailing on the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How King Arthur being shipped and lying in his cabin had a\r\nmarvellous dream and of the exposition thereof.\r\n\r\nAnd as the king lay in his cabin in the ship, he fell in a slumbering\r\nand dreamed a marvellous dream: him seemed that a dreadful dragon did\r\ndrown much of his people, and he came flying out of the west, and his\r\nhead was enamelled with azure, and his shoulders shone as gold, his\r\nbelly like mails of a marvellous hue, his tail full of tatters, his\r\nfeet full of fine sable, and his claws like fine gold; and an hideous\r\nflame of fire flew out of his mouth, like as the land and water had\r\nflamed all of fire. After, him seemed there came out of the orient, a\r\ngrimly boar all black in a cloud, and his paws as big as a post; he was\r\nrugged looking roughly, he was the foulest beast that ever man saw, he\r\nroared and romed so hideously that it were marvel to hear. Then the\r\ndreadful dragon advanced him and came in the wind like a falcon giving\r\ngreat strokes on the boar, and the boar hit him again with his grizzly\r\ntusks that his breast was all bloody, and that the hot blood made all\r\nthe sea red of his blood. Then the dragon flew away all on an height,\r\nand came down with such a swough, and smote the boar on the ridge,\r\nwhich was ten foot large from the head to the tail, and smote the boar\r\nall to powder both flesh and bones, that it flittered all abroad on the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith the king awoke anon, and was sore abashed of this dream,\r\nand sent anon for a wise philosopher, commanding to tell him the\r\nsignification of his dream. Sir, said the philosopher, the dragon that\r\nthou dreamedst of betokeneth thine own person that sailest here, and\r\nthe colours of his wings be thy realms that thou hast won, and his tail\r\nwhich is all to-tattered signifieth the noble knights of the Round\r\nTable; and the boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds\r\nbetokeneth some tyrant that tormenteth the people, or else thou art\r\nlike to fight with some giant thyself, being horrible and abominable,\r\nwhose peer ye saw never in your days, wherefore of this dreadful dream\r\ndoubt thee nothing, but as a conqueror come forth thyself.\r\n\r\nThen after this soon they had sight of land, and sailed till they\r\narrived at Barflete in Flanders, and when they were there he found many\r\nof his great lords ready, as they had been commanded to wait upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How a man of the country told to him of a marvellous giant,\r\nand how he fought and conquered him.\r\n\r\nThen came to him an husbandman of the country, and told him how there\r\nwas in the country of Constantine beside Brittany, a great giant which\r\nhad slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country, and had\r\nbeen sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that\r\nland, insomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed; and\r\nnow late he hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she rode with her\r\nmeiny, and hath led her to his lodging which is in a mountain, for to\r\nravish and lie by her to her life\xe2\x80\x99s end, and many people followed her,\r\nmore than five hundred, but all they might not rescue her, but they\r\nleft her shrieking and crying lamentably, wherefore I suppose that he\r\nhath slain her in fulfilling his foul lust of lechery. She was wife\r\nunto thy cousin Sir Howell, whom we call full nigh of thy blood. Now,\r\nas thou art a rightful king, have pity on this lady, and revenge us all\r\nas thou art a noble conqueror. Alas, said King Arthur, this is a great\r\nmischief, I had liefer than the best realm that I have that I had been\r\na furlong way to-fore him for to have rescued that lady. Now, fellow,\r\nsaid King Arthur, canst thou bring me thereas this giant haunteth? Yea,\r\nSir, said the good man, look yonder whereas thou seest those two great\r\nfires, there shalt thou find him, and more treasure than I suppose is\r\nin all France. When the king had understood this piteous case, he\r\nreturned into his tent.\r\n\r\nThen he called to him Sir Kay and Sir Bedivere, and commanded them\r\nsecretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them twain;\r\nfor after evensong he would ride on pilgrimage with them two only unto\r\nSaint Michael\xe2\x80\x99s mount. And then anon he made him ready, and armed him\r\nat all points, and took his horse and his shield. And so they three\r\ndeparted thence and rode forth as fast as ever they might till that\r\nthey came to the foreland of that mount. And there they alighted, and\r\nthe king commanded them to tarry there, for he would himself go up into\r\nthat mount. And so he ascended up into that hill till he came to a\r\ngreat fire, and there he found a careful widow wringing her hands and\r\nmaking great sorrow, sitting by a grave new made. And then King Arthur\r\nsaluted her, and demanded of her wherefore she made such lamentation,\r\nto whom she answered and said, Sir knight, speak soft, for yonder is a\r\ndevil, if he hear thee speak he will come and destroy thee; I hold thee\r\nunhappy; what dost thou here in this mountain? for if ye were such\r\nfifty as ye be, ye were not able to make resistance against this devil:\r\nhere lieth a duchess dead, the which was the fairest of all the world,\r\nwife to Sir Howell, Duke of Brittany, he hath murdered her in forcing\r\nher, and hath slit her unto the navel.\r\n\r\nDame, said the king, I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur, for\r\nto treat with that tyrant for his liege people. Fie on such treaties,\r\nsaid she, he setteth not by the king nor by no man else; but an if thou\r\nhave brought Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s wife, dame Guenever, he shall be gladder than\r\nthou hadst given to him half France. Beware, approach him not too nigh,\r\nfor he hath vanquished fifteen kings, and hath made him a coat full of\r\nprecious stones embroidered with their beards, which they sent him to\r\nhave his love for salvation of their people at this last Christmas. And\r\nif thou wilt, speak with him at yonder great fire at supper. Well, said\r\nArthur, I will accomplish my message for all your fearful words; and\r\nwent forth by the crest of that hill, and saw where he sat at supper\r\ngnawing on a limb of a man, baking his broad limbs by the fire, and\r\nbreechless, and three fair damosels turning three broaches whereon were\r\nbroached twelve young children late born, like young birds.\r\n\r\nWhen King Arthur beheld that piteous sight he had great compassion on\r\nthem, so that his heart bled for sorrow, and hailed him, saying in this\r\nwise: He that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful\r\ndeath; and the devil have thy soul; why hast thou murdered these young\r\ninnocent children, and murdered this duchess? Therefore, arise and\r\ndress thee, thou glutton, for this day shalt thou die of my hand. Then\r\nthe glutton anon started up, and took a great club in his hand, and\r\nsmote at the king that his coronal fell to the earth. And the king hit\r\nhim again that he carved his belly and cut off his genitours, that his\r\nguts and his entrails fell down to the ground. Then the giant threw\r\naway his club, and caught the king in his arms that he crushed his\r\nribs. Then the three maidens kneeled down and called to Christ for help\r\nand comfort of Arthur. And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he was\r\nother while under and another time above. And so weltering and\r\nwallowing they rolled down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and\r\never as they so weltered Arthur smote him with his dagger.\r\n\r\nAnd it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two knights were and\r\nkept Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s horse; then when they saw the king fast in the giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms they came and loosed him. And then the king commanded Sir Kay to\r\nsmite off the giant\xe2\x80\x99s head, and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear,\r\nand bear it to Sir Howell, and tell him that his enemy was slain; and\r\nafter let this head be bound to a barbican that all the people may see\r\nand behold it; and go ye two up to the mountain, and fetch me my\r\nshield, my sword, and the club of iron; and as for the treasure, take\r\nye it, for ye shall find there goods out of number; so I have the\r\nkirtle and the club I desire no more. This was the fiercest giant that\r\never I met with, save one in the mount of Araby, which I overcame, but\r\nthis was greater and fiercer. Then the knights fetched the club and the\r\nkirtle, and some of the treasure they took to themselves, and returned\r\nagain to the host. And anon this was known through all the country,\r\nwherefore the people came and thanked the king. And he said again, Give\r\nthe thanks to God, and depart the goods among you.\r\n\r\nAnd after that King Arthur said and commanded his cousin Howell, that\r\nhe should ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the\r\nworship of Saint Michael. And on the morn the king removed with his\r\ngreat battle, and came into Champayne and in a valley, and there they\r\npight their tents; and the king being set at his dinner, there came in\r\ntwo messengers, of whom that one was Marshal of France, and said to the\r\nking that the emperor was entered into France, and had destroyed a\r\ngreat part, and was in Burgoyne, and had destroyed and made great\r\nslaughter of people, and burnt towns and boroughs; wherefore, if thou\r\ncome not hastily, they must yield up their bodies and goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur sent Sir Gawaine and other to Lucius, and\r\nhow they were assailed and escaped with worship.\r\n\r\nThen the king did do call Sir Gawaine, Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir\r\nBedivere, and commanded them to go straight to Sir Lucius, and say ye\r\nto him that hastily he remove out of my land; and if he will not, bid\r\nhim make him ready to battle and not distress the poor people. Then\r\nanon these noble knights dressed them to horseback, and when they came\r\nto the green wood, they saw many pavilions set in a meadow, of silk of\r\ndivers colours, beside a river, and the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion was in the\r\nmiddle with an eagle displayed above. To the which tent our knights\r\nrode toward, and ordained Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors to do the message,\r\nand left in a bushment Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere. And then Sir\r\nGawaine and Sir Bors did their message, and commanded Lucius, in\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s name to avoid his land, or shortly to address him to battle.\r\nTo whom Lucius answered and said, Ye shall return to your lord, and say\r\nye to him that I shall subdue him and all his lands. Then Sir Gawaine\r\nwas wroth and said, I had liefer than all France fight against thee;\r\nand so had I, said Sir Bors, liefer than all Brittany or Burgoyne.\r\n\r\nThen a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor, said, Lo,\r\nhow these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag as though\r\nthey bare up all the world. Then Sir Gawaine was sore grieved with\r\nthese words, and pulled out his sword and smote off his head. And\r\ntherewith turned their horses and rode over waters and through woods\r\ntill they came to their bushment, whereas Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere\r\nwere hoving. The Romans followed fast after, on horseback and on foot,\r\nover a champaign unto a wood; then Sir Bors turned his horse and saw a\r\nknight come fast on, whom he smote through the body with a spear that\r\nhe fell dead down to the earth; then came Caliburn one of the strongest\r\nof Pavie, and smote down many of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights. And when Sir Bors\r\nsaw him do so much harm, he addressed toward him, and smote him through\r\nthe breast, that he fell down dead to the earth. Then Sir Feldenak\r\nthought to revenge the death of Gainus upon Sir Gawaine, but Sir\r\nGawaine was ware thereof, and smote him on the head, which stroke\r\nstinted not till it came to his breast. And then he returned and came\r\nto his fellows in the bushment. And there was a recounter, for the\r\nbushment brake on the Romans, and slew and hew down the Romans, and\r\nforced the Romans to flee and return, whom the noble knights chased\r\nunto their tents.\r\n\r\nThen the Romans gathered more people, and also footmen came on, and\r\nthere was a new battle, and so much people that Sir Bors and Sir Berel\r\nwere taken. But when Sir Gawaine saw that, he took with him Sir Idrus\r\nthe good knight, and said he would never see King Arthur but if he\r\nrescued them, and pulled out Galatine his good sword, and followed them\r\nthat led those two knights away; and he smote him that led Sir Bors,\r\nand took Sir Bors from him and delivered him to his fellows. And Sir\r\nIdrus in likewise rescued Sir Berel. Then began the battle to be great,\r\nthat our knights were in great jeopardy, wherefore Sir Gawaine sent to\r\nKing Arthur for succour, and that he hie him, for I am sore wounded,\r\nand that our prisoners may pay goods out of number. And the messenger\r\ncame to the king and told him his message. And anon the king did do\r\nassemble his army, but anon, or he departed the prisoners were come,\r\nand Sir Gawaine and his fellows gat the field and put the Romans to\r\nflight, and after returned and came with their fellowship in such wise\r\nthat no man of worship was lost of them, save that Sir Gawaine was sore\r\nhurt. Then the king did do ransack his wounds and comforted him. And\r\nthus was the beginning of the first journey of the Britons and Romans,\r\nand there were slain of the Romans more than ten thousand, and great\r\njoy and mirth was made that night in the host of King Arthur. And on\r\nthe morn he sent all the prisoners into Paris under the guard of Sir\r\nLauncelot, with many knights, and of Sir Cador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How Lucius sent certain spies in a bushment for to have\r\ntaken his knights being prisoners, and how they were letted.\r\n\r\nNow turn we to the Emperor of Rome, which espied that these prisoners\r\nshould be sent to Paris, and anon he sent to lie in a bushment certain\r\nknights and princes with sixty thousand men, for to rescue his knights\r\nand lords that were prisoners. And so on the morn as Launcelot and Sir\r\nCador, chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the\r\nprisoners, as they should pass through a wood, Sir Launcelot sent\r\ncertain knights to espy if any were in the woods to let them. And when\r\nthe said knights came into the wood, anon they espied and saw the great\r\nembushment, and returned and told Sir Launcelot that there lay in await\r\nfor them three score thousand Romans. And then Sir Launcelot with such\r\nknights as he had, and men of war to the number of ten thousand, put\r\nthem in array, and met with them and fought with them manly, and slew\r\nand detrenched many of the Romans, and slew many knights and admirals\r\nof the party of the Romans and Saracens; there was slain the king of\r\nLyly and three great lords, Aladuke, Herawd, and Heringdale. But Sir\r\nLauncelot fought so nobly that no man might endure a stroke of his\r\nhand, but where he came he showed his prowess and might, for he slew\r\ndown right on every side; and the Romans and Saracens fled from him as\r\nthe sheep from the wolf or from the lion, and put them, all that abode\r\nalive, to flight.\r\n\r\nAnd so long they fought that tidings came to King Arthur, and anon he\r\ngraithed him and came to the battle, and saw his knights how they had\r\nvanquished the battle, he embraced them knight by knight in his arms,\r\nand said, Ye be worthy to wield all your honour and worship; there was\r\nnever king save myself that had so noble knights. Sir, said Cador,\r\nthere was none of us failed other, but of the prowess and manhood of\r\nSir Launcelot were more than wonder to tell, and also of his cousins\r\nwhich did that day many noble feats of war. And also Sir Cador told who\r\nof his knights were slain, as Sir Berel, and other Sir Moris and Sir\r\nMaurel, two good knights. Then the king wept, and dried his eyes with a\r\nkerchief, and said, Your courage had near-hand destroyed you, for\r\nthough ye had returned again, ye had lost no worship; for I call it\r\nfolly, knights to abide when they be overmatched. Nay, said Launcelot\r\nand the other, for once shamed may never be recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How a senator told to Lucius of their discomfiture, and\r\nalso of the great battle between Arthur and Lucius.\r\n\r\nNow leave we King Arthur and his noble knights which had won the field,\r\nand had brought their prisoners to Paris, and speak we of a senator\r\nwhich escaped from the battle, and came to Lucius the emperor, and said\r\nto him, Sir emperor, I advise thee for to withdraw thee; what dost thou\r\nhere? thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great strokes out of\r\nall measure, for this day one of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights was worth in the\r\nbattle an hundred of ours. Fie on thee, said Lucius, thou speakest\r\ncowardly; for thy words grieve me more than all the loss that I had\r\nthis day. And anon he sent forth a king, which hight Sir Leomie, with a\r\ngreat army, and bade him hie him fast to-fore, and he would follow\r\nhastily after. King Arthur was warned privily, and sent his people to\r\nSessoine, and took up the towns and castles from the Romans. Then the\r\nking commanded Sir Cador to take the rearward, and to take with him\r\ncertain knights of the Round Table, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, Sir\r\nKay, Sir Marrok, with Sir Marhaus, shall await on our person. Thus the\r\nKing Arthur disperpled his host in divers parties, to the end that his\r\nenemies should not escape.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor was entered into the vale of Sessoine, he might see\r\nwhere King Arthur was embattled and his banner displayed; and he was\r\nbeset round about with his enemies, that needs he must fight or yield\r\nhim, for he might not flee, but said openly unto the Romans, Sirs, I\r\nadmonish you that this day ye fight and acquit you as men, and remember\r\nhow Rome domineth and is chief and head over all the earth and\r\nuniversal world, and suffer not these Britons this day to abide against\r\nus; and therewith he did command his trumpets to blow the bloody\r\nsounds, in such wise that the ground trembled and dindled.\r\n\r\nThen the battles approached and shoved and shouted on both sides, and\r\ngreat strokes were smitten on both sides, many men overthrown, hurt,\r\nand slain; and great valiances, prowesses and appertices of war were\r\nthat day showed, which were over long to recount the noble feats of\r\nevery man, for they should contain an whole volume. But in especial,\r\nKing Arthur rode in the battle exhorting his knights to do well, and\r\nhimself did as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do; he\r\ndrew out Excalibur his sword, and awaited ever whereas the Romans were\r\nthickest and most grieved his people, and anon he addressed him on that\r\npart, and hew and slew down right, and rescued his people; and he slew\r\na great giant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and\r\nheight, he shorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees,\r\nsaying, Now art thou better of a size to deal with than thou were, and\r\nafter smote off his head. There Sir Gawaine fought nobly and slew three\r\nadmirals in that battle. And so did all the knights of the Round Table.\r\nThus the battle between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor endured\r\nlong. Lucius had on his side many Saracens which were slain. And thus\r\nthe battle was great, and oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and\r\nanon at an afterdeal, which endured so long till at the last King\r\nArthur espied where Lucius the Emperor fought, and did wonder with his\r\nown hands. And anon he rode to him. And either smote other fiercely,\r\nand at last Lucius smote Arthur thwart the visage, and gave him a large\r\nwound. And when King Arthur felt himself hurt, anon he smote him again\r\nwith Excalibur that it cleft his head, from the summit of his head, and\r\nstinted not till it came to his breast. And then the emperor fell down\r\ndead and there ended his life.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was known that the emperor was slain, anon all the Romans\r\nwith all their host put them to flight, and King Arthur with all his\r\nknights followed the chase, and slew down right all them that they\r\nmight attain. And thus was the victory given to King Arthur, and the\r\ntriumph; and there were slain on the part of Lucius more than an\r\nhundred thousand. And after King Arthur did do ransack the dead bodies,\r\nand did do bury them that were slain of his retinue, every man\r\naccording to the estate and degree that he was of. And them that were\r\nhurt he let the surgeons do search their hurts and wounds, and\r\ncommanded to spare no salves nor medicines till they were whole.\r\n\r\nThen the king rode straight to the place where the Emperor Lucius lay\r\ndead, and with him he found slain the Soudan of Syria, the King of\r\nEgypt and of Ethiopia, which were two noble kings, with seventeen other\r\nkings of divers regions, and also sixty senators of Rome, all noble\r\nmen, whom the king did do balm and gum with many good gums aromatic,\r\nand after did do cere them in sixty fold of cered cloth of sendal, and\r\nlaid them in chests of lead, because they should not chafe nor savour,\r\nand upon all these bodies their shields with their arms and banners\r\nwere set, to the end they should be known of what country they were.\r\nAnd after he found three senators which were alive, to whom he said,\r\nFor to save your lives I will that ye take these dead bodies, and carry\r\nthem with you unto great Rome, and present them to the Potestate on my\r\nbehalf, shewing him my letters, and tell them that I in my person shall\r\nhastily be at Rome. And I suppose the Romans shall beware how they\r\nshall demand any tribute of me. And I command you to say when ye shall\r\ncome to Rome, to the Potestate and all the Council and Senate, that I\r\nsend to them these dead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded.\r\nAnd if they be not content with these, I shall pay more at my coming,\r\nfor other tribute owe I none, nor none other will I pay. And methinketh\r\nthis sufficeth for Britain, Ireland and all Almaine with Germany. And\r\nfurthermore, I charge you to say to them, that I command them upon pain\r\nof their heads never to demand tribute nor tax of me nor of my lands.\r\nThen with this charge and commandment, the three senators aforesaid\r\ndeparted with all the said dead bodies, laying the body of Lucius in a\r\ncar covered with the arms of the Empire all alone; and after alway two\r\nbodies of kings in a chariot, and then the bodies of the senators after\r\nthem, and so went toward Rome, and showed their legation and message to\r\nthe Potestate and Senate, recounting the battle done in France, and how\r\nthe field was lost and much people and innumerable slain. Wherefore\r\nthey advised them in no wise to move no more war against that noble\r\nconqueror Arthur, for his might and prowess is most to be doubted, seen\r\nthe noble kings and great multitude of knights of the Round Table, to\r\nwhom none earthly prince may compare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How Arthur, after he had achieved the battle against the\r\nRomans, entered into Almaine, and so into Italy.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto King Arthur and his noble knights, which, after the\r\ngreat battle achieved against the Romans, entered into Lorraine,\r\nBrabant and Flanders, and sithen returned into Haut Almaine, and so\r\nover the mountains into Lombardy, and after, into Tuscany wherein was a\r\ncity which in no wise would yield themself nor obey, wherefore King\r\nArthur besieged it, and lay long about it, and gave many assaults to\r\nthe city; and they within defended them valiantly. Then, on a time, the\r\nking called Sir Florence, a knight, and said to him they lacked\r\nvictual, And not far from hence be great forests and woods, wherein be\r\nmany of mine enemies with much bestial: I will that thou make thee\r\nready and go thither in foraying, and take with thee Sir Gawaine my\r\nnephew, Sir Wisshard, Sir Clegis, Sir Cleremond, and the Captain of\r\nCardiff with other, and bring with you all the beasts that ye there can\r\nget.\r\n\r\nAnd anon these knights made them ready, and rode over holts and hills,\r\nthrough forests and woods, till they came into a fair meadow full of\r\nfair flowers and grass; and there they rested them and their horses all\r\nthat night. And in the springing of the day in the next morn, Sir\r\nGawaine took his horse and stole away from his fellowship, to seek some\r\nadventures. And anon he was ware of a man armed, walking his horse\r\neasily by a wood\xe2\x80\x99s side, and his shield laced to his shoulder, sitting\r\non a strong courser, without any man saving a page bearing a mighty\r\nspear. The knight bare in his shield three griffins of gold, in sable\r\ncarbuncle, the chief of silver. When Sir Gawaine espied this gay\r\nknight, he feutred his spear, and rode straight to him, and demanded of\r\nhim from whence that he was. That other answered and said he was of\r\nTuscany, and demanded of Sir Gawaine, What, profferest thou, proud\r\nknight, thee so boldly? here gettest thou no prey, thou mayest prove\r\nwhat thou wilt, for thou shalt be my prisoner or thou depart. Then said\r\nGawaine, thou avauntest thee greatly and speakest proud words, I\r\ncounsel thee for all thy boast that thou make thee ready, and take thy\r\ngear to thee, to-fore greater grame fall to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. Of a battle done by Sir Gawaine against a Saracen, which\r\nafter was yielden and became Christian.\r\n\r\nThen they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might\r\nthey had, and smote each other through their shields into their\r\nshoulders, wherefore anon they pulled out their swords, and smote great\r\nstrokes that the fire sprang out of their helms. Then Sir Gawaine was\r\nall abashed, and with Galatine his good sword he smote through shield\r\nand thick hauberk made of thick mails, and all to-rushed and break the\r\nprecious stones, and made him a large wound, that men might see both\r\nliver and lung. Then groaned that knight, and addressed him to Sir\r\nGawaine, and with an awk stroke gave him a great wound and cut a vein,\r\nwhich grieved Gawaine sore, and he bled sore. Then the knight said to\r\nSir Gawaine, bind thy wound or thy blee[ding] change, for thou\r\nbe-bleedest all thy horse and thy fair arms, for all the barbers of\r\nBrittany shall not con staunch thy blood, for whosomever is hurt with\r\nthis blade he shall never be staunched of bleeding. Then answered\r\nGawaine, it grieveth me but little, thy great words shall not fear me\r\nnor lessen my courage, but thou shalt suffer teen and sorrow or we\r\ndepart, but tell me in haste who may staunch my bleeding. That may I\r\ndo, said the knight, if I will, and so will I if thou wilt succour and\r\naid me, that I may be christened and believe on God, and thereof I\r\nrequire thee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit for thy soul.\r\nI grant, said Gawaine, so God help me, to accomplish all thy desire,\r\nbut first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of what land\r\nand liegiance thou art of. Sir, he said, my name is Priamus, and a\r\ngreat prince is my father, and he hath been rebel unto Rome and\r\noverridden many of their lands. My father is lineally descended of\r\nAlexander and of Hector by right line. And Duke Joshua and Maccabaeus\r\nwere of our lineage. I am right inheritor of Alexandria and Africa, and\r\nall the out isles, yet will I believe on thy Lord that thou believest\r\non; and for thy labour I shall give thee treasure enough. I was so\r\nelate and hauteyn in my heart that I thought no man my peer, nor to me\r\nsemblable. I was sent into this war with seven score knights, and now I\r\nhave encountered with thee, which hast given to me of fighting my fill,\r\nwherefore sir knight, I pray thee to tell me what thou art. I am no\r\nknight, said Gawaine, I have been brought up in the guardrobe with the\r\nnoble King Arthur many years, for to take heed to his armour and his\r\nother array, and to point his paltocks that long to himself. At Yule\r\nlast he made me yeoman, and gave to me horse and harness, and an\r\nhundred pound in money; and if fortune be my friend, I doubt not but to\r\nbe well advanced and holpen by my liege lord. Ah, said Priamus, if his\r\nknaves be so keen and fierce, his knights be passing good: now for the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s love of Heaven, whether thou be a knave or a knight, tell thou\r\nme thy name. By God, said Sir Gawaine, now I will say thee sooth, my\r\nname is Sir Gawaine, and known I am in his court and in his chamber,\r\nand one of the knights of the Round Table, he dubbed me a duke with his\r\nown hand. Therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned, it is\r\nthe goodness of God that lent to me my strength. Now am I better\r\npleased, said Priamus, than thou hadst given to me all the Provence and\r\nParis the rich. I had liefer to have been torn with wild horses, than\r\nany varlet had won such loos, or any page or priker should have had\r\nprize on me. But now sir knight I warn thee that hereby is a Duke of\r\nLorraine with his army, and the noblest men of Dolphiny, and lords of\r\nLombardy, with the garrison of Godard, and Saracens of Southland,\r\ny-numbered sixty thousand of good men of arms; wherefore but if we hie\r\nus hence, it will harm us both, for we be sore hurt, never like to\r\nrecover; but take heed to my page, that he no horn blow, for if he do,\r\nthere be hoving here fast by an hundred knights awaiting on my person,\r\nand if they take thee, there shall no ransom of gold nor silver acquit\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Gawaine rode over a water for to save him, and the knight\r\nfollowed him, and so rode forth till they came to his fellows which\r\nwere in the meadow, where they had been all the night. Anon as Sir\r\nWisshard was ware of Sir Gawaine and saw that he was hurt, he ran to\r\nhim sorrowfully weeping, and demanded of him who had so hurt him; and\r\nGawaine told how he had foughten with that man, and each of them had\r\nhurt other, and how he had salves to heal them; but I can tell you\r\nother tidings, that soon we shall have ado with many enemies.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Priamus and Sir Gawaine alighted, and let their horses graze\r\nin the meadow, and unarmed them, and then the blood ran freshly from\r\ntheir wounds. And Priamus took from his page a vial full of the four\r\nwaters that came out of Paradise, and with certain balm anointed their\r\nwounds, and washed them with that water, and within an hour after they\r\nwere both as whole as ever they were. And then with a trumpet were they\r\nall assembled to council, and there Priamus told unto them what lords\r\nand knights had sworn to rescue him, and that without fail they should\r\nbe assailed with many thousands, wherefore he counselled them to\r\nwithdraw them. Then Sir Gawaine said, it were great shame to them to\r\navoid without any strokes; Wherefore I advise to take our arms and to\r\nmake us ready to meet with these Saracens and misbelieving men, and\r\nwith the help of God we shall overthrow them and have a fair day on\r\nthem. And Sir Florence shall abide still in this field to keep the\r\nstale as a noble knight, and we shall not forsake yonder fellows. Now,\r\nsaid Priamus, cease your words, for I warn you ye shall find in yonder\r\nwoods many perilous knights; they will put forth beasts to call you on,\r\nthey be out of number, and ye are not past seven hundred, which be over\r\nfew to fight with so many. Nevertheless, said Sir Gawaine, we shall\r\nonce encounter them, and see what they can do, and the best shall have\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How the Saracens came out of a wood for to rescue their\r\nbeasts, and of a great battle.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Florence called to him Sir Floridas, with an hundred knights,\r\nand drove forth the herd of beasts. Then followed him seven hundred men\r\nof arms; and Sir Ferant of Spain on a fair steed came springing out of\r\nthe woods, and came to Sir Florence and asked him why he fled. Then Sir\r\nFlorence took his spear and rode against him, and smote him in the\r\nforehead and brake his neck bone. Then all the other were moved, and\r\nthought to avenge the death of Sir Ferant, and smote in among them, and\r\nthere was great fight, and many slain and laid down to ground, and Sir\r\nFlorence with his hundred knights alway kept the stale, and fought\r\nmanly.\r\n\r\nThen when Priamus the good knight perceived the great fight, he went to\r\nSir Gawaine, and bade him that he should go and succour his fellowship,\r\nwhich were sore bestead with their enemies. Sir, grieve you not, said\r\nSir Gawaine, for their gree shall be theirs. I shall not once move my\r\nhorse to them ward, but if I see more than there be; for they be strong\r\nenough to match them.\r\n\r\nAnd with that he saw an earl called Sir Ethelwold and the duke of\r\nDutchmen, came leaping out of a wood with many thousands, and Priamus\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknights, and came straight unto the battle. Then Sir Gawaine comforted\r\nhis knights, and bade them not to be abashed, for all shall be ours.\r\nThen they began to wallop and met with their enemies, there were men\r\nslain and overthrown on every side. Then thrust in among them the\r\nknights of the Table Round, and smote down to the earth all them that\r\nwithstood them, in so much that they made them to recoil and flee. By\r\nGod, said Sir Gawaine, this gladdeth my heart, for now be they less in\r\nnumber by twenty thousand. Then entered into the battle Jubance a\r\ngiant, and fought and slew down right, and distressed many of our\r\nknights, among whom was slain Sir Gherard, a knight of Wales. Then our\r\nknights took heart to them, and slew many Saracens. And then came in\r\nSir Priamus with his pennon, and rode with the knights of the Round\r\nTable, and fought so manfully that many of their enemies lost their\r\nlives. And there Sir Priamus slew the Marquis of Moises land, and Sir\r\nGawaine with his fellows so quit them that they had the field, but in\r\nthat stour was Sir Chestelaine, a child and ward of Sir Gawaine slain,\r\nwherefore was much sorrow made, and his death was soon avenged. Thus\r\nwas the battle ended, and many lords of Lombardy and Saracens left dead\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Florence and Sir Gawaine harboured surely their people, and\r\ntook great plenty of bestial, of gold and silver, and great treasure\r\nand riches, and returned unto King Arthur, which lay still at the\r\nsiege. And when they came to the king they presented their prisoners\r\nand recounted their adventures, and how they had vanquished their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Gawaine returned to King Arthur with his\r\nprisoners, and how the King won a city, and how he was crowned Emperor.\r\n\r\nNow thanked be God, said the noble King Arthur. But what manner man is\r\nhe that standeth by himself, him seemeth no prisoner. Sir, said\r\nGawaine, this is a good man of arms, he hath matched me, but he is\r\nyielden unto God, and to me, for to become Christian; had not he have\r\nbeen we should never have returned, wherefore I pray you that he may be\r\nbaptised, for there liveth not a nobler man nor better knight of his\r\nhands. Then the king let him anon be christened, and did do call him\r\nhis first name Priamus, and made him a duke and knight of the Table\r\nRound. And then anon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there\r\nwas rearing of ladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that\r\nmen with little pain might enter into the city. Then came out a\r\nduchess, and Clarisin the countess, with many ladies and damosels, and\r\nkneeling before King Arthur, required him for the love of God to\r\nreceive the city, and not to take it by assault, for then should many\r\nguiltless be slain. Then the king avaled his visor with a meek and\r\nnoble countenance, and said, Madam, there shall none of my subjects\r\nmisdo you nor your maidens, nor to none that to you belong, but the\r\nduke shall abide my judgment. Then anon the king commanded to leave the\r\nassault, and anon the duke\xe2\x80\x99s oldest son brought out the keys, and\r\nkneeling delivered them to the king, and besought him of grace; and the\r\nking seized the town by assent of his lords, and took the duke and sent\r\nhim to Dover, there for to abide prisoner term of his life, and\r\nassigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThen he made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought to do\r\nin his own country; and after he took his journey toward Rome, and sent\r\nSir Floris and Sir Floridas to-fore, with five hundred men of arms, and\r\nthey came to the city of Urbino and laid there a bushment, thereas them\r\nseemed most best for them, and rode to-fore the town, where anon issued\r\nout much people and skirmished with the fore-riders. Then brake out the\r\nbushment and won the bridge, and after the town, and set upon the walls\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s banner. Then came the king upon an hill, and saw the city\r\nand his banner on the walls, by which he knew that the city was won.\r\nAnd anon he sent and commanded that none of his liege men should defoul\r\nnor lie by no lady, wife nor maid; and when he came into the city, he\r\npassed to the castle, and comforted them that were in sorrow, and\r\nordained there a captain, a knight of his own country.\r\n\r\nAnd when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent to King\r\nArthur great sums of money, and besought him as their lord to have pity\r\non them, promising to be his subjects for ever, and yield to him homage\r\nand fealty for the lands of Pleasance and Pavia, Petersaint, and the\r\nPort of Tremble, and to give him yearly a million of gold all his\r\nlifetime. Then he rideth into Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles,\r\nand wasted all in his way that to him will not obey, and so to Spolute\r\nand Viterbe, and from thence he rode into the Vale of Vicecount among\r\nthe vines. And from thence he sent to the senators, to wit whether they\r\nwould know him for their lord. But soon after on a Saturday came unto\r\nKing Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest\r\ncardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of peace, and\r\nproferred him full large, and besought him as governor to give licence\r\nfor six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him\r\nemperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate. I assent, said\r\nthe king, like as ye have devised, and at Christmas there to be\r\ncrowned, and to hold my Round Table with my knights as me liketh. And\r\nthen the senators made ready for his enthronization. And at the day\r\nappointed, as the romance telleth, he came into Rome, and was crowned\r\nemperor by the pope\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with all the royalty that could be made,\r\nand sojourned there a time, and established all his lands from Rome\r\ninto France, and gave lands and realms unto his servants and knights,\r\nto everych after his desert, in such wise that none complained, rich\r\nnor poor. And he gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine; and he\r\nthanked him, and said he would serve him the days of his life; and\r\nafter made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.\r\n\r\nThen after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore him, and\r\nsaid: Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest achieved,\r\nin so much that we know none so great nor mighty that dare make war\r\nagainst you: wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give us\r\nlicence to go home to our wives, from whom we have been long, and to\r\nrest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship. Then\r\nsaid the king, Ye say truth, and for to tempt God it is no wisdom, and\r\ntherefore make you ready and return we into England. Then there was\r\ntrussing of harness and baggage and great carriage. And after licence\r\ngiven, he returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should\r\nnot rob nor take victual, nor other thing by the way but that he should\r\npay therefore. And thus he came over the sea and landed at Sandwich,\r\nagainst whom Queen Guenever his wife came and met him, and he was nobly\r\nreceived of all his commons in every city and burgh, and great gifts\r\npresented to him at his home-coming to welcome him with.\r\n\r\nThus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur had against\r\nLucius the Emperor of Rome, and here followeth the sixth book, which is\r\nof Sir Launcelot du Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court,\r\nand how Sir Lionel left him sleeping and was taken.\r\n\r\nSoon after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then all\r\nthe knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and made many\r\njousts and tournaments, and some there were that were but knights,\r\nwhich increased so in arms and worship that they passed all their\r\nfellows in prowess and noble deeds, and that was well proved on many;\r\nbut in especial it was proved on Sir Launcelot du Lake, for in all\r\ntournaments and jousts and deeds of arms, both for life and death, he\r\npassed all other knights, and at no time he was never overcome but if\r\nit were by treason or enchantment; so Sir Launcelot increased so\r\nmarvellously in worship, and in honour, therefore is he the first\r\nknight that the French book maketh mention of after King Arthur came\r\nfrom Rome. Wherefore Queen Guenever had him in great favour above all\r\nother knights, and in certain he loved the queen again above all other\r\nladies and damosels of his life, and for her he did many deeds of arms,\r\nand saved her from the fire through his noble chivalry.\r\n\r\nThus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game. And then he\r\nthought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then he bade\r\nhis nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him ready; for we two will seek\r\nadventures. So they mounted on their horses, armed at all rights, and\r\nrode into a deep forest and so into a deep plain. And then the weather\r\nwas hot about noon, and Sir Launcelot had great lust to sleep. Then Sir\r\nLionel espied a great apple-tree that stood by an hedge, and said,\r\nBrother, yonder is a fair shadow, there may we rest us [and] our\r\nhorses. It is well said, fair brother, said Sir Launcelot, for this\r\neight year I was not so sleepy as I am now; and so they there alighted\r\nand tied their horses unto sundry trees, and so Sir Launcelot laid him\r\ndown under an appletree, and his helm he laid under his head. And Sir\r\nLionel waked while he slept. So Sir Launcelot was asleep passing fast.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast fleeing\r\nas ever they might ride. And there followed them three but one knight.\r\nAnd when Sir Lionel saw him, him thought he saw never so great a\r\nknight, nor so well faring a man, neither so well apparelled unto all\r\nrights. So within a while this strong knight had overtaken one of these\r\nknights, and there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still.\r\nAnd then he rode unto the second knight, and smote him so that man and\r\nhorse fell down. And then straight to the third knight he rode, and\r\nsmote him behind his horse\xe2\x80\x99s arse a spear length. And then he alighted\r\ndown and reined his horse on the bridle, and bound all the three\r\nknights fast with the reins of their own bridles. When Sir Lionel saw\r\nhim do thus, he thought to assay him, and made him ready, and stilly\r\nand privily he took his horse, and thought not for to awake Sir\r\nLauncelot. And when he was mounted upon his horse, he overtook this\r\nstrong knight, and bade him turn, and the other smote Sir Lionel so\r\nhard that horse and man he bare to the earth, and so he alighted down\r\nand bound him fast, and threw him overthwart his own horse, and so he\r\nserved them all four, and rode with them away to his own castle. And\r\nwhen he came there he gart unarm them, and beat them with thorns all\r\nnaked, and after put them in a deep prison where were many more\r\nknights, that made great dolour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Ector followed for to seek Sir Launcelot, and how\r\nhe was taken by Sir Turquine.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Ector de Maris wist that Sir Launcelot was passed out of the\r\ncourt to seek adventures, he was wroth with himself, and made him ready\r\nto seek Sir Launcelot, and as he had ridden long in a great forest he\r\nmet with a man was like a forester. Fair fellow, said Sir Ector,\r\nknowest thou in this country any adventures that be here nigh hand?\r\nSir, said the forester, this country know I well, and hereby, within\r\nthis mile, is a strong manor, and well dyked, and by that manor, on the\r\nleft hand, there is a fair ford for horses to drink of, and over that\r\nford there groweth a fair tree, and thereon hang many fair shields that\r\nwielded sometime good knights, and at the hole of the tree hangeth a\r\nbasin of copper and latten, and strike upon that basin with the butt of\r\nthy spear thrice, and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings, and else\r\nhast thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever knight that\r\npassed through this forest. Gramercy, said Sir Ector, and departed and\r\ncame to the tree, and saw many fair shields. And among them he saw his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s shield, Sir Lionel, and many more that he knew that were his\r\nfellows of the Round Table, the which grieved his heart, and promised\r\nto revenge his brother.\r\n\r\nThen anon Sir Ector beat on the basin as he were wood, and then he gave\r\nhis horse drink at the ford, and there came a knight behind him and\r\nbade him come out of the water and make him ready; and Sir Ector anon\r\nturned him shortly, and in feuter cast his spear, and smote the other\r\nknight a great buffet that his horse turned twice about. This was well\r\ndone, said the strong knight, and knightly thou hast stricken me; and\r\ntherewith he rushed his horse on Sir Ector, and cleight him under his\r\nright arm, and bare him clean out of the saddle, and rode with him away\r\ninto his own hall, and threw him down in midst of the floor. The name\r\nof this knight was Sir Turquine. Then he said unto Sir Ector, For thou\r\nhast done this day more unto me than any knight did these twelve years,\r\nnow will I grant thee thy life, so thou wilt be sworn to be my prisoner\r\nall thy life days. Nay, said Sir Ector, that will I never promise thee,\r\nbut that I will do mine advantage. That me repenteth, said Sir\r\nTurquine. And then he gart to unarm him, and beat him with thorns all\r\nnaked, and sithen put him down in a deep dungeon, where he knew many of\r\nhis fellows. But when Sir Ector saw Sir Lionel, then made he great\r\nsorrow. Alas, brother, said Sir Ector, where is my brother Sir\r\nLauncelot? Fair brother, I left him asleep when that I from him yode,\r\nunder an apple-tree, and what is become of him I cannot tell you. Alas,\r\nsaid the knights, but Sir Launcelot help us we may never be delivered,\r\nfor we know now no knight that is able to match our master Turquine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How four queens found Launcelot sleeping, and how by\r\nenchantment he was taken and led into a castle.\r\n\r\nNow leave we these knights prisoners, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du\r\nLake that lieth under the apple-tree sleeping. Even about the noon\r\nthere came by him four queens of great estate; and, for the heat should\r\nnot annoy them, there rode four knights about them, and bare a cloth of\r\ngreen silk on four spears, betwixt them and the sun, and the queens\r\nrode on four white mules. Thus as they rode they heard by them a great\r\nhorse grimly neigh, then were they ware of a sleeping knight, that lay\r\nall armed under an apple-tree; anon as these queens looked on his face,\r\nthey knew it was Sir Launcelot. Then they began for to strive for that\r\nknight, everych one said they would have him to her love. We shall not\r\nstrive, said Morgan le Fay, that was King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sister, I shall put\r\nan enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in six hours, and then\r\nI will lead him away unto my castle, and when he is surely within my\r\nhold, I shall take the enchantment from him, and then let him choose\r\nwhich of us he will have unto paramour.\r\n\r\nSo this enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot, and then they laid him\r\nupon his shield, and bare him so on horseback betwixt two knights, and\r\nbrought him unto the castle Chariot, and there they laid him in a\r\nchamber cold, and at night they sent unto him a fair damosel with his\r\nsupper ready dight. By that the enchantment was past, and when she came\r\nshe saluted him, and asked him what cheer. I cannot say, fair damosel,\r\nsaid Sir Launcelot, for I wot not how I came into this castle but it be\r\nby an enchantment. Sir, said she, ye must make good cheer, and if ye be\r\nsuch a knight as it is said ye be, I shall tell you more to-morn by\r\nprime of the day. Gramercy, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of your\r\ngood will I require you. And so she departed. And there he lay all that\r\nnight without comfort of anybody. And on the morn early came these four\r\nqueens, passingly well beseen, all they bidding him good morn, and he\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\nSir knight, the four queens said, thou must understand thou art our\r\nprisoner, and we here know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot du\r\nLake, King Ban\xe2\x80\x99s son, and because we understand your worthiness, that\r\nthou art the noblest knight living, and as we know well there can no\r\nlady have thy love but one, and that is Queen Guenever, and now thou\r\nshalt lose her for ever, and she thee, and therefore thee behoveth now\r\nto choose one of us four. I am the Queen Morgan le Fay, queen of the\r\nland of Gore, and here is the queen of Northgalis, and the queen of\r\nEastland, and the queen of the Out Isles; now choose one of us which\r\nthou wilt have to thy paramour, for thou mayest not choose or else in\r\nthis prison to die. This is an hard case, said Sir Launcelot, that\r\neither I must die or else choose one of you, yet had I liefer to die in\r\nthis prison with worship, than to have one of you to my paramour maugre\r\nmy head. And therefore ye be answered, I will none of you, for ye be\r\nfalse enchantresses, and as for my lady, Dame Guenever, were I at my\r\nliberty as I was, I would prove it on you or on yours, that she is the\r\ntruest lady unto her lord living. Well, said the queens, is this your\r\nanswer, that ye will refuse us. Yea, on my life, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nrefused ye be of me. So they departed and left him there alone that\r\nmade great sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was delivered by the mean of a damosel.\r\n\r\nRight so at the noon came the damosel unto him with his dinner, and\r\nasked him what cheer. Truly, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, in my\r\nlife days never so ill. Sir, she said, that me repenteth, but an ye\r\nwill be ruled by me, I shall help you out of this distress, and ye\r\nshall have no shame nor villainy, so that ye hold me a promise. Fair\r\ndamosel, I will grant you, and sore I am of these queen-sorceresses\r\nafeard, for they have destroyed many a good knight. Sir, said she, that\r\nis sooth, and for the renown and bounty that they hear of you they\r\nwould have your love, and Sir, they say, your name is Sir Launcelot du\r\nLake, the flower of knights, and they be passing wroth with you that ye\r\nhave refused them. But Sir, an ye would promise me to help my father on\r\nTuesday next coming, that hath made a tournament betwixt him and the\r\nKing of Northgalis\xe2\x80\x94for the last Tuesday past my father lost the field\r\nthrough three knights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court\xe2\x80\x94an ye will be there on Tuesday\r\nnext coming, and help my father, to-morn or prime, by the grace of God,\r\nI shall deliver you clean. Fair maiden, said Sir Launcelot, tell me\r\nwhat is your father\xe2\x80\x99s name, and then shall I give you an answer. Sir\r\nknight, she said, my father is King Bagdemagus, that was foul rebuked\r\nat the last tournament. I know your father well, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nfor a noble king and a good knight, and by the faith of my body, ye\r\nshall have my body ready to do your father and you service at that day.\r\nSir, she said, gramercy, and to-morn await ye be ready betimes and I\r\nshall be she that shall deliver you and take you your armour and your\r\nhorse, shield and spear, and hereby within this ten mile, is an abbey\r\nof white monks, there I pray you that ye me abide, and thither shall I\r\nbring my father unto you. All this shall be done, said Sir Launcelot as\r\nI am true knight.\r\n\r\nAnd so she departed, and came on the morn early, and found him ready;\r\nthen she brought him out of twelve locks, and brought him unto his\r\narmour, and when he was clean armed, she brought him until his own\r\nhorse, and lightly he saddled him and took a great spear in his hand\r\nand so rode forth, and said, Fair damosel, I shall not fail you, by the\r\ngrace of God. And so he rode into a great forest all that day, and\r\nnever could find no highway and so the night fell on him, and then was\r\nhe ware in a slade, of a pavilion of red sendal. By my faith, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, in that pavilion will I lodge all this night, and so there\r\nhe alighted down, and tied his horse to the pavilion, and there he\r\nunarmed him, and there he found a bed, and laid him therein and fell\r\nasleep sadly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How a knight found Sir Launcelot lying in his leman\xe2\x80\x99s bed,\r\nand how Sir Launcelot fought with the knight.\r\n\r\nThen within an hour there came the knight to whom the pavilion ought,\r\nand he weened that his leman had lain in that bed, and so he laid him\r\ndown beside Sir Launcelot, and took him in his arms and began to kiss\r\nhim. And when Sir Launcelot felt a rough beard kissing him, he started\r\nout of the bed lightly, and the other knight after him, and either of\r\nthem gat their swords in their hands, and out at the pavilion door went\r\nthe knight of the pavilion, and Sir Launcelot followed him, and there\r\nby a little slake Sir Launcelot wounded him sore, nigh unto the death.\r\nAnd then he yielded him unto Sir Launcelot, and so he granted him, so\r\nthat he would tell him why he came into the bed. Sir, said the knight,\r\nthe pavilion is mine own, and there this night I had assigned my lady\r\nto have slept with me, and now I am likely to die of this wound. That\r\nme repenteth, said Launcelot, of your hurt, but I was adread of\r\ntreason, for I was late beguiled, and therefore come on your way into\r\nyour pavilion and take your rest, and as I suppose I shall staunch your\r\nblood. And so they went both into the pavilion, and anon Sir Launcelot\r\nstaunched his blood.\r\n\r\nTherewithal came the knight\xe2\x80\x99s lady, that was a passing fair lady, and\r\nwhen she espied that her lord Belleus was sore wounded, she cried out\r\non Sir Launcelot, and made great dole out of measure. Peace, my lady\r\nand my love, said Belleus, for this knight is a good man, and a knight\r\nadventurous, and there he told her all the cause how he was wounded;\r\nAnd when that I yielded me unto him, he left me goodly and hath\r\nstaunched my blood. Sir, said the lady, I require thee tell me what\r\nknight ye be, and what is your name? Fair lady, he said, my name is Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake. So me thought ever by your speech, said the lady,\r\nfor I have seen you oft or this, and I know you better than ye ween.\r\nBut now an ye would promise me of your courtesy, for the harms that ye\r\nhave done to me and my Lord Belleus, that when he cometh unto Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt for to cause him to be made knight of the Round Table, for he is\r\na passing good man of arms, and a mighty lord of lands of many out\r\nisles.\r\n\r\nFair lady, said Sir Launcelot, let him come unto the court the next\r\nhigh feast, and look that ye come with him, and I shall do my power, an\r\nye prove you doughty of your hands, that ye shall have your desire. So\r\nthus within a while, as they thus talked, the night passed, and the day\r\nshone, and then Sir Launcelot armed him, and took his horse, and they\r\ntaught him to the Abbey, and thither he rode within the space of two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot was received of King Bagdemagus\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndaughter, and how he made his complaint to her father.\r\n\r\nAnd soon as Sir Launcelot came within the abbey yard, the daughter of\r\nKing Bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement. And she then\r\narose and yede unto a window, and there she saw Sir Launcelot, and anon\r\nshe made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a\r\nstable, and himself was led into a fair chamber, and unarmed him, and\r\nthe lady sent him a long gown, and anon she came herself. And then she\r\nmade Launcelot passing good cheer, and she said he was the knight in\r\nthe world was most welcome to her. Then in all haste she sent for her\r\nfather Bagdemagus that was within twelve mile of that Abbey, and afore\r\neven he came, with a fair fellowship of knights with him. And when the\r\nking was alighted off his horse he yode straight unto Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber and there he found his daughter, and then the king embraced Sir\r\nLauncelot in his arms, and either made other good cheer.\r\n\r\nAnon Sir Launcelot made his complaint unto the king how he was\r\nbetrayed, and how his brother Sir Lionel was departed from him he wist\r\nnot where, and how his daughter had delivered him out of prison;\r\nTherefore while I live I shall do her service and all her kindred. Then\r\nam I sure of your help, said the king, on Tuesday next coming. Yea,\r\nsir, said Sir Launcelot, I shall not fail you, for so I have promised\r\nmy lady your daughter. But, sir, what knights be they of my lord\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s that were with the King of Northgalis? And the king said it\r\nwas Sir Mador de la Porte, and Sir Mordred and Sir Gahalantine that all\r\nfor-fared my knights, for against them three I nor my knights might\r\nbear no strength. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, as I hear say that the\r\ntournament shall be here within this three mile of this abbey, ye shall\r\nsend unto me three knights of yours, such as ye trust, and look that\r\nthe three knights have all white shields, and I also, and no painture\r\non the shields, and we four will come out of a little wood in midst of\r\nboth parties, and we shall fall in the front of our enemies and grieve\r\nthem that we may; and thus shall I not be known what knight I am.\r\n\r\nSo they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and so\r\nthe king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the\r\nfour white shields. And on the Tuesday they lodged them in a little\r\nleaved wood beside there the tournament should be. And there were\r\nscaffolds and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to give the\r\nprize. Then came into the field the King of Northgalis with eight score\r\nhelms. And then the three knights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s stood by themselves. Then\r\ncame into the field King Bagdemagus with four score of helms. And then\r\nthey feutred their spears, and came together with a great dash, and\r\nthere were slain of knights at the first recounter twelve of King\r\nBagdemagus\xe2\x80\x99 party, and six of the King of Northgalis\xe2\x80\x99 party, and King\r\nBagdemagus\xe2\x80\x99 party was far set aback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him in a tournament, and how he\r\nmet with Sir Turquine leading Sir Gaheris.\r\n\r\nWith that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he thrust in with his spear\r\nin the thickest of the press, and there he smote down with one spear\r\nfive knights, and of four of them he brake their backs. And in that\r\nthrong he smote down the King of Northgalis, and brake his thigh in\r\nthat fall. All this doing of Sir Launcelot saw the three knights of\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s. Yonder is a shrewd guest, said Sir Mador de la Porte,\r\ntherefore have here once at him. So they encountered, and Sir Launcelot\r\nbare him down horse and man, so that his shoulder went out of lith. Now\r\nbefalleth it to me to joust, said Mordred, for Sir Mador hath a sore\r\nfall. Sir Launcelot was ware of him, and gat a great spear in his hand,\r\nand met him, and Sir Mordred brake a spear upon him, and Sir Launcelot\r\ngave him such a buffet that the arson of his saddle brake, and so he\r\nflew over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail, that his helm butted into the earth a foot\r\nand more, that nigh his neck was broken, and there he lay long in a\r\nswoon.\r\n\r\nThen came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot against\r\nhim, with all their strength that they might drive, that both their\r\nspears to-brast even to their hands, and then they flang out with their\r\nswords and gave many a grim stroke. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of\r\nmeasure, and then he smote Sir Gahalantine on the helm that his nose\r\nbrast out on blood, and ears and mouth both, and therewith his head\r\nhung low. And therewith his horse ran away with him, and he fell down\r\nto the earth. Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his\r\nhand, and or ever that great spear brake, he bare down to the earth\r\nsixteen knights, some horse and man, and some the man and not the\r\nhorse, and there was none but that he hit surely, he bare none arms\r\nthat day. And then he gat another great spear, and smote down twelve\r\nknights, and the most part of them never throve after. And then the\r\nknights of the King of Northgalis would joust no more. And there the\r\ngree was given to King Bagdemagus.\r\n\r\nSo either party departed unto his own place, and Sir Launcelot rode\r\nforth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle, and there he had passing\r\ngood cheer both with the king and with his daughter, and they proffered\r\nhim great gifts. And on the morn he took his leave, and told the king\r\nthat he would go and seek his brother Sir Lionel, that went from him\r\nwhen that he slept, so he took his horse, and betaught them all to God.\r\nAnd there he said unto the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, If ye have need any time of\r\nmy service I pray you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you\r\nas I am true knight. And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he\r\ncame into the same forest there he was taken sleeping. And in the midst\r\nof a highway he met a damosel riding on a white palfrey, and there\r\neither saluted other. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, know ye in this\r\ncountry any adventures? Sir knight, said that damosel, here are\r\nadventures near hand, an thou durst prove them. Why should I not prove\r\nadventures? said Sir Launcelot for that cause come I hither. Well, said\r\nshe, thou seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou dare meet with\r\na good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best knight, and the\r\nmightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me what is thy name,\r\nand what knight thou art. Damosel, as for to tell thee my name I take\r\nno great force; truly my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Sir, thou\r\nbeseemest well, here be adventures by that fall for thee, for hereby\r\ndwelleth a knight that will not be overmatched for no man I know but ye\r\novermatch him, and his name is Sir Turquine. And, as I understand, he\r\nhath in his prison, of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, good knights three score and\r\nfour, that he hath won with his own hands. But when ye have done that\r\njourney ye shall promise me as ye are a true knight for to go with me,\r\nand to help me and other damosels that are distressed daily with a\r\nfalse knight. All your intent, damosel, and desire I will fulfil, so ye\r\nwill bring me unto this knight. Now, fair knight, come on your way; and\r\nso she brought him unto the ford and the tree where hung the basin.\r\n\r\nSo Sir Launcelot let his horse drink, and then he beat on the basin\r\nwith the butt of his spear so hard with all his might till the bottom\r\nfell out, and long he did so, but he saw nothing. Then he rode endlong\r\nthe gates of that manor nigh half-an-hour. And then was he ware of a\r\ngreat knight that drove an horse afore him, and overthwart the horse\r\nthere lay an armed knight bound. And ever as they came near and near,\r\nSir Launcelot thought he should know him. Then Sir Launcelot was ware\r\nthat it was Sir Gaheris, Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s brother, a knight of the Table\r\nRound. Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I see yonder cometh a\r\nknight fast bounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he is unto\r\nSir Gawaine. And at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave of\r\nGod, to rescue that knight; but if his master sit better in the saddle\r\nI shall deliver all the prisoners that he hath out of danger, for I am\r\nsure he hath two brethren of mine prisoners with him. By that time that\r\neither had seen other, they gripped their spears unto them. Now, fair\r\nknight, said Sir Launcelot, put that wounded knight off the horse, and\r\nlet him rest awhile, and let us two prove our strengths; for as it is\r\ninformed me, thou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto\r\nknights of the Round Table, and therefore now defend thee. An thou be\r\nof the Table Round, said Turquine, I defy thee and all thy fellowship.\r\nThat is overmuch said, said Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquine fought together.\r\n\r\nAnd then they put their spears in the rests, and came together with\r\ntheir horses as fast as they might run, and either smote other in midst\r\nof their shields, that both their horses\xe2\x80\x99 backs brast under them, and\r\nthe knights were both stonied. And as soon as they might avoid their\r\nhorses, they took their shields afore them, and drew out their swords,\r\nand came together eagerly, and either gave other many strong strokes,\r\nfor there might neither shields nor harness hold their strokes. And so\r\nwithin a while they had both grimly wounds, and bled passing\r\ngrievously. Thus they fared two hours or more trasing and rasing either\r\nother, where they might hit any bare place.\r\n\r\nThen at the last they were breathless both, and stood leaning on their\r\nswords. Now fellow, said Sir Turquine, hold thy hand a while, and tell\r\nme what I shall ask thee. Say on. Then Turquine said, Thou art the\r\nbiggest man that ever I met withal, and the best breathed, and like one\r\nknight that I hate above all other knights; so be it that thou be not\r\nhe I will lightly accord with thee, and for thy love I will deliver all\r\nthe prisoners that I have, that is three score and four, so thou wilt\r\ntell me thy name. And thou and I we will be fellows together, and never\r\nto fail thee while that I live. It is well said, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nbut sithen it is so that I may have thy friendship, what knight is he\r\nthat thou so hatest above all other? Faithfully, said Sir Turquine, his\r\nname is Sir Launcelot du Lake, for he slew my brother, Sir Carados, at\r\nthe dolorous tower, that was one of the best knights alive; and\r\ntherefore him I except of all knights, for may I once meet with him,\r\nthe one of us shall make an end of other, I make mine avow. And for Sir\r\nLauncelot\xe2\x80\x99s sake I have slain an hundred good knights, and as many I\r\nhave maimed all utterly that they might never after help themselves,\r\nand many have died in prison, and yet have I three score and four, and\r\nall shall be delivered so thou wilt tell me thy name, so be it that\r\nthou be not Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nNow, see I well, said Sir Launcelot, that such a man I might be, I\r\nmight have peace, and such a man I might be, that there should be war\r\nmortal betwixt us. And now, sir knight, at thy request I will that thou\r\nwit and know that I am Launcelot du Lake, King Ban\xe2\x80\x99s son of Benwick,\r\nand very knight of the Table Round. And now I defy thee, and do thy\r\nbest. Ah, said Turquine, Launcelot, thou art unto me most welcome that\r\never was knight, for we shall never depart till the one of us be dead.\r\nThen they hurtled together as two wild bulls rushing and lashing with\r\ntheir shields and swords, that sometime they fell both over their\r\nnoses. Thus they fought still two hours and more, and never would have\r\nrest, and Sir Turquine gave Sir Launcelot many wounds that all the\r\nground thereas they fought was all bespeckled with blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Turquine was slain, and how Sir Launcelot bade Sir\r\nGaheris deliver all the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThen at the last Sir Turquine waxed faint, and gave somewhat aback, and\r\nbare his shield low for weariness. That espied Sir Launcelot, and leapt\r\nupon him fiercely and gat him by the beaver of his helmet, and plucked\r\nhim down on his knees, and anon he raced off his helm, and smote his\r\nneck in sunder. And when Sir Launcelot had done this, he yode unto the\r\ndamosel and said, Damosel, I am ready to go with you where ye will have\r\nme, but I have no horse. Fair sir, said she, take this wounded knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse and send him into this manor, and command him to deliver all the\r\nprisoners. So Sir Launcelot went unto Gaheris, and prayed him not to be\r\naggrieved for to lend him his horse. Nay, fair lord, said Gaheris, I\r\nwill that ye take my horse at your own commandment, for ye have both\r\nsaved me and my horse, and this day I say ye are the best knight in the\r\nworld, for ye have slain this day in my sight the mightiest man and the\r\nbest knight except you that ever I saw, and, fair sir, said Gaheris, I\r\npray you tell me your name. Sir, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, that\r\nought to help you of right for King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and in especial for\r\nmy lord Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s sake, your own dear brother; and when that ye\r\ncome within yonder manor, I am sure ye shall find there many knights of\r\nthe Round Table, for I have seen many of their shields that I know on\r\nyonder tree. There is Kay\xe2\x80\x99s shield, and Sir Brandel\xe2\x80\x99s shield, and Sir\r\nMarhaus\xe2\x80\x99 shield, and Sir Galind\xe2\x80\x99s shield, and Sir Brian de Listnois\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshield, and Sir Aliduke\xe2\x80\x99s shield, with many more that I am not now\r\nadvised of, and also my two brethren\xe2\x80\x99s shields, Sir Ector de Maris and\r\nSir Lionel; wherefore I pray you greet them all from me, and say that I\r\nbid them take such stuff there as they find, and that in any wise my\r\nbrethren go unto the court and abide me there till that I come, for by\r\nthe feast of Pentecost I cast me to be there, for as at this time I\r\nmust ride with this damosel for to save my promise.\r\n\r\nAnd so he departed from Gaheris, and Gaheris yede in to the manor, and\r\nthere he found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys. Anon withal Sir\r\nGaheris threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him,\r\nand hastily he opened the prison door, and there he let out all the\r\nprisoners, and every man loosed other of their bonds. And when they saw\r\nSir Gaheris, all they thanked him, for they weened that he was wounded.\r\nNot so, said Gaheris, it was Launcelot that slew him worshipfully with\r\nhis own hands. I saw it with mine own eyes. And he greeteth you all\r\nwell, and prayeth you to haste you to the court; and as unto Sir Lionel\r\nand Ector de Maris he prayeth you to abide him at the court. That shall\r\nwe not do, says his brethren, we will find him an we may live. So shall\r\nI, said Sir Kay, find him or I come at the court, as I am true knight.\r\n\r\nThen all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was, and\r\nthen they armed them, and every knight found his own horse, and all\r\nthat ever longed unto him. And when this was done, there came a\r\nforester with four horses laden with fat venison. Anon, Sir Kay said,\r\nHere is good meat for us for one meal, for we had not many a day no\r\ngood repast. And so that venison was roasted, baken, and sodden, and so\r\nafter supper some abode there all night, but Sir Lionel and Ector de\r\nMaris and Sir Kay rode after Sir Launcelot to find him if they might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot rode with a damosel and slew a knight that\r\ndistressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a fair\r\nhighway. Sir, said the damosel, here by this way haunteth a knight that\r\ndistressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the least he robbeth them\r\nor lieth by them. What, said Sir Launcelot, is he a thief and a knight\r\nand a ravisher of women? he doth shame unto the order of knighthood,\r\nand contrary unto his oath; it is pity that he liveth. But, fair\r\ndamosel, ye shall ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in\r\ncovert, and if that he trouble you or distress you I shall be your\r\nrescue and learn him to be ruled as a knight.\r\n\r\nSo the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace, and within a while\r\ncame out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his page with\r\nhim, and there he put the damosel from her horse, and then she cried.\r\nWith that came Launcelot as fast as he might till he came to that\r\nknight, saying, O thou false knight and traitor unto knighthood, who\r\ndid learn thee to distress ladies and gentlewomen? When the knight saw\r\nSir Launcelot thus rebuking him he answered not, but drew his sword and\r\nrode unto Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw his spear from him,\r\nand drew out his sword, and struck him such a buffet on the helmet that\r\nhe clave his head and neck unto the throat. Now hast thou thy payment\r\nthat long thou hast deserved! That is truth, said the damosel, for like\r\nas Sir Turquine watched to destroy knights, so did this knight attend\r\nto destroy and distress ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen, and his name\r\nwas Sir Peris de Forest Savage. Now, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, will\r\nye any more service of me? Nay, sir, she said, at this time, but\r\nalmighty Jesu preserve you wheresomever ye ride or go, for the curteist\r\nknight thou art, and meekest unto all ladies and gentlewomen, that now\r\nliveth. But one thing, sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a\r\nknight wifeless, that he will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for\r\nI could never hear say that ever ye loved any of no manner degree, and\r\nthat is great pity; but it is noised that ye love Queen Guenever, and\r\nthat she hath ordained by enchantment that ye shall never love none\r\nother but her, nor none other damosel nor lady shall rejoice you;\r\nwherefore many in this land, of high estate and low, make great sorrow.\r\n\r\nFair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I may not warn people to speak of me\r\nwhat it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think it not; for\r\nthen I must couch with her, and leave arms and tournaments, battles,\r\nand adventures; and as for to say for to take my pleasaunce with\r\nparamours, that will I refuse in principal for dread of God; for\r\nknights that be adventurous or lecherous shall not be happy nor\r\nfortunate unto the wars, for other they shall be overcome with a\r\nsimpler knight than they be themselves, other else they shall by unhap\r\nand their cursedness slay better men than they be themselves. And so\r\nwho that useth paramours shall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy\r\nthat is about them.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Launcelot and she departed. And then he rode in a deep\r\nforest two days and more, and had strait lodging. So on the third day\r\nhe rode over a long bridge, and there stert upon him suddenly a passing\r\nfoul churl, and he smote his horse on the nose that he turned about,\r\nand asked him why he rode over that bridge without his licence. Why\r\nshould I not ride this way? said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride beside.\r\nThou shalt not choose, said the churl, and lashed at him with a great\r\nclub shod with iron. Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and put the\r\nstroke aback, and clave his head unto the paps. At the end of the\r\nbridge was a fair village, and all the people, men and women, cried on\r\nSir Launcelot, and said, A worse deed didst thou never for thyself, for\r\nthou hast slain the chief porter of our castle. Sir Launcelot let them\r\nsay what they would, and straight he went into the castle; and when he\r\ncame into the castle he alighted, and tied his horse to a ring on the\r\nwall and there he saw a fair green court, and thither he dressed him,\r\nfor there him thought was a fair place to fight in. So he looked about,\r\nand saw much people in doors and windows that said, Fair knight, thou\r\nart unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free.\r\n\r\nAnon withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed all save\r\nthe heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put\r\nhis shield afore him and put the stroke away of the one giant, and with\r\nhis sword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow saw that, he ran\r\naway as he were wood, for fear of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot\r\nafter him with all his might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave\r\nhim to the navel. Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came\r\nafore him three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him,\r\nand thanked God and him of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the\r\nmost party of us have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we\r\nhave worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great\r\ngentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be\r\nborn, for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this\r\nworld, that will we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your\r\nname, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison. Fair\r\ndamosel, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, sir, said they\r\nall, well mayest thou be he, for else save yourself, as we deemed,\r\nthere might never knight have the better of these two giants; for many\r\nfair knights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have\r\nwe wished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but you.\r\nNow may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how and who hath\r\ndelivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in any of\r\nyour marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what treasure\r\nthat there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for your\r\ngrievance, and the lord that is owner of this castle I would he\r\nreceived it as is right. Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle\r\nis Tintagil, and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine,\r\nand after wedded her Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur. Well, said\r\nSir Launcelot, I understand to whom this castle longeth; and so he\r\ndeparted from them, and betaught them unto God.\r\n\r\nAnd then he mounted upon his horse, and rode into many strange and wild\r\ncountries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he lodged.\r\nAnd at the last by fortune him happened, against a night, to come to a\r\nfair courtelage, and therein he found an old gentlewoman that lodged\r\nhim with good will, and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.\r\nAnd when time was, his host brought him into a fair garret, over the\r\ngate, to his bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness\r\nby him, and went to bed, and anon he fell asleep. So, soon after, there\r\ncame one on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste, and when\r\nSir Launcelot heard this, he arose up and looked out at the window, and\r\nsaw by the moonlight three knights came riding after that one man, and\r\nall three lashed on him at once with swords, and that one knight turned\r\non them knightly again, and defended him. Truly, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nyonder one knight shall I help, for it were shame for me to see three\r\nknights on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his death; and\r\ntherewith he took his harness, and went out at a window by a sheet down\r\nto the four knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you\r\nknights unto me, and leave your fighting with that knight. And then\r\nthey all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there\r\nbegan great battle, for they alighted all three, and struck many great\r\nstrokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay\r\ndressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he, I will\r\nnone of your help; therefore as ye will have my help, let me alone with\r\nthem. Sir Kay, for the pleasure of the knight, suffered him for to do\r\nhis will, and so stood aside. And then anon within six strokes, Sir\r\nLauncelot had stricken them to the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd then they all three cried: Sir knight, we yield us unto you as a\r\nman of might makeless. As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take\r\nyour yielding unto me. But so that ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the\r\nSeneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives, and else not. Fair\r\nknight, said they, that were we loath to do; for as for Sir Kay, we\r\nchased him hither, and had overcome him had not ye been, therefore to\r\nyield us unto him it were no reason. Well, as to that, said Launcelot,\r\nadvise you well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an\r\nye be yolden it shall be unto Sir Kay. Fair knight, then they said, in\r\nsaving of our lives we will do as thou commandest us. Then shall ye,\r\nsaid Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming, go unto the court of\r\nKing Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever, and put\r\nyou all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you\r\nthither to be her prisoners. Sir, they said, it shall be done by the\r\nfaith of our bodies, an we be living, and there they swore every knight\r\nupon his sword. And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. And\r\nthen Sir Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword,\r\nand with that came his host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he. Sir,\r\nsaid his host, I weened ye had been in your bed. So I was, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, but I rose and leapt out at my window for to help an old\r\nfellow of mine. And so when they came nigh the light, Sir Kay knew well\r\nthat it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down and thanked\r\nhim of all his kindness that he had holpen him twice from the death.\r\nSir, he said, I have nothing done but that me ought for to do, and ye\r\nare welcome, and here shall ye repose you and take your rest.\r\n\r\nSo when Sir Kay was unarmed, he asked after meat; so there was meat\r\nfetched him, and he ate strongly. And when he had supped they went to\r\ntheir beds and were lodged together in one bed. On the morn Sir\r\nLauncelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping, and Sir Launcelot\r\ntook Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s armour and his shield, and armed him, and so he went to\r\nthe stable, and took his horse, and took his leave of his host, and so\r\nhe departed. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot.\r\nAnd then he espied that he had his armour and his horse. Now by my\r\nfaith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of King Arthur;\r\nfor on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will\r\nbeguile them. And because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall\r\nride in peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s harness, and\r\nhow he smote down a knight.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great forest,\r\nand at the last he came into a low country, full of fair rivers and\r\nmeadows. And afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood\r\nthereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. And without the pavilions\r\nhung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great long spears\r\nstood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion\xe2\x80\x99s door stood\r\nthree fresh squires, and so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no\r\nword. When he was passed the three knights said them that it was the\r\nproud Kay; He weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is\r\nofttime proved. By my faith, said one of the knights, his name was Sir\r\nGaunter, I will ride after him and assay him for all his pride, and ye\r\nmay behold how that I speed. So this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him,\r\nand hung his shield upon his shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse,\r\nand gat his spear in his hand, and walloped after Sir Launcelot. And\r\nwhen he came nigh him, he cried, Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for\r\nthou shalt not pass quit. So Sir Launcelot turned him, and either\r\nfeutred their spears, and came together with all their mights, and Sir\r\nGaunter\xe2\x80\x99s spear brake, but Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man.\r\nAnd when Sir Gaunter was at the earth his brethren said each one to\r\nother, Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he is bigger than he. I dare\r\nlay my head, said Sir Gilmere, yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and\r\nhath taken his horse and his harness. Whether it be so or no, said Sir\r\nRaynold, the third brother, let us now go mount upon our horses and\r\nrescue our brother Sir Gaunter, upon pain of death. We all shall have\r\nwork enough to match that knight, for ever meseemeth by his person it\r\nis Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Pelleas, the good knight.\r\n\r\nThen anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir\r\nGilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir\r\nLauncelot smote him down that he lay in a swoon. Sir knight, said Sir\r\nRaynold, thou art a strong man, and as I suppose thou hast slain my two\r\nbrethren, for the which raseth my heart sore against thee, and if I\r\nmight with my worship I would not have ado with you, but needs I must\r\ntake part as they do, and therefore, knight, he said, keep thyself. And\r\nso they hurtled together with all their mights, and all to-shivered\r\nboth their spears. And then they drew their swords and lashed together\r\neagerly. Anon therewith arose Sir Gaunter, and came unto his brother\r\nSir Gilmere, and bade him, Arise, and help we our brother Sir Raynold,\r\nthat yonder marvellously matched yonder good knight. Therewithal, they\r\nleapt on their horses and hurtled unto Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nAnd when he saw them come he smote a sore stroke unto Sir Raynold, that\r\nhe fell off his horse to the ground, and then he struck to the other\r\ntwo brethren, and at two strokes he struck them down to the earth. With\r\nthat Sir Raynold began to start up with his head all bloody, and came\r\nstraight unto Sir Launcelot. Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was not\r\nfar from thee when thou wert made knight, Sir Raynold, and also I know\r\nthou art a good knight, and loath I were to slay thee. Gramercy, said\r\nSir Raynold, as for your goodness; and I dare say as for me and my\r\nbrethren, we will not be loath to yield us unto you, with that we knew\r\nyour name, for well we know ye are not Sir Kay. As for that be it as it\r\nbe may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever, and look that ye be\r\nwith her on Whitsunday, and yield you unto her as prisoners, and say\r\nthat Sir Kay sent you unto her. Then they swore it should be done, and\r\nso passed forth Sir Launcelot, and each one of the brethren holp other\r\nas well as they might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Launcelot jousted against four knights of the\r\nRound Table and overthrew them.\r\n\r\nSo Sir Launcelot rode into a deep forest, and thereby in a slade, he\r\nsaw four knights hoving under an oak, and they were of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court,\r\none was Sir Sagramour le Desirous, and Ector de Maris, and Sir Gawaine,\r\nand Sir Uwaine. Anon as these four knights had espied Sir Launcelot,\r\nthey weened by his arms it had been Sir Kay. Now by my faith, said Sir\r\nSagramour, I will prove Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s might, and gat his spear in his hand,\r\nand came toward Sir Launcelot. Therewith Sir Launcelot was ware and\r\nknew him well, and feutred his spear against him, and smote Sir\r\nSagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the earth. Lo, my\r\nfellows, said he, yonder ye may see what a buffet he hath; that knight\r\nis much bigger than ever was Sir Kay. Now shall ye see what I may do to\r\nhim. So Sir Ector gat his spear in his hand and walloped toward Sir\r\nLauncelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him through the shield and shoulder,\r\nthat man and horse went to the earth, and ever his spear held.\r\n\r\nBy my faith, said Sir Uwaine, yonder is a strong knight, and I am sure\r\nhe hath slain Sir Kay; and I see by his great strength it will be hard\r\nto match him. And therewithal, Sir Uwaine gat his spear in his hand and\r\nrode toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot knew him well, and so he\r\nmet him on the plain, and gave him such a buffet that he was astonied,\r\nthat long he wist not where he was. Now see I well, said Sir Gawaine, I\r\nmust encounter with that knight. Then he dressed his shield and gat a\r\ngood spear in his hand, and Sir Launcelot knew him well; and then they\r\nlet run their horses with all their mights, and either knight smote\r\nother in midst of the shield. But Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s spear to-brast, and Sir\r\nLauncelot charged so sore upon him that his horse reversed up-so-down.\r\nAnd much sorrow had Sir Gawaine to avoid his horse, and so Sir\r\nLauncelot passed on a pace and smiled, and said, God give him joy that\r\nthis spear made, for there came never a better in my hand.\r\n\r\nThen the four knights went each one to other and comforted each other.\r\nWhat say ye by this guest? said Sir Gawaine, that one spear hath felled\r\nus all four. We commend him unto the devil, they said all, for he is a\r\nman of great might. Ye may well say it, said Sir Gawaine, that he is a\r\nman of might, for I dare lay my head it is Sir Launcelot, I know it by\r\nhis riding. Let him go, said Sir Gawaine, for when we come to the court\r\nthen shall we wit; and then had they much sorrow to get their horses\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Launcelot followed a brachet into a castle, where\r\nhe found a dead knight, and how he after was required of a damosel to\r\nheal her brother.\r\n\r\nNow leave we there and speak of Sir Launcelot that rode a great while\r\nin a deep forest, where he saw a black brachet, seeking in manner as it\r\nhad been in the feute of an hurt deer. And therewith he rode after the\r\nbrachet, and he saw lie on the ground a large feute of blood. And then\r\nSir Launcelot rode after. And ever the brachet looked behind her, and\r\nso she went through a great marsh, and ever Sir Launcelot followed. And\r\nthen was he ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so\r\nover the bridge. So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old\r\nand feeble; and when he came in midst of a great hall, there he saw lie\r\na dead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet licked his\r\nwounds. And therewithal came out a lady weeping and wringing her hands;\r\nand then she said, O knight, too much sorrow hast thou brought me. Why\r\nsay ye so? said Sir Launcelot, I did never this knight no harm, for\r\nhither by feute of blood this brachet brought me; and therefore, fair\r\nlady, be not displeased with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your\r\ngrievance. Truly, sir, she said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my\r\nhusband, for he that did that deed is sore wounded, and he is never\r\nlikely to recover, that shall I ensure him. What was your husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said she, his name was called Sir\r\nGilbert the Bastard, one of the best knights of the world, and he that\r\nhath slain him I know not his name. Now God send you better comfort,\r\nsaid Sir Launcelot; and so he departed and went into the forest again,\r\nand there he met with a damosel, the which knew him well, and she said\r\naloud, Well be ye found, my lord; and now I require thee, on thy\r\nknighthood, help my brother that is sore wounded, and never stinteth\r\nbleeding; for this day he fought with Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew\r\nhim in plain battle, and there was my brother sore wounded, and there\r\nis a lady a sorceress that dwelleth in a castle here beside, and this\r\nday she told me my brother\xe2\x80\x99s wounds should never be whole till I could\r\nfind a knight that would go into the Chapel Perilous, and there he\r\nshould find a sword and a bloody cloth that the wounded knight was\r\nlapped in, and a piece of that cloth and sword should heal my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwounds, so that his wounds were searched with the sword and the cloth.\r\nThis is a marvellous thing, said Sir Launcelot, but what is your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s name? Sir, she said, his name was Sir Meliot de Logres. That\r\nme repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he is a fellow of the Table\r\nRound, and to his help I will do my power. Then, sir, said she, follow\r\neven this highway, and it will bring you unto the Chapel Perilous; and\r\nhere I shall abide till God send you here again, and, but you speed, I\r\nknow no knight living that may achieve that adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat\r\nthere of a dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword.\r\n\r\nRight so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he came unto the Chapel\r\nPerilous he alighted down, and tied his horse unto a little gate. And\r\nas soon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the\r\nchapel many fair rich shields turned up-so-down, and many of the\r\nshields Sir Launcelot had seen knights bear beforehand. With that he\r\nsaw by him there stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any\r\nman that ever he had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir\r\nLauncelot. And when he saw their countenance he dreaded him sore, and\r\nso put his shield afore him, and took his sword ready in his hand ready\r\nunto battle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their\r\nshields and their swords drawn. And when Sir Launcelot would have gone\r\nthroughout them, they scattered on every side of him, and gave him the\r\nway, and therewith he waxed all bold, and entered into the chapel, and\r\nthen he saw no light but a dim lamp burning, and then was he ware of a\r\ncorpse hilled with a cloth of silk. Then Sir Launcelot stooped down,\r\nand cut a piece away of that cloth, and then it fared under him as the\r\nearth had quaked a little; therewithal he feared. And then he saw a\r\nfair sword lie by the dead knight, and that he gat in his hand and hied\r\nhim out of the chapel.\r\n\r\nAnon as ever he was in the chapel yard all the knights spake to him\r\nwith a grimly voice, and said, Knight, Sir Launcelot, lay that sword\r\nfrom thee or else thou shalt die. Whether that I live or die, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, with no great word get ye it again, therefore fight for it\r\nan ye list. Then right so he passed throughout them, and beyond the\r\nchapel yard there met him a fair damosel, and said, Sir Launcelot,\r\nleave that sword behind thee, or thou wilt die for it. I leave it not,\r\nsaid Sir Launcelot, for no treaties. No, said she, an thou didst leave\r\nthat sword, Queen Guenever should thou never see. Then were I a fool an\r\nI would leave this sword, said Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said the\r\ndamosel, I require thee to kiss me but once. Nay, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nthat God me forbid. Well, sir, said she, an thou hadst kissed me thy\r\nlife days had been done, but now, alas, she said, I have lost all my\r\nlabour, for I ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine.\r\nAnd once I had Sir Gawaine within me, and at that time he fought with\r\nthat knight that lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the\r\nBastard; and at that time he smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the\r\nBastard. And, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this\r\nseven year, but there may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever.\r\nBut sithen I may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no\r\nmore joy in this world but to have thy body dead. Then would I have\r\nbalmed it and served it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I\r\nshould have clipped thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen\r\nGuenever. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu preserve me from your\r\nsubtle crafts. And therewithal he took his horse and so departed from\r\nher. And as the book saith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she took\r\nsuch sorrow that she died within a fourteen night, and her name was\r\nHellawes the sorceress, Lady of the Castle Nigramous.\r\n\r\nAnon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot\xe2\x80\x99s sister. And when\r\nshe saw him she clapped her hands, and wept for joy. And then they rode\r\nunto a castle thereby where lay Sir Meliot. And anon as Sir Launcelot\r\nsaw him he knew him, but he was passing pale, as the earth, for\r\nbleeding. When Sir Meliot saw Sir Launcelot he kneeled upon his knees\r\nand cried on high: O lord Sir Launcelot, help me! Anon Sir Launcelot\r\nleapt unto him and touched his wounds with Sir Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s sword. And\r\nthen he wiped his wounds with a part of the bloody cloth that Sir\r\nGilbert was wrapped in, and anon an wholer man in his life was he\r\nnever. And then there was great joy between them, and they made Sir\r\nLauncelot all the cheer that they might, and so on the morn Sir\r\nLauncelot took his leave, and bade Sir Meliot hie him to the court of\r\nmy lord Arthur, for it draweth nigh to the Feast of Pentecost, and\r\nthere by the grace of God ye shall find me. And therewith they\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Launcelot at the request of a lady recovered a\r\nfalcon, by which he was deceived.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries, over marshes\r\nand valleys, till by fortune he came to a fair castle, and as he passed\r\nbeyond the castle him thought he heard two bells ring. And then was he\r\nware of a falcon came flying over his head toward an high elm, and long\r\nlunes about her feet, and as she flew unto the elm to take her perch\r\nthe lunes over-cast about a bough. And when she would have taken her\r\nflight she hung by the legs fast; and Sir Launcelot saw how she hung,\r\nand beheld the fair falcon perigot, and he was sorry for her.\r\n\r\nThe meanwhile came a lady out of the castle and cried on high: O\r\nLauncelot, Launcelot, as thou art flower of all knights, help me to get\r\nmy hawk, for an my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me; for I kept the\r\nhawk and she slipped from me, and if my lord my husband wit it he is so\r\nhasty that he will slay me. What is your lord\xe2\x80\x99s name? said Sir\r\nLauncelot. Sir, she said, his name is Sir Phelot, a knight that longeth\r\nunto the King of Northgalis. Well, fair lady, since that ye know my\r\nname, and require me of knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to\r\nget your hawk, and yet God knoweth I am an ill climber, and the tree is\r\npassing high, and few boughs to help me withal. And therewith Sir\r\nLauncelot alighted, and tied his horse to the same tree, and prayed the\r\nlady to unarm him. And so when he was unarmed, he put off all his\r\nclothes unto his shirt and breech, and with might and force he clomb up\r\nto the falcon, and tied the lines to a great rotten boyshe, and threw\r\nthe hawk down and it withal.\r\n\r\nAnon the lady gat the hawk in her hand; and therewithal came out Sir\r\nPhelot out of the groves suddenly, that was her husband, all armed and\r\nwith his naked sword in his hand, and said: O knight Launcelot, now\r\nhave I found thee as I would, and stood at the bole of the tree to slay\r\nhim. Ah, lady, said Sir Launcelot, why have ye betrayed me? She hath\r\ndone, said Sir Phelot, but as I commanded her, and therefore there nis\r\nnone other boot but thine hour is come that thou must die. That were\r\nshame unto thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou an armed knight to slay a\r\nnaked man by treason. Thou gettest none other grace, said Sir Phelot,\r\nand therefore help thyself an thou canst. Truly, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nthat shall be thy shame, but since thou wilt do none other, take mine\r\nharness with thee, and hang my sword upon a bough that I may get it,\r\nand then do thy best to slay me an thou canst. Nay, nay, said Sir\r\nPhelot, for I know thee better than thou weenest, therefore thou\r\ngettest no weapon, an I may keep you therefrom. Alas, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, that ever a knight should die weaponless. And therewith he\r\nwaited above him and under him, and over his head he saw a rownsepyk, a\r\nbig bough leafless, and therewith he brake it off by the body. And then\r\nhe came lower and awaited how his own horse stood, and suddenly he\r\nleapt on the further side of the horse, fro-ward the knight. And then\r\nSir Phelot lashed at him eagerly, weening to have slain him. But Sir\r\nLauncelot put away the stroke with the rownsepyk, and therewith he\r\nsmote him on the one side of the head, that he fell down in a swoon to\r\nthe ground. So then Sir Launcelot took his sword out of his hand, and\r\nstruck his neck from the body. Then cried the lady, Alas! why hast thou\r\nslain my husband? I am not causer, said Sir Launcelot, for with\r\nfalsehood ye would have had slain me with treason, and now it is fallen\r\non you both. And then she swooned as though she would die. And\r\ntherewithal Sir Launcelot gat all his armour as well as he might, and\r\nput it upon him for dread of more resort, for he dreaded that the\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s castle was so nigh. And so, as soon as he might, he took his\r\nhorse and departed, and thanked God that he had escaped that adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot overtook a knight which chased his wife\r\nto have slain her, and how he said to him.\r\n\r\nSo Sir Launcelot rode many wild ways, throughout marches and many wild\r\nways. And as he rode in a valley he saw a knight chasing a lady, with a\r\nnaked sword, to have slain her. And by fortune as this knight should\r\nhave slain this lady, she cried on Sir Launcelot and prayed him to\r\nrescue her. When Sir Launcelot saw that mischief, he took his horse and\r\nrode between them, saying, Knight, fie for shame, why wilt thou slay\r\nthis lady? thou dost shame unto thee and all knights. What hast thou to\r\ndo betwixt me and my wife? said the knight. I will slay her maugre thy\r\nhead. That shall ye not, said Sir Launcelot, for rather we two will\r\nhave ado together. Sir Launcelot, said the knight, thou dost not thy\r\npart, for this lady hath betrayed me. It is not so, said the lady,\r\ntruly he saith wrong on me. And for because I love and cherish my\r\ncousin germain, he is jealous betwixt him and me; and as I shall answer\r\nto God there was never sin betwixt us. But, sir, said the lady, as thou\r\nart called the worshipfullest knight of the world, I require thee of\r\ntrue knighthood, keep me and save me. For whatsomever ye say he will\r\nslay me, for he is without mercy. Have ye no doubt, said Launcelot, it\r\nshall not lie in his power. Sir, said the knight, in your sight I will\r\nbe ruled as ye will have me. And so Sir Launcelot rode on the one side\r\nand she on the other: he had not ridden but a while, but the knight\r\nbade Sir Launcelot turn him and look behind him, and said, Sir, yonder\r\ncome men of arms after us riding. And so Sir Launcelot turned him and\r\nthought no treason, and therewith was the knight and the lady on one\r\nside, and suddenly he swapped off his lady\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sir Launcelot had espied him what he had done, he said, and\r\ncalled him, Traitor, thou hast shamed me for ever. And suddenly Sir\r\nLauncelot alighted off his horse, and pulled out his sword to slay him,\r\nand therewithal he fell flat to the earth, and gripped Sir Launcelot by\r\nthe thighs, and cried mercy. Fie on thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou\r\nshameful knight, thou mayest have no mercy, and therefore arise and\r\nfight with me. Nay, said the knight, I will never arise till ye grant\r\nme mercy. Now will I proffer thee fair, said Launcelot, I will unarm me\r\nunto my shirt, and I will have nothing upon me but my shirt, and my\r\nsword and my hand. And if thou canst slay me, quit be thou for ever.\r\nNay, sir, said Pedivere, that will I never. Well, said Sir Launcelot,\r\ntake this lady and the head, and bear it upon thee, and here shalt thou\r\nswear upon my sword, to bear it always upon thy back, and never to rest\r\ntill thou come to Queen Guenever. Sir, said he, that will I do, by the\r\nfaith of my body. Now, said Launcelot, tell me what is your name? Sir,\r\nmy name is Pedivere. In a shameful hour wert thou born, said Launcelot.\r\n\r\nSo Pedivere departed with the dead lady and the head, and found the\r\nqueen with King Arthur at Winchester, and there he told all the truth.\r\nSir knight, said the queen, this is an horrible deed and a shameful,\r\nand a great rebuke unto Sir Launcelot; but notwithstanding his worship\r\nis not known in many divers countries; but this shall I give you in\r\npenance, make ye as good shift as ye can, ye shall bear this lady with\r\nyou on horseback unto the Pope of Rome, and of him receive your penance\r\nfor your foul deeds; and ye shall never rest one night whereas ye do\r\nanother; an ye go to any bed the dead body shall lie with you. This\r\noath there he made, and so departed. And as it telleth in the French\r\nbook, when he came to Rome, the Pope bade him go again unto Queen\r\nGuenever, and in Rome was his lady buried by the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s commandment.\r\nAnd after this Sir Pedivere fell to great goodness, and was an holy man\r\nand an hermit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s Court, and how\r\nthere were recounted all his noble feats and acts.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days afore\r\nthe Feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were passing\r\nfain of his coming. And when Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore,\r\nSir Ector de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay\xe2\x80\x99s armour, then they wist\r\nwell it was he that smote them down all with one spear. Then there was\r\nlaughing and smiling among them. And ever now and now came all the\r\nknights home that Sir Turquine had prisoners, and they all honoured and\r\nworshipped Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he said, I saw all the battle from\r\nthe beginning to the ending, and there he told King Arthur all how it\r\nwas, and how Sir Turquine was the strongest knight that ever he saw\r\nexcept Sir Launcelot: there were many knights bare him record, nigh\r\nthree score. Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued\r\nhim when he should have been slain, and how he made the knights yield\r\nthem to me, and not to him. And there they were all three, and bare\r\nrecord. And by Jesu, said Sir Kay, because Sir Launcelot took my\r\nharness and left me his I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nAnon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with Sir\r\nLauncelot at the long bridge. And there they yielded them unto Sir Kay,\r\nand Sir Kay forsook them and said he fought never with them. But I\r\nshall ease your heart, said Sir Kay, yonder is Sir Launcelot that\r\novercame you. When they wist that they were glad. And then Sir Meliot\r\nde Logres came home, and told the king how Sir Launcelot had saved him\r\nfrom the death. And all his deeds were known, how four queens,\r\nsorceresses, had him in prison, and how he was delivered by King\r\nBagdemagus\xe2\x80\x99 daughter. Also there were told all the great deeds of arms\r\nthat Sir Launcelot did betwixt the two kings, that is for to say the\r\nKing of Northgalis and King Bagdemagus. All the truth Sir Gahalantine\r\ndid tell, and Sir Mador de la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they were at\r\nthat same tournament. Then came in the lady that knew Sir Launcelot\r\nwhen that he wounded Sir Belleus at the pavilion. And there, at request\r\nof Sir Launcelot, Sir Belleus was made knight of the Round Table. And\r\nso at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight of\r\nthe world, and most he was honoured of high and low.\r\n\r\n Explicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake, which is the vi.\r\n book. Here followeth the tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that was called\r\n Beaumains by Sir Kay, and is the seventh book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How Beaumains came to King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s Court and demanded three\r\npetitions of King Arthur.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur held his Round Table most plenour, it fortuned that he\r\ncommanded that the high feast of Pentecost should be holden at a city\r\nand a castle, the which in those days was called Kynke Kenadonne, upon\r\nthe sands that marched nigh Wales. So ever the king had a custom that\r\nat the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year,\r\nhe would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great\r\nmarvel. And for that custom all manner of strange adventures came\r\nbefore Arthur as at that feast before all other feasts. And so Sir\r\nGawaine, a little to-fore noon of the day of Pentecost, espied at a\r\nwindow three men upon horseback, and a dwarf on foot, and so the three\r\nmen alighted, and the dwarf kept their horses, and one of the three men\r\nwas higher than the other twain by a foot and an half. Then Sir Gawaine\r\nwent unto the king and said, Sir, go to your meat, for here at the hand\r\ncome strange adventures. So Arthur went unto his meat with many other\r\nkings. And there were all the knights of the Round Table, [save] only\r\nthose that were prisoners or slain at a recounter. Then at the high\r\nfeast evermore they should be fulfilled the whole number of an hundred\r\nand fifty, for then was the Round Table fully complished.\r\n\r\nRight so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly, and upon\r\ntheir shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest\r\nthat ever they all saw, and he was large and long, and broad in the\r\nshoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest handed\r\nthat ever man saw, but he fared as though he might not go nor bear\r\nhimself but if he leaned upon their shoulders. Anon as Arthur saw him\r\nthere was made peace and room, and right so they yede with him unto the\r\nhigh dais, without saying of any words. Then this much young man pulled\r\nhim aback, and easily stretched up straight, saying, King Arthur, God\r\nyou bless and all your fair fellowship, and in especial the fellowship\r\nof the Table Round. And for this cause I am come hither, to pray you\r\nand require you to give me three gifts, and they shall not be\r\nunreasonably asked, but that ye may worshipfully and honourably grant\r\nthem me, and to you no great hurt nor loss. And the first don and gift\r\nI will ask now, and the other two gifts I will ask this day\r\ntwelvemonth, wheresomever ye hold your high feast. Now ask, said\r\nArthur, and ye shall have your asking.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, this is my petition for this feast, that ye will give me meat\r\nand drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will ask\r\nmine other two gifts.\r\n\r\nMy fair son, said Arthur, ask better, I counsel thee, for this is but a\r\nsimple asking; for my heart giveth me to thee greatly, that thou art\r\ncome of men of worship, and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou\r\nshalt prove a man of right great worship. Sir, he said, thereof be as\r\nit be may, I have asked that I will ask. Well, said the king, ye shall\r\nhave meat and drink enough; I never defended that none, neither my\r\nfriend nor my foe. But what is thy name I would wit? I cannot tell you,\r\nsaid he. That is marvel, said the king, that thou knowest not thy name,\r\nand thou art the goodliest young man that ever I saw. Then the king\r\nbetook him to Sir Kay the steward, and charged him that he should give\r\nhim of all manner of meats and drinks of the best, and also that he had\r\nall manner of finding as though he were a lord\xe2\x80\x99s son. That shall little\r\nneed, said Sir Kay, to do such cost upon him; for I dare undertake he\r\nis a villain born, and never will make man, for an he had come of\r\ngentlemen he would have asked of you horse and armour, but such as he\r\nis, so he asketh. And sithen he hath no name, I shall give him a name\r\nthat shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands, and into the kitchen I\r\nshall bring him, and there he shall have fat brose every day, that he\r\nshall be as fat by the twelvemonths\xe2\x80\x99 end as a pork hog. Right so the\r\ntwo men departed and beleft him to Sir Kay, that scorned him and mocked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth because Sir\r\nKay mocked Beaumains, and of a damosel which desired a knight to fight\r\nfor a lady.\r\n\r\nThereat was Sir Gawaine wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bade Sir\r\nKay leave his mocking, for I dare lay my head he shall prove a man of\r\ngreat worship. Let be said Sir Kay, it may not be by no reason, for as\r\nhe is, so he hath asked. Beware, said Sir Launcelot, so ye gave the\r\ngood knight Brewnor, Sir Dinadan\xe2\x80\x99s brother, a name, and ye called him\r\nLa Cote Male Taile, and that turned you to anger afterward. As for\r\nthat, said Sir Kay, this shall never prove none such. For Sir Brewnor\r\ndesired ever worship, and this desireth bread and drink and broth; upon\r\npain of my life he was fostered up in some abbey, and, howsomever it\r\nwas, they failed meat and drink, and so hither he is come for his\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Kay bade get him a place, and sit down to meat; so Beaumains\r\nwent to the hall door, and set him down among boys and lads, and there\r\nhe ate sadly. And then Sir Launcelot after meat bade him come to his\r\nchamber, and there he should have meat and drink enough. And so did Sir\r\nGawaine: but he refused them all; he would do none other but as Sir Kay\r\ncommanded him, for no proffer. But as touching Sir Gawaine, he had\r\nreason to proffer him lodging, meat, and drink, for that proffer came\r\nof his blood, for he was nearer kin to him than he wist. But that as\r\nSir Launcelot did was of his great gentleness and courtesy.\r\n\r\nSo thus he was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys of the\r\nkitchen did. And so he endured all that twelvemonth, and never\r\ndispleased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But ever\r\nwhen that he saw any jousting of knights, that would he see an he\r\nmight. And ever Sir Launcelot would give him gold to spend, and\r\nclothes, and so did Sir Gawaine, and where there were any masteries\r\ndone, thereat would he be, and there might none cast bar nor stone to\r\nhim by two yards. Then would Sir Kay say, How liketh you my boy of the\r\nkitchen? So it passed on till the feast of Whitsuntide. And at that\r\ntime the king held it at Carlion in the most royallest wise that might\r\nbe, like as he did yearly. But the king would no meat eat upon the\r\nWhitsunday, until he heard some adventures. Then came there a squire to\r\nthe king and said, Sir, ye may go to your meat, for here cometh a\r\ndamosel with some strange adventures. Then was the king glad and sat\r\nhim down.\r\n\r\nRight so there came a damosel into the hall and saluted the king, and\r\nprayed him of succour. For whom? said the king, what is the adventure?\r\n\r\nSir, she said, I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she is\r\nbesieged with a tyrant, so that she may not out of her castle; and\r\nbecause here are called the noblest knights of the world, I come to you\r\nto pray you of succour. What hight your lady, and where dwelleth she,\r\nand who is she, and what is his name that hath besieged her? Sir king,\r\nshe said, as for my lady\xe2\x80\x99s name that shall not ye know for me as at\r\nthis time, but I let you wit she is a lady of great worship and of\r\ngreat lands; and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth\r\nher lands, he is called the Red Knight of the Red Launds. I know him\r\nnot, said the king. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I know him well, for he is\r\none of the perilloust knights of the world; men say that he hath seven\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s strength, and from him I escaped once full hard with my life.\r\nFair damosel, said the king, there be knights here would do their power\r\nfor to rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her name, nor\r\nwhere she dwelleth, therefore none of my knights that here be now shall\r\ngo with you by my will. Then must I speak further, said the damosel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How Beaumains desired the battle, and how it was granted\r\nto him, and how he desired to be made knight of Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nWith these words came before the king Beaumains, while the damosel was\r\nthere, and thus he said, Sir king, God thank you, I have been this\r\ntwelvemonth in your kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and now I\r\nwill ask my two gifts that be behind. Ask, upon my peril, said the\r\nking. Sir, this shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me to\r\nhave this adventure of the damosel, for it belongeth unto me. Thou\r\nshalt have it, said the king, I grant it thee. Then, sir, this is the\r\nother gift, that ye shall bid Launcelot du Lake to make me knight, for\r\nof him I will be made knight and else of none. And when I am passed I\r\npray you let him ride after me, and make me knight when I require him.\r\nAll this shall be done, said the king. Fie on thee, said the damosel,\r\nshall I have none but one that is your kitchen page? Then was she wroth\r\nand took her horse and departed. And with that there came one to\r\nBeaumains and told him his horse and armour was come for him; and there\r\nwas the dwarf come with all thing that him needed, in the richest\r\nmanner; thereat all the court had much marvel from whence came all that\r\ngear. So when he was armed there was none but few so goodly a man as he\r\nwas; and right so as he came into the hall and took his leave of King\r\nArthur, and Sir Gawaine, and Sir Launcelot, and prayed that he would\r\nhie after him, and so departed and rode after the damosel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How Beaumains departed, and how he gat of Sir Kay a spear\r\nand a shield, and how he jousted with Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nBut there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and trapped\r\nin cloth of gold, but he had neither shield nor spear. Then Sir Kay\r\nsaid all open in the hall, I will ride after my boy in the kitchen, to\r\nwit whether he will know me for his better. Said Sir Launcelot and Sir\r\nGawaine, Yet abide at home. So Sir Kay made him ready and took his\r\nhorse and his spear, and rode after him. And right as Beaumains\r\novertook the damosel, right so came Sir Kay and said, Beaumains, what,\r\nsir, know ye not me? Then he turned his horse, and knew it was Sir Kay,\r\nthat had done him all the despite as ye have heard afore. Yea, said\r\nBeaumains, I know you for an ungentle knight of the court, and\r\ntherefore beware of me. Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest,\r\nand ran straight upon him; and Beaumains came as fast upon him with his\r\nsword in his hand, and so he put away his spear with his sword, and\r\nwith a foin thrust him through the side, that Sir Kay fell down as he\r\nhad been dead; and he alighted down and took Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s shield and his\r\nspear, and stert upon his own horse and rode his way.\r\n\r\nAll that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel. And then he bade\r\nhis dwarf stert upon Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and so he did. By that Sir\r\nLauncelot was come, then he proffered Sir Launcelot to joust; and\r\neither made them ready, and they came together so fiercely that either\r\nbare down other to the earth, and sore were they bruised. Then Sir\r\nLauncelot arose and helped him from his horse. And then Beaumains threw\r\nhis shield from him, and proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot;\r\nand so they rushed together like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to\r\nthe mountenance of an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him so big that he\r\nmarvelled of his strength, for he fought more liker a giant than a\r\nknight, and that his fighting was durable and passing perilous. For Sir\r\nLauncelot had so much ado with him that he dreaded himself to be\r\nshamed, and said, Beaumains, fight not so sore, your quarrel and mine\r\nis not so great but we may leave off. Truly that is truth, said\r\nBeaumains, but it doth me good to feel your might, and yet, my lord, I\r\nshowed not the utterance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How Beaumains told to Sir Launcelot his name, and how he was\r\ndubbed knight of Sir Launcelot, and after overtook the damosel.\r\n\r\nIn God\xe2\x80\x99s name, said Sir Launcelot, for I promise you, by the faith of\r\nmy body, I had as much to do as I might to save myself from you\r\nunshamed, and therefore have ye no doubt of none earthly knight. Hope\r\nye so that I may any while stand a proved knight? said Beaumains. Yea,\r\nsaid Launcelot, do as ye have done, and I shall be your warrant. Then,\r\nI pray you, said Beaumains, give me the order of knighthood. Then must\r\nye tell me your name, said Launcelot, and of what kin ye be born. Sir,\r\nso that ye will not discover me I shall, said Beaumains. Nay, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, and that I promise you by the faith of my body, until it be\r\nopenly known. Then, sir, he said, my name is Gareth, and brother unto\r\nSir Gawaine of father and mother. Ah, sir, said Sir Launcelot, I am\r\nmore gladder of you than I was; for ever me thought ye should be of\r\ngreat blood, and that ye came not to the court neither for meat nor for\r\ndrink. And then Sir Launcelot gave him the order of knighthood, and\r\nthen Sir Gareth prayed him for to depart and let him go.\r\n\r\nSo Sir Launcelot departed from him and came to Sir Kay, and made him to\r\nbe borne home upon his shield, and so he was healed hard with the life;\r\nand all men scorned Sir Kay, and in especial Sir Gawaine and Sir\r\nLauncelot said it was not his part to rebuke no young man, for full\r\nlittle knew he of what birth he is come, and for what cause he came to\r\nthis court; and so we leave Sir Kay and turn we unto Beaumains.\r\n\r\nWhen he had overtaken the damosel, anon she said, What dost thou here?\r\nthou stinkest all of the kitchen, thy clothes be bawdy of the grease\r\nand tallow that thou gainest in King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen; weenest thou,\r\nsaid she, that I allow thee, for yonder knight that thou killest. Nay\r\ntruly, for thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly; therefore turn\r\nagain, bawdy kitchen page, I know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee\r\nBeaumains. What art thou but a lusk and a turner of broaches and a\r\nladle-washer? Damosel, said Beaumains, say to me what ye will, I will\r\nnot go from you whatsomever ye say, for I have undertaken to King\r\nArthur for to achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish it to the\r\nend, either I shall die therefore. Fie on thee, kitchen knave, wilt\r\nthou finish mine adventure? thou shalt anon be met withal, that thou\r\nwouldest not for all the broth that ever thou suppest once look him in\r\nthe face. I shall assay, said Beaumains.\r\n\r\nSo thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all that ever\r\nhe might. Whither wilt thou? said Beaumains. O lord, he said, help me,\r\nfor here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and\r\nbound him, so I am afeard lest they will slay him. Bring me thither,\r\nsaid Beaumains. And so they rode together until they came thereas was\r\nthe knight bounden; and then he rode unto them, and struck one unto the\r\ndeath, and then another, and at the third stroke he slew the third\r\nthief, and then the other three fled. And he rode after them, and he\r\novertook them; and then those three thieves turned again and assailed\r\nBeaumains hard, but at the last he slew them, and returned and unbound\r\nthe knight. And the knight thanked him, and prayed him to ride with him\r\nto his castle there a little beside, and he should worshipfully reward\r\nhim for his good deeds. Sir, said Beaumains, I will no reward have: I\r\nwas this day made knight of noble Sir Launcelot, and therefore I will\r\nno reward have, but God reward me. And also I must follow this damosel.\r\n\r\nAnd when he came nigh her she bade him ride from her, For thou smellest\r\nall of the kitchen: weenest thou that I have joy of thee, for all this\r\ndeed that thou hast done is but mishapped thee: but thou shalt see a\r\nsight shall make thee turn again, and that lightly. Then the same\r\nknight which was rescued of the thieves rode after that damosel, and\r\nprayed her to lodge with him all that night. And because it was near\r\nnight the damosel rode with him to his castle, and there they had great\r\ncheer, and at supper the knight sat Sir Beaumains afore the damosel.\r\nFie, fie, said she, Sir knight, ye are uncourteous to set a kitchen\r\npage afore me; him beseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit afore\r\na damosel of high parage. Then the knight was ashamed at her words, and\r\ntook him up, and set him at a sideboard, and set himself afore him, and\r\nso all that night they had good cheer and merry rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How Beaumains fought and slew two knights at a passage.\r\n\r\nAnd on the morn the damosel and he took their leave and thanked the\r\nknight, and so departed, and rode on their way until they came to a\r\ngreat forest. And there was a great river and but one passage, and\r\nthere were ready two knights on the farther side to let them the\r\npassage. What sayest thou, said the damosel, wilt thou match yonder\r\nknights or turn again? Nay, said Sir Beaumains, I will not turn again\r\nan they were six more. And therewithal he rushed into the water, and in\r\nmidst of the water either brake their spears upon other to their hands,\r\nand then they drew their swords, and smote eagerly at other. And at the\r\nlast Sir Beaumains smote the other upon the helm that his head stonied,\r\nand therewithal he fell down in the water, and there was he drowned.\r\nAnd then he spurred his horse upon the land, where the other knight\r\nfell upon him, and brake his spear, and so they drew their swords and\r\nfought long together. At the last Sir Beaumains clave his helm and his\r\nhead down to the shoulders; and so he rode unto the damosel and bade\r\nher ride forth on her way.\r\n\r\nAlas, she said, that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to\r\ndestroy such two doughty knights: thou weenest thou hast done\r\ndoughtily, that is not so; for the first knight his horse stumbled, and\r\nthere he was drowned in the water, and never it was by thy force, nor\r\nby thy might. And the last knight by mishap thou camest behind him and\r\nmishappily thou slew him.\r\n\r\nDamosel, said Beaumains, ye may say what ye will, but with whomsomever\r\nI have ado withal, I trust to God to serve him or he depart. And\r\ntherefore I reck not what ye say, so that I may win your lady. Fie,\r\nfie, foul kitchen knave, thou shalt see knights that shall abate thy\r\nboast. Fair damosel, give me goodly language, and then my care is past,\r\nfor what knights somever they be, I care not, nor I doubt them not.\r\nAlso, said she, I say it for thine avail, yet mayest thou turn again\r\nwith thy worship; for an thou follow me, thou art but slain, for I see\r\nall that ever thou dost is but by misadventure, and not by prowess of\r\nthy hands. Well, damosel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresomever ye\r\ngo I will follow you. So this Beaumains rode with that lady till\r\nevensong time, and ever she chid him, and would not rest. And they came\r\nto a black laund; and there was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a\r\nblack banner, and on the other side there hung a black shield, and by\r\nit stood a black spear great and long, and a great black horse covered\r\nwith silk, and a black stone fast by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How Beaumains fought with the Knight of the Black Launds,\r\nand fought with him till he fell down and died.\r\n\r\nThere sat a knight all armed in black harness, and his name was the\r\nKnight of the Black Laund. Then the damosel, when she saw that knight,\r\nshe bade him flee down that valley, for his horse was not saddled.\r\nGramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward. With\r\nthat the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said, Damosel,\r\nhave ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion? Nay,\r\nfair knight, said she, this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen for alms. Why cometh he, said the knight, in such\r\narray? it is shame that he beareth you company. Sir, I cannot be\r\ndelivered of him, said she, for with me he rideth maugre mine head: God\r\nwould that ye should put him from me, other to slay him an ye may, for\r\nhe is an unhappy knave, and unhappily he hath done this day: through\r\nmishap I saw him slay two knights at the passage of the water; and\r\nother deeds he did before right marvellous and through unhappiness.\r\nThat marvelleth me, said the Black Knight, that any man that is of\r\nworship will have ado with him. They know him not, said the damosel,\r\nand for because he rideth with me, they ween that he be some man of\r\nworship born. That may be, said the Black Knight; howbeit as ye say\r\nthat he be no man of worship, he is a full likely person, and full like\r\nto be a strong man: but thus much shall I grant you, said the Black\r\nKnight; I shall put him down upon one foot, and his horse and his\r\nharness he shall leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any\r\nmore harm.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, Sir knight, thou art\r\nfull large of my horse and my harness; I let thee wit it cost thee\r\nnought, and whether it liketh thee or not, this laund will I pass\r\nmaugre thine head. And horse nor harness gettest thou none of mine, but\r\nif thou win them with thy hands; and therefore let see what thou canst\r\ndo. Sayest thou that? said the Black Knight, now yield thy lady from\r\nthee, for it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a lady.\r\nThou liest, said Beaumains, I am a gentleman born, and of more high\r\nlineage than thou, and that will I prove on thy body.\r\n\r\nThen in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came together\r\nas it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight\xe2\x80\x99s spear brake, and\r\nBeaumains thrust him through both his sides, and therewith his spear\r\nbrake, and the truncheon left still in his side. But nevertheless the\r\nBlack Knight drew his sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great\r\nmight, and hurt Beaumains full sore. But at the last the Black Knight,\r\nwithin an hour and an half, he fell down off his horse in swoon, and\r\nthere he died. And when Beaumains saw him so well horsed and armed,\r\nthen he alighted down and armed him in his armour, and so took his\r\nhorse and rode after the damosel.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw him come nigh, she said, Away, kitchen knave, out of the\r\nwind, for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me. Alas, she said,\r\nthat ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou\r\nhast done, but all this is thine unhappiness. But here by is one shall\r\npay thee all thy payment, and therefore yet I counsel thee, flee. It\r\nmay happen me, said Beaumains, to be beaten or slain, but I warn you,\r\nfair damosel, I will not flee away, a nor leave your company, for all\r\nthat ye can say; for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat me, but\r\nhowsomever it happeneth I escape, and they lie on the ground. And\r\ntherefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all day\r\nrebuking me, for away will I not till I see the uttermost of this\r\njourney, or else I will be slain, other truly beaten; therefore ride on\r\nyour way, for follow you I will whatsomever happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How the brother of the knight that was slain met with\r\nBeaumains, and fought with Beaumains till he was yielden.\r\n\r\nThus as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by them all\r\nin green, both his horse and his harness; and when he came nigh the\r\ndamosel, he asked her, Is that my brother the Black Knight that ye have\r\nbrought with you? Nay, nay, she said, this unhappy kitchen knave hath\r\nslain your brother through unhappiness. Alas, said the Green Knight,\r\nthat is great pity, that so noble a knight as he was should so\r\nunhappily be slain, and namely of a knave\xe2\x80\x99s hand, as ye say that he is.\r\nAh! traitor, said the Green Knight, thou shalt die for slaying of my\r\nbrother; he was a full noble knight, and his name was Sir Perard. I\r\ndefy thee, said Beaumains, for I let thee wit I slew him knightly and\r\nnot shamefully.\r\n\r\nTherewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green, and it\r\nhung upon a thorn, and there he blew three deadly motes, and there came\r\ntwo damosels and armed him lightly. And then he took a great horse, and\r\na green shield and a green spear. And then they ran together with all\r\ntheir mights, and brake their spears unto their hands. And then they\r\ndrew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and either of them\r\nwounded other full ill. And at the last, at an overthwart, Beaumains\r\nwith his horse struck the Green Knight\xe2\x80\x99s horse upon the side, that he\r\nfell to the earth. And then the Green Knight avoided his horse lightly,\r\nand dressed him upon foot. That saw Beaumains, and therewithal he\r\nalighted, and they rushed together like two mighty kemps a long while,\r\nand sore they bled both. With that came the damosel, and said, My lord\r\nthe Green Knight, why for shame stand ye so long fighting with the\r\nkitchen knave? Alas, it is shame that ever ye were made knight, to see\r\nsuch a lad to match such a knight, as the weed overgrew the corn.\r\nTherewith the Green Knight was ashamed, and therewithal he gave a great\r\nstroke of might, and clave his shield through. When Beaumains saw his\r\nshield cloven asunder he was a little ashamed of that stroke and of her\r\nlanguage; and then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell\r\non his knees. And so suddenly Beaumains pulled him upon the ground\r\ngrovelling. And then the Green Knight cried him mercy, and yielded him\r\nunto Sir Beaumains, and prayed him to slay him not. All is in vain,\r\nsaid Beaumains, for thou shalt die but if this damosel that came with\r\nme pray me to save thy life. And therewithal he unlaced his helm like\r\nas he would slay him. Fie upon thee, false kitchen page, I will never\r\npray thee to save his life, for I will never be so much in thy danger.\r\nThen shall he die, said Beaumains. Not so hardy, thou bawdy knave, said\r\nthe damosel, that thou slay him. Alas, said the Green Knight, suffer me\r\nnot to die for a fair word may save me. Fair knight, said the Green\r\nKnight, save my life, and I will forgive thee the death of my brother,\r\nand for ever to become thy man, and thirty knights that hold of me for\r\never shall do you service. In the devil\xe2\x80\x99s name, said the damosel, that\r\nsuch a bawdy kitchen knave should have thee and thirty knights\xe2\x80\x99\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSir knight, said Beaumains, all this availeth thee not, but if my\r\ndamosel speak with me for thy life. And therewithal he made a semblant\r\nto slay him. Let be, said the damosel, thou bawdy knave; slay him not,\r\nfor an thou do thou shalt repent it. Damosel, said Beaumains, your\r\ncharge is to me a pleasure, and at your commandment his life shall be\r\nsaved, and else not. Then he said, Sir knight with the green arms, I\r\nrelease thee quit at this damosel\xe2\x80\x99s request, for I will not make her\r\nwroth, I will fulfil all that she chargeth me. And then the Green\r\nKnight kneeled down, and did him homage with his sword. Then said the\r\ndamosel, Me repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage, and of your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s death, the Black Knight, for of your help I had great mister,\r\nfor I dread me sore to pass this forest. Nay, dread you not, said the\r\nGreen Knight, for ye shall lodge with me this night, and to-morn I\r\nshall help you through this forest. So they took their horses and rode\r\nto his manor, which was fast there beside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not\r\nsuffer him to sit at her table, but called him kitchen boy.\r\n\r\nAnd ever she rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him to sit at her\r\ntable, but as the Green Knight took him and sat him at a side table.\r\nMarvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the damosel, why ye rebuke\r\nthis noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damosel, he is a full noble\r\nknight, and I know no knight is able to match him; therefore ye do\r\ngreat wrong to rebuke him, for he shall do you right good service, for\r\nwhatsomever he maketh himself, ye shall prove at the end that he is\r\ncome of a noble blood and of king\xe2\x80\x99s lineage. Fie, fie, said the\r\ndamosel, it is shame for you to say of him such worship. Truly, said\r\nthe Green Knight, it were shame for me to say of him any disworship,\r\nfor he hath proved himself a better knight than I am, yet have I met\r\nwith many knights in my days, and never or this time have I found no\r\nknight his match. And so that night they yede unto rest, and all that\r\nnight the Green Knight commanded thirty knights privily to watch\r\nBeaumains, for to keep him from all treason.\r\n\r\nAnd so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake their\r\nfast; and then they took their horses and rode on their way, and the\r\nGreen Knight conveyed them through the forest; and there the Green\r\nKnight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these thirty knights shall be\r\nalways at your summons, both early and late, at your calling and\r\nwhither that ever ye will send us. It is well said, said Beaumains;\r\nwhen that I call upon you ye must yield you unto King Arthur, and all\r\nyour knights. If that ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times,\r\nsaid the Green Knight. Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s name, said\r\nthe damosel, that any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen\r\nknave. So then departed the Green Knight and the damosel. And then she\r\nsaid unto Beaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen boy? Cast away\r\nthy shield and thy spear, and flee away; yet I counsel thee betimes or\r\nthou shalt say right soon, alas; for wert thou as wight as ever was\r\nWade or Launcelot, Tristram, or the good knight Sir Lamorak, thou shalt\r\nnot pass a pass here that is called the Pass Perilous. Damosel, said\r\nBeaumains, who is afeard let him flee, for it were shame to turn again\r\nsithen I have ridden so long with you. Well, said the damosel, ye shall\r\nsoon, whether ye will or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How the third brother, called the Red Knight, jousted and\r\nfought against Beaumains, and how Beaumains overcame him.\r\n\r\nSo within a while they saw a tower as white as any snow, well\r\nmatchecold all about, and double dyked. And over the tower gate there\r\nhung a fifty shields of divers colours, and under that tower there was\r\na fair meadow. And therein were many knights and squires to behold,\r\nscaffolds and pavilions; for there upon the morn should be a great\r\ntournament: and the lord of the tower was in his castle and looked out\r\nat a window, and saw a damosel, a dwarf, and a knight armed at all\r\npoints. So God me help, said the lord, with that knight will I joust,\r\nfor I see that he is a knight-errant. And so he armed him and horsed\r\nhim hastily. And when he was on horseback with his shield and his\r\nspear, it was all red, both his horse and his harness, and all that to\r\nhim longeth. And when that he came nigh him he weened it had been his\r\nbrother the Black Knight; and then he cried aloud, Brother, what do ye\r\nin these marches? Nay, nay, said the damosel, it is not he; this is but\r\na kitchen knave that was brought up for alms in King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\nNevertheless, said the Red Knight, I will speak with him or he depart.\r\nAh, said the damosel, this knave hath killed thy brother, and Sir Kay\r\nnamed him Beaumains, and this horse and this harness was thy brother\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthe Black Knight. Also I saw thy brother the Green Knight overcome of\r\nhis hands. Now may ye be revenged upon him, for I may never be quit of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith this either knights departed in sunder, and they came together\r\nwith all their might, and either of their horses fell to the earth, and\r\nthey avoided their horses, and put their shields afore them and drew\r\ntheir swords, and either gave other sad strokes, now here, now there,\r\nrasing, tracing, foining, and hurling like two boars, the space of two\r\nhours. And then she cried on high to the Red Knight, Alas, thou noble\r\nRed Knight, think what worship hath followed thee, let never a kitchen\r\nknave endure thee so long as he doth. Then the Red Knight waxed wroth\r\nand doubled his strokes, and hurt Beaumains wonderly sore, that the\r\nblood ran down to the ground, that it was wonder to see that strong\r\nbattle. Yet at the last Sir Beaumains struck him to the earth, and as\r\nhe would have slain the Red Knight, he cried mercy, saying, Noble\r\nknight, slay me not, and I shall yield me to thee with fifty knights\r\nwith me that be at my commandment. And I forgive thee all the despite\r\nthat thou hast done to me, and the death of my brother the Black\r\nKnight. All this availeth not, said Beaumains, but if my damosel pray\r\nme to save thy life. And therewith he made semblant to strike off his\r\nhead. Let be, thou Beaumains, slay him not, for he is a noble knight,\r\nand not so hardy, upon thine head, but thou save him.\r\n\r\nThen Beaumains bade the Red Knight, Stand up, and thank the damosel now\r\nof thy life. Then the Red Knight prayed him to see his castle, and to\r\nbe there all night. So the damosel then granted him, and there they had\r\nmerry cheer. But always the damosel spake many foul words unto\r\nBeaumains, whereof the Red Knight had great marvel; and all that night\r\nthe Red Knight made three score knights to watch Beaumains, that he\r\nshould have no shame nor villainy. And upon the morn they heard mass\r\nand dined, and the Red Knight came before Beaumains with his three\r\nscore knights, and there he proffered him his homage and fealty at all\r\ntimes, he and his knights to do him service. I thank you, said\r\nBeaumains, but this ye shall grant me: when I call upon you, to come\r\nafore my lord King Arthur, and yield you unto him to be his knights.\r\nSir, said the Red Knight, I will be ready, and my fellowship, at your\r\nsummons. So Sir Beaumains departed and the damosel, and ever she rode\r\nchiding him in the foulest manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel,\r\nand he suffered it patiently.\r\n\r\nDamosel, said Beaumains, ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye do,\r\nfor meseemeth I have done you good service, and ever ye threaten me I\r\nshall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever for all your boast\r\nthey lie in the dust or in the mire, and therefore I pray you rebuke me\r\nno more; and when ye see me beaten or yielden as recreant, then may ye\r\nbid me go from you shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not\r\ndepart from you, for I were worse than a fool an I would depart from\r\nyou all the while that I win worship. Well, said she, right soon there\r\nshall meet a knight shall pay thee all thy wages, for he is the most\r\nman of worship of the world, except King Arthur. I will well, said\r\nBeaumains, the more he is of worship, the more shall be my worship to\r\nhave ado with him.\r\n\r\nThen anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and fair. And\r\nbetwixt them and the city a mile and an half there was a fair meadow\r\nthat seemed new mown, and therein were many pavilions fair to behold.\r\nLo, said the damosel, yonder is a lord that owneth yonder city, and his\r\ncustom is, when the weather is fair, to lie in this meadow to joust and\r\ntourney. And ever there be about him five hundred knights and gentlemen\r\nof arms, and there be all manner of games that any gentleman can\r\ndevise. That goodly lord, said Beaumains, would I fain see. Thou shalt\r\nsee him time enough, said the damosel, and so as she rode near she\r\nespied the pavilion where he was. Lo, said she, seest thou yonder\r\npavilion that is all of the colour of Inde, and all manner of thing\r\nthat there is about, men and women, and horses trapped, shields and\r\nspears were all of the colour of Inde, and his name is Sir Persant of\r\nInde, the most lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst on. It may well\r\nbe, said Beaumains, but be he never so stout a knight, in this field I\r\nshall abide till that I see him under his shield. Ah, fool, said she,\r\nthou wert better flee betimes. Why, said Beaumains, an he be such a\r\nknight as ye make him, he will not set upon me with all his men, or\r\nwith his five hundred knights. For an there come no more but one at\r\nonce, I shall him not fail whilst my life lasteth. Fie, fie, said the\r\ndamosel, that ever such a stinking knave should blow such a boast.\r\nDamosel, he said, ye are to blame so to rebuke me, for I had liefer do\r\nfive battles than so to be rebuked, let him come and then let him do\r\nhis worst.\r\n\r\nSir, she said, I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art come;\r\nboldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen;\r\ntherefore I pray thee save thyself an thou mayest, for thy horse and\r\nthou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell over long from the\r\nsiege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all perilous passages we are\r\npassed save all only this passage; and here I dread me sore lest ye\r\nshall catch some hurt, therefore I would ye were hence, that ye were\r\nnot bruised nor hurt with this strong knight. But I let you wit that\r\nSir Persant of Inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the knight\r\nthat laid the siege about my lady. As for that, said Sir Beaumains, be\r\nit as it be may. For sithen I am come so nigh this knight I will prove\r\nhis might or I depart from him, and else I shall be shamed an I now\r\nwithdraw me from him. And therefore, damosel, have ye no doubt by the\r\ngrace of God I shall so deal with this knight that within two hours\r\nafter noon I shall deliver him. And then shall we come to the siege by\r\ndaylight. O Jesu, marvel have I, said the damosel, what manner a man ye\r\nbe, for it may never be otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood,\r\nfor so foul nor shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done\r\nyou, and ever courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but\r\nof a gentle blood.\r\n\r\nDamosel, said Beaumains, a knight may little do that may not suffer a\r\ndamosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none heed to your\r\nwords, for the more ye said the more ye angered me, and my wrath I\r\nwreaked upon them that I had ado withal. And therefore all the\r\nmissaying that ye missaid me furthered me in my battle, and caused me\r\nto think to show and prove myself at the end what I was; for\r\nperadventure though I had meat in King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen, yet I might\r\nhave had meat enough in other places, but all that I did it for to\r\nprove and assay my friends, and that shall be known another day; and\r\nwhether that I be a gentleman born or none, I let you wit, fair\r\ndamosel, I have done you gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s service, and peradventure better\r\nservice yet will I do or I depart from you. Alas, she said, fair\r\nBeaumains, forgive me all that I have missaid or done against thee.\r\nWith all my heart, said he, I forgive it you, for ye did nothing but as\r\nye should do, for all your evil words pleased me; and damosel, said\r\nBeaumains, since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me, wit ye well it\r\ngladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is no knight living\r\nbut I am able enough for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Beaumains fought with Sir Persant of Inde, and made\r\nhim to be yielden.\r\n\r\nWith this Sir Persant of Inde had espied them as they hoved in the\r\nfield, and knightly he sent to them whether he came in war or in peace.\r\nSay to thy lord, said Beaumains, I take no force, but whether as him\r\nlist himself. So the messenger went again unto Sir Persant and told him\r\nall his answer. Well then will I have ado with him to the utterance,\r\nand so he purveyed him and rode against him. And Beaumains saw him and\r\nmade him ready, and there they met with all that ever their horses\r\nmight run, and brast their spears either in three pieces, and their\r\nhorses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the\r\nearth; and lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields\r\nafore them, and drew their swords, and gave many great strokes that\r\nsometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the ground.\r\nThus they fought two hours and more, that their shields and their\r\nhauberks were all forhewen, and in many steads they were wounded. So at\r\nthe last Sir Beaumains smote him through the cost of the body, and then\r\nhe retrayed him here and there, and knightly maintained his battle long\r\ntime. And at the last, though him loath were, Beaumains smote Sir\r\nPersant above upon the helm, that he fell grovelling to the earth; and\r\nthen he leapt upon him overthwart and unlaced his helm to have slain\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Persant yielded him and asked him mercy. With that came the\r\ndamosel and prayed to save his life. I will well, for it were pity this\r\nnoble knight should die. Gramercy, said Persant, gentle knight and\r\ndamosel. For certainly now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother\r\nthe Black Knight at the black thorn; he was a full noble knight, his\r\nname was Sir Percard. Also I am sure that ye are he that won mine other\r\nbrother the Green Knight, his name was Sir Pertolepe. Also ye won my\r\nbrother the Red Knight, Sir Perimones. And now since ye have won these,\r\nthis shall I do for to please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of\r\nme, and an hundred knights to be always at your commandment, to go and\r\nride where ye will command us. And so they went unto Sir Persant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npavilion and drank the wine, and ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant\r\nmade him to rest upon a bed until supper time, and after supper to bed\r\nagain. When Beaumains was abed, Sir Persant had a lady, a fair daughter\r\nof eighteen year of age, and there he called her unto him, and charged\r\nher and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the knight\xe2\x80\x99s bed,\r\nand lie down by his side, and make him no strange cheer, but good\r\ncheer, and take him in thine arms and kiss him, and look that this be\r\ndone, I charge you, as ye will have my love and my good will. So Sir\r\nPersant\xe2\x80\x99s daughter did as her father bade her, and so she went unto Sir\r\nBeaumains\xe2\x80\x99 bed, and privily she dispoiled her, and laid her down by\r\nhim, and then he awoke and saw her, and asked her what she was. Sir,\r\nshe said, I am Sir Persant\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, that by the commandment of my\r\nfather am come hither. Be ye a maid or a wife? said he. Sir, she said,\r\nI am a clean maiden. God defend, said he, that I should defoil you to\r\ndo Sir Persant such a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this\r\nbed or else I will. Sir, she said, I came not to you by mine own will,\r\nbut as I was commanded. Alas, said Sir Beaumains, I were a shameful\r\nknight an I would do your father any disworship; and so he kissed her,\r\nand so she departed and came unto Sir Persant her father, and told him\r\nall how she had sped. Truly, said Sir Persant, whatsomever he be, he is\r\ncome of a noble blood. And so we leave them there till on the morn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. Of the goodly communication between Sir Persant and\r\nBeaumains, and how he told him that his name was Sir Gareth.\r\n\r\nAnd so on the morn the damosel and Sir Beaumains heard mass and brake\r\ntheir fast, and so took their leave. Fair damosel, said Persant,\r\nwhitherward are ye way-leading this knight? Sir, she said, this knight\r\nis going to the siege that besiegeth my sister in the Castle Dangerous.\r\nAh, ah, said Persant, that is the Knight of the Red Laund, the which is\r\nthe most perilous knight that I know now living, and a man that is\r\nwithout mercy, and men say that he hath seven men\xe2\x80\x99s strength. God save\r\nyou, said he to Beaumains, from that knight, for he doth great wrong to\r\nthat lady, and that is great pity, for she is one of the fairest ladies\r\nof the world, and meseemeth that your damosel is her sister: is not\r\nyour name Linet? said he. Yea, sir, said she, and my lady my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname is Dame Lionesse. Now shall I tell you, said Sir Persant, this Red\r\nKnight of the Red Laund hath lain long at the siege, well-nigh this two\r\nyears, and many times he might have had her an he had would, but he\r\nprolongeth the time to this intent, for to have Sir Launcelot du Lake\r\nto do battle with him, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, or Sir\r\nGawaine, and this is his tarrying so long at the siege.\r\n\r\nNow my lord Sir Persant of Inde, said the damosel Linet, I require you\r\nthat ye will make this gentleman knight or ever he fight with the Red\r\nKnight. I will with all my heart, said Sir Persant, an it please him to\r\ntake the order of knighthood of so simple a man as I am. Sir, said\r\nBeaumains, I thank you for your good will, for I am better sped, for\r\ncertainly the noble knight Sir Launcelot made me knight. Ah, said Sir\r\nPersant, of a more renowned knight might ye not be made knight; for of\r\nall knights he may be called chief of knighthood; and so all the world\r\nsaith, that betwixt three knights is departed clearly knighthood, that\r\nis Launcelot du Lake, Sir Tristram de Liones, and Sir Lamorak de Galis:\r\nthese bear now the renown. There be many other knights, as Sir\r\nPalamides the Saracen and Sir Safere his brother; also Sir Bleoberis\r\nand Sir Blamore de Ganis his brother; also Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir\r\nEctor de Maris and Sir Percivale de Galis; these and many more be noble\r\nknights, but there be none that pass the three above said; therefore\r\nGod speed you well, said Sir Persant, for an ye may match the Red\r\nKnight ye shall be called the fourth of the world.\r\n\r\nSir, said Beaumains, I would fain be of good fame and of knighthood.\r\nAnd I let you wit I came of good men, for I dare say my father was a\r\nnoble man, and so that ye will keep it in close, and this damosel, I\r\nwill tell you of what kin I am. We will not discover you, said they\r\nboth, till ye command us, by the faith we owe unto God. Truly then,\r\nsaid he, my name is Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, and\r\nmy mother is King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sister, her name is Dame Morgawse, and Sir\r\nGawaine is my brother, and Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and I am the\r\nyoungest of them all. And yet wot not King Arthur nor Sir Gawaine what\r\nI am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How the lady that was besieged had word from her sister\r\nhow she had brought a knight to fight for her, and what battles he had\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nSo the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s coming by the dwarf, and a knight with her, and how he had\r\npassed all the perilous passages. What manner a man is he? said the\r\nlady. He is a noble knight, truly, madam, said the dwarf, and but a\r\nyoung man, but he is as likely a man as ever ye saw any. What is he?\r\nsaid the damosel, and of what kin is he come, and of whom was he made\r\nknight? Madam, said the dwarf, he is the king\xe2\x80\x99s son of Orkney, but his\r\nname I will not tell you as at this time; but wit ye well, of Sir\r\nLauncelot was he made knight, for of none other would he be made\r\nknight, and Sir Kay named him Beaumains. How escaped he, said the lady,\r\nfrom the brethren of Persant? Madam, he said, as a noble knight should.\r\nFirst, he slew two brethren at a passage of a water. Ah! said she, they\r\nwere good knights, but they were murderers, the one hight Gherard le\r\nBreuse, and the other knight hight Sir Arnold le Breuse. Then, madam,\r\nhe recountered with the Black Knight, and slew him in plain battle, and\r\nso he took his horse and his armour and fought with the Green Knight\r\nand won him in plain battle, and in like wise he served the Red Knight,\r\nand after in the same wise he served the Blue Knight and won him in\r\nplain battle. Then, said the lady, he hath overcome Sir Persant of\r\nInde, one of the noblest knights of the world, and the dwarf said, He\r\nhath won all the four brethren and slain the Black Knight, and yet he\r\ndid more to-fore: he overthrew Sir Kay and left him nigh dead upon the\r\nground; also he did a great battle with Sir Launcelot, and there they\r\ndeparted on even hands: and then Sir Launcelot made him knight.\r\n\r\nDwarf, said the lady, I am glad of these tidings, therefore go thou in\r\nan hermitage of mine hereby, and there shalt thou bear with thee of my\r\nwine in two flagons of silver, they are of two gallons, and also two\r\ncast of bread with fat venison baked, and dainty fowls; and a cup of\r\ngold here I deliver thee, that is rich and precious; and bear all this\r\nto mine hermitage, and put it in the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s hands. And sithen go thou\r\nunto my sister and greet her well, and commend me unto that gentle\r\nknight, and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong, and say\r\nye him I thank him of his courtesy and goodness, that he would take\r\nupon him such labour for me that never did him bounty nor courtesy.\r\nAlso pray him that he be of good heart and courage, for he shall meet\r\nwith a full noble knight, but he is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor\r\ngentleness; for he attendeth unto nothing but to murder, and that is\r\nthe cause I cannot praise him nor love him.\r\n\r\nSo this dwarf departed, and came to Sir Persant, where he found the\r\ndamosel Linet and Sir Beaumains, and there he told them all as ye have\r\nheard; and then they took their leave, but Sir Persant took an ambling\r\nhackney and conveyed them on their ways, and then beleft them to God;\r\nand so within a little while they came to that hermitage, and there\r\nthey drank the wine, and ate the venison and the fowls baken. And so\r\nwhen they had repasted them well, the dwarf returned again with his\r\nvessel unto the castle again; and there met with him the Red Knight of\r\nthe Red Launds, and asked him from whence that he came, and where he\r\nhad been. Sir, said the dwarf, I have been with my lady\xe2\x80\x99s sister of\r\nthis castle, and she hath been at King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, and brought a\r\nknight with her. Then I account her travail but lost; for though she\r\nhad brought with her Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Lamorak, or Sir\r\nGawaine, I would think myself good enough for them all.\r\n\r\nIt may well be, said the dwarf, but this knight hath passed all the\r\nperilous passages, and slain the Black Knight and other two more, and\r\nwon the Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight. Then is he\r\none of these four that I have afore rehearsed. He is none of those,\r\nsaid the dwarf, but he is a king\xe2\x80\x99s son. What is his name? said the Red\r\nKnight of the Red Launds. That will I not tell you, said the dwarf, but\r\nSir Kay upon scorn named him Beaumains. I care not, said the knight,\r\nwhat knight so ever he be, for I shall soon deliver him. And if I ever\r\nmatch him he shall have a shameful death as many other have had. That\r\nwere pity, said the dwarf, and it is marvel that ye make such shameful\r\nwar upon noble knights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege; and came\r\nto a sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew a horn, and then the\r\nKnight of the Red Launds came to fight with him.\r\n\r\nNow leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains, that\r\nall night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he and the damosel\r\nLinet heard their mass and brake their fast. And then they took their\r\nhorses and rode throughout a fair forest; and then they came to a\r\nplain, and saw where were many pavilions and tents, and a fair castle,\r\nand there was much smoke and great noise; and when they came near the\r\nsiege Sir Beaumains espied upon great trees, as he rode, how there hung\r\nfull goodly armed knights by the neck, and their shields about their\r\nnecks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there\r\nhung nigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Beaumains abated his countenance and said, What meaneth this?\r\nFair sir, said the damosel, abate not your cheer for all this sight,\r\nfor ye must courage yourself, or else ye be all shent, for all these\r\nknights came hither to this siege to rescue my sister Dame Lionesse,\r\nand when the Red Knight of the Red Launds had overcome them, he put\r\nthem to this shameful death without mercy and pity. And in the same\r\nwise he will serve you but if you quit you the better.\r\n\r\nNow Jesu defend me, said Beaumains, from such a villainous death and\r\nshenship of arms. For rather than I should so be faren withal, I would\r\nrather be slain manly in plain battle. So were ye better, said the\r\ndamosel; for trust not, in him is no courtesy, but all goeth to the\r\ndeath or shameful murder, and that is pity, for he is a full likely\r\nman, well made of body, and a full noble knight of prowess, and a lord\r\nof great lands and possessions. Truly, said Beaumains, he may well be a\r\ngood knight, but he useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he\r\nendureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhave not dealt with him.\r\n\r\nAnd then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with full\r\nwarlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls;\r\nand there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beat upon the one\r\nside of the walls, where were many ships and mariners\xe2\x80\x99 noise with \xe2\x80\x9chale\r\nand how.\xe2\x80\x9d And also there was fast by a sycamore tree, and there hung an\r\nhorn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant\xe2\x80\x99s bone; and this\r\nKnight of the Red Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any\r\nerrant-knight, he must blow that horn, and then will he make him ready\r\nand come to him to do battle. But, sir, I pray you, said the damosel\r\nLinet, blow ye not the horn till it be high noon, for now it is about\r\nprime, and now increaseth his might, that as men say he hath seven\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s strength. Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel, say ye never so more\r\nto me; for, an he were as good a knight as ever was, I shall never fail\r\nhim in his most might, for either I will win worship worshipfully, or\r\ndie knightly in the field. And therewith he spurred his horse straight\r\nto the sycamore tree, and blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege\r\nand the castle rang thereof. And then there leapt out knights out of\r\ntheir tents and pavilions, and they within the castle looked over the\r\nwalls and out at windows.\r\n\r\nThen the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him hastily, and two barons\r\nset on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red, his armour,\r\nspear and shield. And an earl buckled his helm upon his head, and then\r\nthey brought him a red spear and a red steed, and so he rode into a\r\nlittle vale under the castle, that all that were in the castle and at\r\nthe siege might behold the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How the two knights met together, and of their talking,\r\nand how they began their battle.\r\n\r\nSir, said the damosel Linet unto Sir Beaumains, look ye be glad and\r\nlight, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my\r\nlady, my sister, Dame Lionesse. Where? said Beaumains. Yonder, said the\r\ndamosel, and pointed with her finger. That is truth, said Beaumains.\r\nShe beseemeth afar the fairest lady that ever I looked upon; and truly,\r\nhe said, I ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle, for truly\r\nshe shall be my lady, and for her I will fight. And ever he looked up\r\nto the window with glad countenance, and the Lady Lionesse made curtsey\r\nto him down to the earth, with holding up both their hands.\r\n\r\nWith that the Red Knight of the Red Launds called to Sir Beaumains,\r\nLeave, sir knight, thy looking, and behold me, I counsel thee; for I\r\nwarn thee well she is my lady, and for her I have done many strong\r\nbattles. If thou have so done, said Beaumains, meseemeth it was but\r\nwaste labour, for she loveth none of thy fellowship, and thou to love\r\nthat loveth not thee is but great folly. For an I understood that she\r\nwere not glad of my coming, I would be advised or I did battle for her.\r\nBut I understand by the besieging of this castle she may forbear thy\r\nfellowship. And therefore wit thou well, thou Red Knight of the Red\r\nLaunds, I love her, and will rescue her, or else to die. Sayst thou\r\nthat? said the Red Knight, meseemeth thou ought of reason to be ware by\r\nyonder knights that thou sawest hang upon yonder trees. Fie for shame,\r\nsaid Beaumains, that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil, for in that\r\nthou shamest thyself and knighthood, and thou mayst be sure there will\r\nno lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked customs. And now thou weenest\r\nthat the sight of these hanged knights should fear me. Nay truly, not\r\nso; that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness\r\nagainst thee, more than I would have had against thee an thou wert a\r\nwell-ruled knight. Make thee ready, said the Red Knight of the Red\r\nLaunds, and talk no longer with me.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Beaumains bade the damosel go from him; and then they put\r\ntheir spears in their rests, and came together with all their might\r\nthat they had both, and either smote other in midst of their shields\r\nthat the paitrelles, surcingles, and cruppers brast, and fell to the\r\nearth both, and the reins of their bridles in their hands; and so they\r\nlay a great while sore astonied, that all that were in the castle and\r\nin the siege weened their necks had been broken; and then many a\r\nstranger and other said the strange knight was a big man, and a noble\r\njouster, for or now we saw never no knight match the Red Knight of the\r\nRed Launds: thus they said, both within the castle and without. Then\r\nlightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and\r\ndrew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions, and either\r\ngave other such buffets upon their helms that they reeled backward both\r\ntwo strides; and then they recovered both, and hewed great pieces off\r\ntheir harness and their shields that a great part fell into the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How after long fighting Beaumains overcame the knight and\r\nwould have slain him, but at the request of the lords he saved his\r\nlife, and made him to yield him to the lady.\r\n\r\nAnd then thus they fought till it was past noon, and never would stint,\r\ntill at the last they lacked wind both; and then they stood wagging and\r\nscattering, panting, blowing and bleeding, that all that beheld them\r\nfor the most part wept for pity. So when they had rested them a while\r\nthey yede to battle again, tracing, racing, foining as two boars. And\r\nat some time they took their run as it had been two rams, and hurtled\r\ntogether that sometime they fell grovelling to the earth: and at some\r\ntime they were so amazed that either took other\xe2\x80\x99s sword instead of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThus they endured till evensong time, that there was none that beheld\r\nthem might know whether was like to win the battle; and their armour\r\nwas so forhewn that men might see their naked sides; and in other\r\nplaces they were naked, but ever the naked places they did defend. And\r\nthe Red Knight was a wily knight of war, and his wily fighting taught\r\nSir Beaumains to be wise; but he abought it full sore or he did espy\r\nhis fighting.\r\n\r\nAnd thus by assent of them both they granted either other to rest; and\r\nso they set them down upon two mole-hills there beside the fighting\r\nplace, and either of them unlaced his helm, and took the cold wind; for\r\neither of their pages was fast by them, to come when they called to\r\nunlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment. And\r\nthen when Sir Beaumains\xe2\x80\x99 helm was off, he looked up to the window, and\r\nthere he saw the fair lady Dame Lionesse, and she made him such\r\ncountenance that his heart waxed light and jolly; and therewith he bade\r\nthe Red Knight of the Red Launds make him ready, and let us do the\r\nbattle to the utterance. I will well, said the knight, and then they\r\nlaced up their helms, and their pages avoided, and they stepped\r\ntogether and fought freshly; but the Red Knight of the Red Launds\r\nawaited him, and at an overthwart smote him within the hand, that his\r\nsword fell out of his hand; and yet he gave him another buffet upon the\r\nhelm that he fell grovelling to the earth, and the Red Knight fell over\r\nhim, for to hold him down.\r\n\r\nThen cried the maiden Linet on high: O Sir Beaumains, where is thy\r\ncourage become? Alas, my lady my sister beholdeth thee, and she sobbeth\r\nand weepeth, that maketh mine heart heavy. When Sir Beaumains heard her\r\nsay so, he abraid up with a great might and gat him upon his feet, and\r\nlightly he leapt to his sword and gripped it in his hand, and doubled\r\nhis pace unto the Red Knight, and there they fought a new battle\r\ntogether. But Sir Beaumains then doubled his strokes, and smote so\r\nthick that he smote the sword out of his hand, and then he smote him\r\nupon the helm that he fell to the earth, and Sir Beaumains fell upon\r\nhim, and unlaced his helm to have slain him; and then he yielded him\r\nand asked mercy, and said with a loud voice: O noble knight, I yield me\r\nto thy mercy.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Beaumains bethought him upon the knights that he had made to\r\nbe hanged shamefully, and then he said: I may not with my worship save\r\nthy life, for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good\r\nknights to die. Sir, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, hold your\r\nhand and ye shall know the causes why I put them to so shameful a\r\ndeath. Say on, said Sir Beaumains. Sir, I loved once a lady, a fair\r\ndamosel, and she had her brother slain; and she said it was Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake, or else Sir Gawaine; and she prayed me as that I\r\nloved her heartily, that I would make her a promise by the faith of my\r\nknighthood, for to labour daily in arms unto I met with one of them;\r\nand all that I might overcome I should put them unto a villainous\r\ndeath; and this is the cause that I have put all these knights to\r\ndeath, and so I ensured her to do all the villainy unto King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknights, and that I should take vengeance upon all these knights. And,\r\nsir, now I will thee tell that every day my strength increaseth till\r\nnoon, and all this time have I seven men\xe2\x80\x99s strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How the knight yielded him, and how Beaumains made him\r\nto go unto King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, and to cry Sir Launcelot mercy.\r\n\r\nThen came there many earls, and barons, and noble knights, and prayed\r\nthat knight to save his life, and take him to your prisoner. And all\r\nthey fell upon their knees, and prayed him of mercy, and that he would\r\nsave his life; and, Sir, they all said, it were fairer of him to take\r\nhomage and fealty, and let him hold his lands of you than for to slay\r\nhim; by his death ye shall have none advantage, and his misdeeds that\r\nbe done may not be undone; and therefore he shall make amends to all\r\nparties, and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty.\r\nFair lords, said Beaumains, wit you well I am full loath to slay this\r\nknight, nevertheless he hath done passing ill and shamefully; but\r\ninsomuch all that he did was at a lady\xe2\x80\x99s request I blame him the less;\r\nand so for your sake I will release him that he shall have his life\r\nupon this covenant, that he go within the castle, and yield him there\r\nto the lady, and if she will forgive and quit him, I will well; with\r\nthis he make her amends of all the trespass he hath done against her\r\nand her lands. And also, when that is done, that ye go unto the court\r\nof King Arthur, and there that ye ask Sir Launcelot mercy, and Sir\r\nGawaine, for the evil will ye have had against them. Sir, said the Red\r\nKnight of the Red Launds, all this will I do as ye command, and siker\r\nassurance and borrows ye shall have. And so then when the assurance was\r\nmade, he made his homage and fealty, and all those earls and barons\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nAnd then the maiden Linet came to Sir Beaumains, and unarmed him and\r\nsearched his wounds, and stinted his blood, and in likewise she did to\r\nthe Red Knight of the Red Launds. And there they sojourned ten days in\r\ntheir tents; and the Red Knight made his lords and servants to do all\r\nthe pleasure that they might unto Sir Beaumains. And so within a while\r\nthe Red Knight of the Red Launds yede unto the castle, and put him in\r\nher grace. And so she received him upon sufficient surety, so all her\r\nhurts were well restored of all that she could complain. And then he\r\ndeparted unto the court of King Arthur, and there openly the Red Knight\r\nof the Red Launds put him in the mercy of Sir Launcelot and Sir\r\nGawaine, and there he told openly how he was overcome and by whom, and\r\nalso he told all the battles from the beginning unto the ending. Jesu\r\nmercy, said King Arthur and Sir Gawaine, we marvel much of what blood\r\nhe is come, for he is a noble knight. Have ye no marvel, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, for ye shall right well wit that he is come of a full noble\r\nblood; and as for his might and hardiness, there be but few now living\r\nthat is so mighty as he is, and so noble of prowess. It seemeth by you,\r\nsaid King Arthur, that ye know his name, and from whence he is come,\r\nand of what blood he is. I suppose I do so, said Launcelot, or else I\r\nwould not have given him the order of knighthood; but he gave me such\r\ncharge at that time that I should never discover him until he required\r\nme, or else it be known openly by some other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the\r\ncastle the gates were closed against him, and of the words that the\r\nlady said to him.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he might see\r\nher sister, his lady. Sir, she said, I would fain ye saw her. Then Sir\r\nBeaumains all armed him, and took his horse and his spear, and rode\r\nstraight unto the castle. And when he came to the gate he found there\r\nmany men armed, and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port close.\r\n\r\nThen marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter. And then he\r\nlooked up to the window; and there he saw the fair Lionesse that said\r\non high: Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as yet thou shalt not have\r\nwholly my love, unto the time that thou be called one of the number of\r\nthe worthy knights. And therefore go labour in worship this\r\ntwelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear new tidings. Alas, fair lady,\r\nsaid Beaumains, I have not deserved that ye should show me this\r\nstrangeness, and I had weened that I should have right good cheer with\r\nyou, and unto my power I have deserved thank, and well I am sure I have\r\nbought your love with part of the best blood within my body. Fair\r\ncourteous knight, said Dame Lionesse, be not displeased nor over-hasty;\r\nfor wit you well your great travail nor good love shall not be lost,\r\nfor I consider your great travail and labour, your bounty and your\r\ngoodness as me ought to do. And therefore go on your way, and look that\r\nye be of good comfort, for all shall be for your worship and for the\r\nbest, and perdy a twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair\r\nknight, I shall be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my\r\ndeath I shall love you and none other. And therewithal she turned her\r\nfrom the window, and Sir Beaumains rode awayward from the castle,\r\nmaking great dole, and so he rode here and there and wist not where he\r\nrode, till it was dark night. And then it happened him to come to a\r\npoor man\xe2\x80\x99s house, and there he was harboured all that night.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the love of\r\nthe lady of the castle. And so upon the morrow he took his horse and\r\nrode until underne, and then he came to a broad water, and thereby was\r\na great lodge, and there he alighted to sleep and laid his head upon\r\nthe shield, and betook his horse to the dwarf, and commanded him to\r\nwatch all night.\r\n\r\nNow turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much upon\r\nBeaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her brother, and\r\nprayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily, that he would ride\r\nafter Sir Beaumains: And ever have ye wait upon him till ye may find\r\nhim sleeping, for I am sure in his heaviness he will alight down in\r\nsome place, and lie him down to sleep; and therefore have ye your wait\r\nupon him, and in the priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye\r\nyour way with him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake. For my\r\nsister Linet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come,\r\nand what is his right name. And the meanwhile I and my sister will ride\r\nunto your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. And then\r\nwhen ye have brought him unto your castle, I will have him in\r\nexamination myself. Unto the time that I know what is his right name,\r\nand of what kindred he is come, shall I never be merry at my heart.\r\nSister, said Sir Gringamore, all this shall be done after your intent.\r\n\r\nAnd so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found Sir\r\nBeaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for to sleep.\r\nAnd then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he came stilly stalking\r\nbehind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under his arm, and so he rode\r\naway with him as fast as ever he might unto his own castle. And this\r\nSir Gringamore\xe2\x80\x99s arms were all black, and that to him longeth. But ever\r\nas he rode with the dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and\r\nprayed him of help. And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt\r\nlightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the dwarf, and\r\nso Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. How Sir Beaumains rode after to rescue his dwarf, and came\r\ninto the castle where he was.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Beaumains put on his helm anon, and buckled his shield, and\r\ntook his horse, and rode after him all that ever he might ride through\r\nmarshes, and fields, and great dales, that many times his horse and he\r\nplunged over the head in deep mires, for he knew not the way, but took\r\nthe gainest way in that woodness, that many times he was like to\r\nperish. And at the last him happened to come to a fair green way, and\r\nthere he met with a poor man of the country, whom he saluted and asked\r\nhim whether he met not with a knight upon a black horse and all black\r\nharness, a little dwarf sitting behind him with heavy cheer. Sir, said\r\nthe poor man, here by me came Sir Gringamore the knight, with such a\r\ndwarf mourning as ye say; and therefore I rede you not follow him, for\r\nhe is one of the periloust knights of the world, and his castle is here\r\nnigh hand but two mile; therefore we advise you ride not after Sir\r\nGringamore, but if ye owe him good will.\r\n\r\nSo leave we Sir Beaumains riding toward the castle, and speak we of Sir\r\nGringamore and the dwarf. Anon as the dwarf was come to the castle,\r\nDame Lionesse and Dame Linet her sister, asked the dwarf where was his\r\nmaster born, and of what lineage he was come. And but if thou tell me,\r\nsaid Dame Lionesse, thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here\r\nto be prisoner. As for that, said the dwarf, I fear not greatly to tell\r\nhis name and of what kin he is come. Wit you well he is a king\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nand his mother is sister to King Arthur, and he is brother to the good\r\nknight Sir Gawaine, and his name is Sir Gareth of Orkney. And now I\r\nhave told you his right name, I pray you, fair lady, let me go to my\r\nlord again, for he will never out of this country until that he have me\r\nagain. And if he be angry he will do much harm or that he be stint, and\r\nwork you wrack in this country. As for that threatening, said Sir\r\nGringamore, be it as it be may, we will go to dinner. And so they\r\nwashed and went to meat, and made them merry and well at ease, and\r\nbecause the Lady Lionesse of the castle was there, they made great joy.\r\nTruly, madam, said Linet unto her sister, well may he be a king\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nfor he hath many good tatches on him, for he is courteous and mild, and\r\nthe most suffering man that ever I met withal. For I dare say there was\r\nnever gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as I have rebuked\r\nhim; and at all times he gave me goodly and meek answers again.\r\n\r\nAnd as they sat thus talking, there came Sir Gareth in at the gate with\r\nan angry countenance, and his sword drawn in his hand, and cried aloud\r\nthat all the castle might hear it, saying: Thou traitor, Sir\r\nGringamore, deliver me my dwarf again, or by the faith that I owe to\r\nthe order of knighthood, I shall do thee all the harm that I can. Then\r\nSir Gringamore looked out at a window and said, Sir Gareth of Orkney,\r\nleave thy boasting words, for thou gettest not thy dwarf again. Thou\r\ncoward knight, said Sir Gareth, bring him with thee, and come and do\r\nbattle with me, and win him and take him. So will I do, said Sir\r\nGringamore, an me list, but for all thy great words thou gettest him\r\nnot. Ah! fair brother, said Dame Lionesse, I would he had his dwarf\r\nagain, for I would he were not wroth, for now he hath told me all my\r\ndesire I keep no more of the dwarf. And also, brother, he hath done\r\nmuch for me, and delivered me from the Red Knight of the Red Launds,\r\nand therefore, brother, I owe him my service afore all knights living.\r\nAnd wit ye well that I love him before all other, and full fain I would\r\nspeak with him. But in nowise I would that he wist what I were, but\r\nthat I were another strange lady.\r\n\r\nWell, said Sir Gringamore, sithen I know now your will, I will obey now\r\nunto him. And right therewithal he went down unto Sir Gareth, and said:\r\nSir, I cry you mercy, and all that I have misdone I will amend it at\r\nyour will. And therefore I pray you that ye would alight, and take such\r\ncheer as I can make you in this castle. Shall I have my dwarf? said Sir\r\nGareth. Yea, sir, and all the pleasaunce that I can make you, for as\r\nsoon as your dwarf told me what ye were and of what blood ye are come,\r\nand what noble deeds ye have done in these marches, then I repented of\r\nmy deeds. And then Sir Gareth alighted, and there came his dwarf and\r\ntook his horse. O my fellow, said Sir Gareth, I have had many\r\nadventures for thy sake. And so Sir Gringamore took him by the hand and\r\nled him into the hall where his own wife was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the\r\npresence of his lady, and how they took acquaintance, and of their\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nAnd then came forth Dame Lionesse arrayed like a princess, and there\r\nshe made him passing good cheer, and he her again; and they had goodly\r\nlanguage and lovely countenance together. And Sir Gareth thought many\r\ntimes, Jesu, would that the lady of the Castle Perilous were so fair as\r\nshe was. There were all manner of games and plays, of dancing and\r\nsinging. And ever the more Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he\r\nloved her; and so he burned in love that he was past himself in his\r\nreason; and forth toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth\r\nmight not eat, for his love was so hot that he wist not where he was.\r\n\r\nAll these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at-after supper he\r\ncalled his sister Dame Lionesse into a chamber, and said: Fair sister,\r\nI have well espied your countenance betwixt you and this knight, and I\r\nwill, sister, that ye wit he is a full noble knight, and if ye can make\r\nhim to abide here I will do him all the pleasure that I can, for an ye\r\nwere better than ye are, ye were well bywaryd upon him. Fair brother,\r\nsaid Dame Lionesse, I understand well that the knight is good, and come\r\nhe is of a noble house. Notwithstanding, I will assay him better,\r\nhowbeit I am most beholden to him of any earthly man; for he hath had\r\ngreat labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous passage.\r\n\r\nRight so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, Sir, make ye\r\ngood cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady, my\r\nsister, is yours at all times, her worship saved, for wit ye well she\r\nloveth you as well as ye do her, and better if better may be. An I wist\r\nthat, said Sir Gareth, there lived not a gladder man than I would be.\r\nUpon my worship, said Sir Gringamore, trust unto my promise; and as\r\nlong as it liketh you ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall be\r\nwith us daily and nightly to make you all the cheer that she can. I\r\nwill well, said Sir Gareth, for I have promised to be nigh this country\r\nthis twelvemonth. And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble\r\nknights will find me where that I am within this twelvemonth. For I\r\nshall be sought and found, if that I be alive. And then the noble\r\nknight Sir Gareth went unto the Dame Lionesse, which he then much\r\nloved, and kissed her many times, and either made great joy of other.\r\nAnd there she promised him her love certainly, to love him and none\r\nother the days of her life. Then this lady, Dame Lionesse, by the\r\nassent of her brother, told Sir Gareth all the truth what she was, and\r\nhow she was the same lady that he did battle for, and how she was lady\r\nof the Castle Perilous, and there she told him how she caused her\r\nbrother to take away his dwarf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. How at night came an armed knight, and fought with Sir\r\nGareth, and he, sore hurt in the thigh, smote off the knight\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nFor this cause, to know the certainty what was your name, and of what\r\nkin ye were come.\r\n\r\nAnd then she let fetch to-fore him Linet, the damosel that had ridden\r\nwith him many wildsome ways. Then was Sir Gareth more gladder than he\r\nwas to-fore. And then they troth-plight each other to love, and never\r\nto fail whiles their life lasteth. And so they burnt both in love, that\r\nthey were accorded to abate their lusts secretly. And there Dame\r\nLionesse counselled Sir Gareth to sleep in none other place but in the\r\nhall. And there she promised him to come to his bed a little afore\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nThis counsel was not so privily kept but it was understood; for they\r\nwere but young both, and tender of age, and had not used none such\r\ncrafts to-fore. Wherefore the damosel Linet was a little displeased,\r\nand she thought her sister Dame Lionesse was a little over-hasty, that\r\nshe might not abide the time of her marriage; and for saving their\r\nworship, she thought to abate their hot lusts. And so she let ordain by\r\nher subtle crafts that they had not their intents neither with other,\r\nas in their delights, until they were married. And so it passed on.\r\nAt-after supper was made clean avoidance, that every lord and lady\r\nshould go unto his rest. But Sir Gareth said plainly he would go no\r\nfarther than the hall, for in such places, he said, was convenient for\r\nan errant-knight to take his rest in; and so there were ordained great\r\ncouches, and thereon feather beds, and there laid him down to sleep;\r\nand within a while came Dame Lionesse, wrapped in a mantle furred with\r\nermine, and laid her down beside Sir Gareth. And therewithal he began\r\nto kiss her. And then he looked afore him, and there he apperceived and\r\nsaw come an armed knight, with many lights about him; and this knight\r\nhad a long gisarm in his hand, and made grim countenance to smite him.\r\nWhen Sir Gareth saw him come in that wise, he leapt out of his bed, and\r\ngat in his hand his sword, and leapt straight toward that knight. And\r\nwhen the knight saw Sir Gareth come so fiercely upon him, he smote him\r\nwith a foin through the thick of the thigh that the wound was a\r\nshaftmon broad and had cut a-two many veins and sinews. And therewithal\r\nSir Gareth smote him upon the helm such a buffet that he fell\r\ngrovelling; and then he leapt over him and unlaced his helm, and smote\r\noff his head from the body. And then he bled so fast that he might not\r\nstand, but so he laid him down upon his bed, and there he swooned and\r\nlay as he had been dead.\r\n\r\nThen Dame Lionesse cried aloud, that her brother Sir Gringamore heard,\r\nand came down. And when he saw Sir Gareth so shamefully wounded he was\r\nsore displeased, and said: I am shamed that this noble knight is thus\r\nhonoured. Sir, said Sir Gringamore, how may this be, that ye be here,\r\nand this noble knight wounded? Brother, she said, I can not tell you,\r\nfor it was not done by me, nor by mine assent. For he is my lord and I\r\nam his, and he must be mine husband; therefore, my brother, I will that\r\nye wit I shame me not to be with him, nor to do him all the pleasure\r\nthat I can. Sister, said Sir Gringamore, and I will that ye wit it, and\r\nSir Gareth both, that it was never done by me, nor by my assent that\r\nthis unhappy deed was done. And there they staunched his bleeding as\r\nwell as they might, and great sorrow made Sir Gringamore and Dame\r\nLionesse.\r\n\r\nAnd forthwithal came Dame Linet, and took up the head in the sight of\r\nthem all, and anointed it with an ointment thereas it was smitten off;\r\nand in the same wise she did to the other part thereas the head stuck,\r\nand then she set it together, and it stuck as fast as ever it did. And\r\nthe knight arose lightly up, and the damosel Linet put him in her\r\nchamber. All this saw Sir Gringamore and Dame Lionesse, and so did Sir\r\nGareth; and well he espied that it was the damosel Linet, that rode\r\nwith him through the perilous passages. Ah well, damosel, said Sir\r\nGareth, I weened ye would not have done as ye have done. My lord\r\nGareth, said Linet, all that I have done I will avow, and all that I\r\nhave done shall be for your honour and worship, and to us all. And so\r\nwithin a while Sir Gareth was nigh whole, and waxed light and jocund,\r\nand sang, danced, and gamed; and he and Dame Lionesse were so hot in\r\nburning love that they made their covenant at the tenth night after,\r\nthat she should come to his bed. And because he was wounded afore, he\r\nlaid his armour and his sword nigh his bed\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. How the said knight came again the next night and was\r\nbeheaded again, and how at the feast of Pentecost all the knights that\r\nSir Gareth had overcome came and yielded them to King Arthur.\r\n\r\nRight as she promised she came; and she was not so soon in his bed but\r\nshe espied an armed knight coming toward the bed: therewithal she\r\nwarned Sir Gareth, and lightly through the good help of Dame Lionesse\r\nhe was armed; and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all\r\nabout the hall; and there was great light as it had been the number of\r\ntwenty torches both before and behind, so that Sir Gareth strained him,\r\nso that his old wound brast again a-bleeding; but he was hot and\r\ncourageous and took no keep, but with his great force he struck down\r\nthat knight, and voided his helm, and struck off his head. Then he\r\nhewed the head in an hundred pieces. And when he had done so he took up\r\nall those pieces, and threw them out at a window into the ditches of\r\nthe castle; and by this done he was so faint that unnethes he might\r\nstand for bleeding. And by when he was almost unarmed he fell in a\r\ndeadly swoon on the floor; and then Dame Lionesse cried so that Sir\r\nGringamore heard; and when he came and found Sir Gareth in that plight\r\nhe made great sorrow; and there he awaked Sir Gareth, and gave him a\r\ndrink that relieved him wonderly well; but the sorrow that Dame\r\nLionesse made there may no tongue tell, for she so fared with herself\r\nas she would have died.\r\n\r\nRight so came this damosel Linet before them all, and she had fetched\r\nall the gobbets of the head that Sir Gareth had thrown out at a window,\r\nand there she anointed them as she had done to-fore, and set them\r\ntogether again. Well, damosel Linet, said Sir Gareth, I have not\r\ndeserved all this despite that ye do unto me. Sir knight, she said, I\r\nhave nothing done but I will avow, and all that I have done shall be to\r\nyour worship, and to us all. And then was Sir Gareth staunched of his\r\nbleeding. But the leeches said that there was no man that bare the life\r\nshould heal him throughout of his wound but if they healed him that\r\ncaused that stroke by enchantment.\r\n\r\nSo leave we Sir Gareth there with Sir Gringamore and his sisters, and\r\nturn we unto King Arthur, that at the next feast of Pentecost held his\r\nfeast; and there came the Green Knight with fifty knights, and yielded\r\nthem all unto King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight his\r\nbrother, and yielded him to King Arthur, and three score knights with\r\nhim. Also there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an hundred\r\nknights, and yielded them unto King Arthur; and the Green Knight\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nwas Pertolepe, and the Red Knight\xe2\x80\x99s name was Perimones, and the Blue\r\nKnight\xe2\x80\x99s name was Sir Persant of Inde. These three brethren told King\r\nArthur how they were overcome by a knight that a damosel had with her,\r\nand called him Beaumains. Jesu, said the king, I marvel what knight he\r\nis, and of what lineage he is come. He was with me a twelvemonth, and\r\npoorly and shamefully he was fostered, and Sir Kay in scorn named him\r\nBeaumains. So right as the king stood so talking with these three\r\nbrethren, there came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told the king that\r\nthere was come a goodly lord with six hundred knights with him.\r\n\r\nThen the king went out of Carlion, for there was the feast, and there\r\ncame to him this lord, and saluted the king in a goodly manner. What\r\nwill ye, said King Arthur, and what is your errand? Sir, he said, my\r\nname is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, but my name is Sir Ironside;\r\nand sir, wit ye well, here I am sent to you of a knight that is called\r\nBeaumains, for he won me in plain battle hand for hand, and so did\r\nnever no knight but he, that ever had the better of me this thirty\r\nwinter; the which commanded to yield me to you at your will. Ye are\r\nwelcome, said the king, for ye have been long a great foe to me and my\r\ncourt, and now I trust to God I shall so entreat you that ye shall be\r\nmy friend. Sir, both I and these five hundred knights shall always be\r\nat your summons to do you service as may lie in our powers. Jesu mercy,\r\nsaid King Arthur, I am much beholden unto that knight that hath put so\r\nhis body in devoir to worship me and my court. And as to thee,\r\nIronside, that art called the Red Knight of the Red Launds, thou art\r\ncalled a perilous knight; and if thou wilt hold of me I shall worship\r\nthee and make thee knight of the Table Round; but then thou must be no\r\nmore a murderer. Sir, as to that, I have promised unto Sir Beaumains\r\nnever more to use such customs, for all the shameful customs that I\r\nused I did at the request of a lady that I loved; and therefore I must\r\ngo unto Sir Launcelot, and unto Sir Gawaine, and ask them forgiveness\r\nof the evil will I had unto them; for all that I put to death was all\r\nonly for the love of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Gawaine. They be here\r\nnow, said the king, afore thee, now may ye say to them what ye will.\r\nAnd then he kneeled down unto Sir Launcelot, and to Sir Gawaine, and\r\nprayed them of forgiveness of his enmity that ever he had against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur pardoned them, and demanded of them where\r\nSir Gareth was.\r\n\r\nThen goodly they said all at once, God forgive you, and we do, and pray\r\nyou that ye will tell us where we may find Sir Beaumains. Fair lords,\r\nsaid Sir Ironside, I cannot tell you, for it is full hard to find him;\r\nfor such young knights as he is one, when they be in their adventures\r\nbe never abiding in no place. But to say the worship that the Red\r\nKnight of the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother said of\r\nBeaumains, it was marvel to hear. Well, my fair lords, said King\r\nArthur, wit you well I shall do you honour for the love of Sir\r\nBeaumains, and as soon as ever I meet with him I shall make you all\r\nupon one day knights of the Table Round. And as to thee, Sir Persant of\r\nInde, thou hast been ever called a full noble knight, and so have ever\r\nbeen thy three brethren called. But I marvel, said the king, that I\r\nhear not of the Black Knight your brother, he was a full noble knight.\r\nSir, said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, Sir Beaumains slew him in a\r\nrecounter with his spear, his name was Sir Percard. That was great\r\npity, said the king, and so said many knights. For these four brethren\r\nwere full well known in the court of King Arthur for noble knights, for\r\nlong time they had holden war against the knights of the Round Table.\r\nThen said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, to the king: At a passage of the\r\nwater of Mortaise there encountered Sir Beaumains with two brethren\r\nthat ever for the most part kept that passage, and they were two deadly\r\nknights, and there he slew the eldest brother in the water, and smote\r\nhim upon the head such a buffet that he fell down in the water, and\r\nthere he was drowned, and his name was Sir Gherard le Breusse; and\r\nafter he slew the other brother upon the land, his name was Sir Arnold\r\nle Breusse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. How the Queen of Orkney came to this feast of Pentecost,\r\nand Sir Gawaine and his brethren came to ask her blessing.\r\n\r\nSo then the king and they went to meat, and were served in the best\r\nmanner. And as they sat at the meat, there came in the Queen of Orkney,\r\nwith ladies and knights a great number. And then Sir Gawaine, Sir\r\nAgravaine, and Gaheris arose, and went to her and saluted her upon\r\ntheir knees, and asked her blessing; for in fifteen year they had not\r\nseen her. Then she spake on high to her brother King Arthur: Where have\r\nye done my young son Sir Gareth? He was here amongst you a twelvemonth,\r\nand ye made a kitchen knave of him, the which is shame to you all.\r\nAlas, where have ye done my dear son that was my joy and bliss? O dear\r\nmother, said Sir Gawaine, I knew him not. Nor I, said the king, that\r\nnow me repenteth, but thanked be God he is proved a worshipful knight\r\nas any is now living of his years, and I shall never be glad till I may\r\nfind him.\r\n\r\nAh, brother, said the Queen unto King Arthur, and unto Sir Gawaine, and\r\nto all her sons, ye did yourself great shame when ye amongst you kept\r\nmy son in the kitchen and fed him like a poor hog. Fair sister, said\r\nKing Arthur, ye shall right well wit I knew him not, nor no more did\r\nSir Gawaine, nor his brethren; but sithen it is so, said the king, that\r\nhe is thus gone from us all, we must shape a remedy to find him. Also,\r\nsister, meseemeth ye might have done me to wit of his coming, and then\r\nan I had not done well to him ye might have blamed me. For when he came\r\nto this court he came leaning upon two men\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, as though he\r\nmight not have gone. And then he asked me three gifts; and one he asked\r\nthe same day, that was that I would give him meat enough that\r\ntwelvemonth; and the other two gifts he asked that day a twelvemonth,\r\nand that was that he might have the adventure of the damosel Linet, and\r\nthe third was that Sir Launcelot should make him knight when he desired\r\nhim. And so I granted him all his desire, and many in this court\r\nmarvelled that he desired his sustenance for a twelvemonth. And\r\nthereby, we deemed, many of us, that he was not come of a noble house.\r\n\r\nSir, said the Queen of Orkney unto King Arthur her brother, wit ye well\r\nthat I sent him unto you right well armed and horsed, and worshipfully\r\nbeseen of his body, and gold and silver plenty to spend. It may be,\r\nsaid the King, but thereof saw we none, save that same day as he\r\ndeparted from us, knights told me that there came a dwarf hither\r\nsuddenly, and brought him armour and a good horse full well and richly\r\nbeseen; and thereat we all had marvel from whence that riches came,\r\nthat we deemed all that he was come of men of worship. Brother, said\r\nthe queen, all that ye say I believe, for ever sithen he was grown he\r\nwas marvellously witted, and ever he was faithful and true of his\r\npromise. But I marvel, said she, that Sir Kay did mock him and scorn\r\nhim, and gave him that name Beaumains; yet, Sir Kay, said the queen,\r\nnamed him more righteously than he weened; for I dare say an he be\r\nalive, he is as fair an handed man and well disposed as any is living.\r\nSir, said Arthur, let this language be still, and by the grace of God\r\nhe shall be found an he be within this seven realms, and let all this\r\npass and be merry, for he is proved to be a man of worship, and that is\r\nmy joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. How King Arthur sent for the Lady Lionesse, and how she\r\nlet cry a tourney at her castle, whereas came many knights.\r\n\r\nThen said Sir Gawaine and his brethren unto Arthur, Sir, an ye will\r\ngive us leave, we will go and seek our brother. Nay, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, that shall ye not need; and so said Sir Baudwin of Britain:\r\nfor as by our advice the king shall send unto Dame Lionesse a\r\nmessenger, and pray her that she will come to the court in all the\r\nhaste that she may, and doubt ye not she will come; and then she may\r\ngive you best counsel where ye shall find him. This is well said of\r\nyou, said the king. So then goodly letters were made, and the messenger\r\nsent forth, that night and day he went till he came unto the Castle\r\nPerilous. And then the lady Dame Lionesse was sent for, thereas she was\r\nwith Sir Gringamore her brother and Sir Gareth. And when she understood\r\nthis message, she bade him ride on his way unto King Arthur, and she\r\nwould come after in all goodly haste. Then when she came to Sir\r\nGringamore and to Sir Gareth, she told them all how King Arthur had\r\nsent for her. That is because of me, said Sir Gareth. Now advise me,\r\nsaid Dame Lionesse, what shall I say, and in what manner I shall rule\r\nme. My lady and my love, said Sir Gareth, I pray you in no wise be ye\r\naknowen where I am; but well I wot my mother is there and all my\r\nbrethren, and they will take upon them to seek me, I wot well that they\r\ndo. But this, madam, I would ye said and advised the king when he\r\nquestioned with you of me. Then may ye say, this is your advice that,\r\nan it like his good grace, ye will do make a cry against the feast of\r\nthe Assumption of our Lady, that what knight there proveth him best he\r\nshall wield you and all your land. And if so be that he be a wedded\r\nman, that his wife shall have the degree, and a coronal of gold beset\r\nwith stones of virtue to the value of a thousand pound, and a white\r\ngerfalcon.\r\n\r\nSo Dame Lionesse departed and came to King Arthur, where she was nobly\r\nreceived, and there she was sore questioned of the king and of the\r\nQueen of Orkney. And she answered, where Sir Gareth was she could not\r\ntell. But thus much she said unto Arthur: Sir, I will let cry a\r\ntournament that shall be done before my castle at the Assumption of our\r\nLady, and the cry shall be this: that you, my lord Arthur, shall be\r\nthere, and your knights, and I will purvey that my knights shall be\r\nagainst yours; and then I am sure ye shall hear of Sir Gareth. This is\r\nwell advised, said King Arthur; and so she departed. And the king and\r\nshe made great provision to that tournament.\r\n\r\nWhen Dame Lionesse was come to the Isle of Avilion, that was the same\r\nisle thereas her brother Sir Gringamore dwelt, then she told them all\r\nhow she had done, and what promise she had made to King Arthur. Alas,\r\nsaid Sir Gareth, I have been so wounded with unhappiness sithen I came\r\ninto this castle that I shall not be able to do at that tournament like\r\na knight; for I was never thoroughly whole since I was hurt. Be ye of\r\ngood cheer, said the damosel Linet, for I undertake within these\r\nfifteen days to make ye whole, and as lusty as ever ye were. And then\r\nshe laid an ointment and a salve to him as it pleased to her, that he\r\nwas never so fresh nor so lusty. Then said the damosel Linet: Send you\r\nunto Sir Persant of Inde, and assummon him and his knights to be here\r\nwith you as they have promised. Also, that ye send unto Sir Ironside,\r\nthat is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and charge him that he be\r\nready with you with his whole sum of knights, and then shall ye be able\r\nto match with King Arthur and his knights. So this was done, and all\r\nknights were sent for unto the Castle Perilous; and then the Red Knight\r\nanswered and said unto Dame Lionesse, and to Sir Gareth, Madam, and my\r\nlord Sir Gareth, ye shall understand that I have been at the court of\r\nKing Arthur, and Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren, and there we\r\nhave done our homage as ye commanded us. Also Sir Ironside said, I have\r\ntaken upon me with Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren to hold part\r\nagainst my lord Sir Launcelot and the knights of that court. And this\r\nhave I done for the love of my lady Dame Lionesse, and you my lord Sir\r\nGareth. Ye have well done, said Sir Gareth; but wit you well ye shall\r\nbe full sore matched with the most noble knights of the world;\r\ntherefore we must purvey us of good knights, where we may get them.\r\nThat is well said, said Sir Persant, and worshipfully.\r\n\r\nAnd so the cry was made in England, Wales, and Scotland, Ireland,\r\nCornwall, and in all the Out Isles, and in Brittany and in many\r\ncountries; that at the feast of our Lady the Assumption next coming,\r\nmen should come to the Castle Perilous beside the Isle of Avilion; and\r\nthere all the knights that there came should have the choice whether\r\nthem list to be on the one party with the knights of the castle, or on\r\nthe other party with King Arthur. And two months was to the day that\r\nthe tournament should be. And so there came many good knights that were\r\nat their large, and held them for the most part against King Arthur and\r\nhis knights of the Round Table and came in the side of them of the\r\ncastle. For Sir Epinogrus was the first, and he was the king\xe2\x80\x99s son of\r\nNorthumberland, and Sir Palamides the Saracen was another, and Sir\r\nSafere his brother, and Sir Segwarides his brother, but they were\r\nchristened, and Sir Malegrine another, and Sir Brian de les Isles, a\r\nnoble knight, and Sir Grummore Grummursum, a good knight of Scotland,\r\nand Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, a noble knight, and Sir Turquine\r\nhis brother, and Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, two brethren, good knights\r\nof Cornwall. There came Sir Tristram de Liones, and with him Sir Dinas,\r\nthe Seneschal, and Sir Sadok; but this Sir Tristram was not at that\r\ntime knight of the Table Round, but he was one of the best knights of\r\nthe world. And so all these noble knights accompanied them with the\r\nlady of the castle, and with the Red Knight of the Red Launds; but as\r\nfor Sir Gareth, he would not take upon him more but as other mean\r\nknights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. How King Arthur went to the tournament with his knights,\r\nand how the lady received him worshipfully, and how the knights\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came with King Arthur Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris,\r\nhis brethren. And then his nephews Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and Sir\r\nAglovale, Sir Tor, Sir Percivale de Galis, and Sir Lamorak de Galis.\r\nThen came Sir Launcelot du Lake with his brethren, nephews, and\r\ncousins, as Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir\r\nGalihodin, Sir Galihud, and many more of Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and Sir\r\nDinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, his brother, a good knight, and Sir\r\nSagramore, a good knight; and all the most part of the Round Table.\r\nAlso there came with King Arthur these knights, the King of Ireland,\r\nKing Agwisance, and the King of Scotland, King Carados and King Uriens\r\nof the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus and his son Sir Meliaganus,\r\nand Sir Galahault the noble prince. All these kings, princes, and\r\nearls, barons, and other noble knights, as Sir Brandiles, Sir Uwaine\r\nles Avoutres, and Sir Kay, Sir Bedivere, Sir Meliot de Logres, Sir\r\nPetipase of Winchelsea, Sir Godelake: all these came with King Arthur,\r\nand more that cannot be rehearsed.\r\n\r\nNow leave we of these kings and knights, and let us speak of the great\r\narray that was made within the castle and about the castle for both\r\nparties. The Lady Dame Lionesse ordained great array upon her part for\r\nher noble knights, for all manner of lodging and victual that came by\r\nland and by water, that there lacked nothing for her party, nor for the\r\nother, but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for King\r\nArthur and his knights. And then there came the harbingers from King\r\nArthur for to harbour him, and his kings, dukes, earls, barons, and\r\nknights. And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lionesse and the Red Knight of\r\nthe Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother, and Sir Gringamore,\r\nthat in no wise there should none of them tell not his name, and make\r\nno more of him than of the least knight that there was, For, he said, I\r\nwill not be known of neither more nor less, neither at the beginning\r\nneither at the ending. Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth: Sir, I\r\nwill lend you a ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let\r\nme have it again when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseth\r\nmy beauty much more than it is of himself. And the virtue of my ring is\r\nthat, that is green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn\r\nin likeness to green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of\r\nwhite, and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it\r\nwill do of all manner of colours. Also who that beareth my ring shall\r\nlose no blood, and for great love I will give you this ring. Gramercy,\r\nsaid Sir Gareth, mine own lady, for this ring is passing meet for me,\r\nfor it will turn all manner of likeness that I am in, and that shall\r\ncause me that I shall not be known. Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth\r\na bay courser that was a passing good horse; also he gave him good\r\narmour and sure, and a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather won upon an heathen tyrant. And so thus every knight made him\r\nready to that tournament. And King Arthur was come two days to-fore the\r\nAssumption of our Lady. And there was all manner of royalty of all\r\nminstrelsy that might be found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the\r\nQueen of Orkney, Sir Gareth\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nAnd upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were done, there were\r\nheralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field. And so there came\r\nout Sir Epinogrus, the king\xe2\x80\x99s son of Northumberland, from the castle,\r\nand there encountered with him Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and either of\r\nthem brake their spears to their hands. And then came in Sir Palamides\r\nout of the castle, and there encountered with him Gawaine, and either\r\nof them smote other so hard that both the good knights and their horses\r\nfell to the earth. And then knights of either party rescued their\r\nknights. And then came in Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides, brethren to\r\nSir Palamides; and there encountered Sir Agravaine with Sir Safere and\r\nSir Gaheris encountered with Sir Segwarides. So Sir Safere smote down\r\nAgravaine, Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s brother; and Sir Segwarides, Sir Safere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother. And Sir Malegrine, a knight of the castle, encountered with\r\nSir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and there Sir Uwaine gave Sir Malegrine a\r\nfall, that he had almost broke his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How the knights bare them in the battle.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummursum, knights of the\r\ncastle, encountered with Sir Aglovale, and Sir Tor smote down Sir\r\nGrummore Grummursum to the earth. Then came in Sir Carados of the\r\ndolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle; and there\r\nencountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis,\r\nthat were two brethren. And there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir\r\nCarados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir\r\nTurquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other\xe2\x80\x99s horse\r\nand all to the earth, and either parties rescued other, and horsed them\r\nagain. And Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,\r\nencountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights\r\nencountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands. Then came\r\nin Sir Tristram, Sir Sadok, and Sir Dinas, knights of the castle, and\r\nthere encountered Sir Tristram with Sir Bedivere, and there Sir\r\nBedivere was smitten to the earth both horse and man. And Sir Sadok\r\nencountered with Sir Petipase, and there Sir Sadok was overthrown. And\r\nthere Uwaine les Avoutres smote down Sir Dinas, the Seneschal. Then\r\ncame in Sir Persant of Inde, a knight of the castle, and there\r\nencountered with him Sir Launcelot du Lake, and there he smote Sir\r\nPersant, horse and man, to the earth. Then came Sir Pertolepe from the\r\ncastle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel, and there Sir\r\nPertolepe, the Green Knight, smote down Sir Lionel, brother to Sir\r\nLauncelot. All this was marked by noble heralds, who bare him best, and\r\ntheir names.\r\n\r\nAnd then came into the field Sir Perimones, the Red Knight, Sir\r\nPersant\xe2\x80\x99s brother, that was a knight of the castle, and he encountered\r\nwith Sir Ector de Maris, and either smote other so hard that both their\r\nhorses and they fell to the earth. And then came in the Red Knight of\r\nthe Red Launds, and Sir Gareth, from the castle, and there encountered\r\nwith them Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Bleoberis, and there the Red Knight\r\nand Sir Bors [either] smote other so hard that their spears brast, and\r\ntheir horses fell grovelling to the earth. Then Sir Bleoberis brake his\r\nspear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleoberis fell to the\r\nearth. When Sir Galihodin saw that he bade Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir\r\nGareth smote him to the earth. Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge\r\nhis brother, and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him, and Sir\r\nDinadan and his brother, La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le\r\nDesirous, and Sir Dodinas le Savage. All these he bare down with one\r\nspear.\r\n\r\nWhen King Agwisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so, he marvelled\r\nwhat he might be that one time seemed green, and another time, at his\r\nagain coming, he seemed blue. And thus at every course that he rode to\r\nand fro he changed his colour, so that there might neither king nor\r\nknight have ready cognisance of him. Then Sir Agwisance, the King of\r\nIreland, encountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him\r\nfrom his horse, saddle and all. And then came King Carados of Scotland,\r\nand Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man. And in the same wise he\r\nserved King Uriens of the land of Gore. And then came in Sir\r\nBagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him down, horse and man, to the earth.\r\nAnd Bagdemagus\xe2\x80\x99 son, Meliganus, brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily\r\nand knightly. And then Sir Galahault, the noble prince, cried on high:\r\nKnight with the many colours, well hast thou jousted; now make thee\r\nready that I may joust with thee. Sir Gareth heard him, and he gat a\r\ngreat spear, and so they encountered together, and there the prince\r\nbrake his spear; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left side of the\r\nhelm that he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not his\r\nmen recovered him.\r\n\r\nSo God me help, said King Arthur, that same knight with the many\r\ncolours is a good knight. Wherefore the king called unto him Sir\r\nLauncelot, and prayed him to encounter with that knight. Sir, said\r\nLauncelot, I may well find in my heart for to forbear him as at this\r\ntime, for he hath had travail enough this day; and when a good knight\r\ndoth so well upon some day, it is no good knight\xe2\x80\x99s part to let him of\r\nhis worship, and namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great\r\nlabour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his quarrel is here this\r\nday, and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be\r\nhere; for I see well he paineth him and enforceth him to do great\r\ndeeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall\r\nhave the honour; though it lay in my power to put him from it I would\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. Yet of the said tournament.\r\n\r\nThen when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then there\r\nbegan a sore tournament. And there did Sir Lamorak marvellous deeds of\r\narms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir Ironside, that was the Red Knight\r\nof the Red Launds, there was strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palamides\r\nand Bleoberis there was a strong battle; and Sir Gawaine and Sir\r\nTristram met, and there Sir Gawaine had the worse, for he pulled Sir\r\nGawaine from his horse, and there he was long upon foot, and defouled.\r\nThen came in Sir Launcelot, and he smote Sir Turquine, and he him; and\r\nthen came Sir Carados his brother, and both at once they assailed him,\r\nand he as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with\r\nthem both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of Sir Launcelot. And\r\nthen came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was Sir Launcelot that fought\r\nwith the two perilous knights. And then Sir Gareth came with his good\r\nhorse and hurtled them in-sunder, and no stroke would he smite to Sir\r\nLauncelot. That espied Sir Launcelot, and deemed it should be the good\r\nknight Sir Gareth: and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and smote\r\non the right hand and on the left hand, and all the folk might well\r\nespy where that he rode. And by fortune he met with his brother Sir\r\nGawaine, and there he put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he put off his\r\nhelm, and so he served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all\r\nmen said he put him in the most pain, and best he did his devoir. For\r\nwhen Sir Tristram beheld him how he first jousted and after fought so\r\nwell with a sword, then he rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of\r\nInde, and asked them, by their faith, What manner a knight is yonder\r\nknight that seemeth in so many divers colours? Truly, meseemeth, said\r\nTristram, that he putteth himself in great pain, for he never ceaseth.\r\nWot ye not what he is? said Sir Ironside. No, said Sir Tristram. Then\r\nshall ye know that this is he that loveth the lady of the castle, and\r\nshe him again; and this is he that won me when I besieged the lady of\r\nthis castle, and this is he that won Sir Persant of Inde, and his three\r\nbrethren. What is his name, said Sir Tristram, and of what blood is he\r\ncome? He was called in the court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his\r\nright name is Sir Gareth of Orkney, brother to Sir Gawaine. By my head,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, he is a good knight, and a big man of arms, and if\r\nhe be young he shall prove a full noble knight. He is but a child, they\r\nall said, and of Sir Launcelot he was made knight. Therefore he is\r\nmickle the better, said Tristram. And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside,\r\nSir Persant, and his brother, rode together for to help Sir Gareth; and\r\nthen there were given many strong strokes.\r\n\r\nAnd then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm; and\r\nthen said his dwarf: Take me your ring, that ye lose it not while that\r\nye drink. And so when he had drunk he gat on his helm, and eagerly took\r\nhis horse and rode into the field, and left his ring with his dwarf;\r\nand the dwarf was glad the ring was from him, for then he wist well he\r\nshould be known. And then when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks\r\nsaw him well and plainly that he was in yellow colours; and there he\r\nrased off helms and pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel\r\nwhat knight he was, for the king saw by his hair that it was the same\r\nknight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. How Sir Gareth was espied by the heralds, and how he\r\nescaped out of the field.\r\n\r\nBut before he was in so many colours, and now he is but in one colour;\r\nthat is yellow. Now go, said King Arthur unto divers heralds, and ride\r\nabout him, and espy what manner knight he is, for I have spered of many\r\nknights this day that be upon his party, and all say they know him not.\r\n\r\nAnd so an herald rode nigh Gareth as he could; and there he saw written\r\nabout his helm in gold, This helm is Sir Gareth of Orkney.\r\n\r\nThen the herald cried as he were wood, and many heralds with him:\xe2\x80\x94This\r\nis Sir Gareth of Orkney in the yellow arms; that by all kings and\r\nknights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s beheld him and awaited; and then they pressed all\r\nto behold him, and ever the heralds cried: This is Sir Gareth of\r\nOrkney, King Lot\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sir Gareth espied that he was discovered, then he doubled his\r\nstrokes, and smote down Sir Sagramore, and his brother Sir Gawaine.\r\n\r\nO brother, said Sir Gawaine, I weened ye would not have stricken me.\r\n\r\nSo when he heard him say so he thrang here and there, and so with great\r\npain he gat out of the press, and there he met with his dwarf. O boy,\r\nsaid Sir Gareth, thou hast beguiled me foul this day that thou kept my\r\nring; give it me anon again, that I may hide my body withal; and so he\r\ntook it him. And then they all wist not where he was become; and Sir\r\nGawaine had in manner espied where Sir Gareth rode, and then he rode\r\nafter with all his might. That espied Sir Gareth, and rode lightly into\r\nthe forest, that Sir Gawaine wist not where he was become. And when Sir\r\nGareth wist that Sir Gawaine was passed, he asked the dwarf of best\r\ncounsel. Sir, said the dwarf, meseemeth it were best, now that ye are\r\nescaped from spying, that ye send my lady Dame Lionesse her ring. It is\r\nwell advised, said Sir Gareth; now have it here and bear it to her, and\r\nsay that I recommend me unto her good grace, and say her I will come\r\nwhen I may, and I pray her to be true and faithful to me as I will be\r\nto her. Sir, said the dwarf, it shall be done as ye command: and so he\r\nrode his way, and did his errand unto the lady. Then she said, Where is\r\nmy knight, Sir Gareth? Madam, said the dwarf, he bade me say that he\r\nwould not be long from you. And so lightly the dwarf came again unto\r\nSir Gareth, that would full fain have had a lodging, for he had need to\r\nbe reposed. And then fell there a thunder and a rain, as heaven and\r\nearth should go together. And Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for of\r\nall that day he had but little rest, neither his horse nor he. So this\r\nSir Gareth rode so long in that forest until the night came. And ever\r\nit lightened and thundered, as it had been wood. At the last by fortune\r\nhe came to a castle, and there he heard the waits upon the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Gareth came to a castle where he was well lodged,\r\nand he jousted with a knight and slew him.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Gareth rode unto the barbican of the castle, and prayed the\r\nporter fair to let him into the castle. The porter answered ungoodly\r\nagain, and said, Thou gettest no lodging here. Fair sir, say not so,\r\nfor I am a knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, and pray the lord or the lady of\r\nthis castle to give me harbour for the love of King Arthur. Then the\r\nporter went unto the duchess, and told her how there was a knight of\r\nKing Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s would have harbour. Let him in, said the duchess, for I\r\nwill see that knight, and for King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s sake he shall not be\r\nharbourless. Then she yode up into a tower over the gate, with great\r\ntorchlight.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Gareth saw that torch-light he cried on high: Whether thou be\r\nlord or lady, giant or champion, I take no force so that I may have\r\nharbour this night; and if it so be that I must needs fight, spare me\r\nnot to-morn when I have rested me, for both I and mine horse be weary.\r\nSir knight, said the lady, thou speakest knightly and boldly; but wit\r\nthou well the lord of this castle loveth not King Arthur, nor none of\r\nhis court, for my lord hath ever been against him; and therefore thou\r\nwere better not to come within this castle; for an thou come in this\r\nnight, thou must come in under such form, that wheresomever thou meet\r\nmy lord, by stigh or by street, thou must yield thee to him as\r\nprisoner. Madam, said Sir Gareth, what is your lord, and what is his\r\nname? Sir, my lord\xe2\x80\x99s name is the Duke de la Rowse. Well madam, said Sir\r\nGareth, I shall promise you in what place I meet your lord I shall\r\nyield me unto him and to his good grace; with that I understand he will\r\ndo me no harm: and if I understand that he will, I will release myself\r\nan I can with my spear and my sword. Ye say well, said the duchess; and\r\nthen she let the drawbridge down, and so he rode into the hall, and\r\nthere he alighted, and his horse was led into a stable; and in the hall\r\nhe unarmed him and said, Madam, I will not out of this hall this night;\r\nand when it is daylight, let see who will have ado with me, he shall\r\nfind me ready. Then was he set unto supper, and had many good dishes.\r\nThen Sir Gareth list well to eat, and knightly he ate his meat, and\r\neagerly; there was many a fair lady by him, and some said they never\r\nsaw a goodlier man nor so well of eating. Then they made him passing\r\ngood cheer, and shortly when he had supped his bed was made there; so\r\nhe rested him all night.\r\n\r\nAnd on the morn he heard mass, and brake his fast and took his leave at\r\nthe duchess, and at them all; and thanked her goodly of her lodging,\r\nand of his good cheer; and then she asked him his name. Madam, he said,\r\ntruly my name is Gareth of Orkney, and some men call me Beaumains. Then\r\nknew she well it was the same knight that fought for Dame Lionesse. So\r\nSir Gareth departed and rode up into a mountain, and there met him a\r\nknight, his name was Sir Bendelaine, and said to Sir Gareth: Thou shalt\r\nnot pass this way, for either thou shalt joust with me, or else be my\r\nprisoner. Then will I joust, said Sir Gareth. And so they let their\r\nhorses run, and there Sir Gareth smote him throughout the body; and Sir\r\nBendelaine rode forth to his castle there beside, and there died. So\r\nSir Gareth would have rested him, and he came riding to Bendelaine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncastle. Then his knights and servants espied that it was he that had\r\nslain their lord. Then they armed twenty good men, and came out and\r\nassailed Sir Gareth; and so he had no spear, but his sword, and put his\r\nshield afore him; and there they brake their spears upon him, and they\r\nassailed him passingly sore. But ever Sir Gareth defended him as a\r\nknight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Gareth fought with a knight that held within his\r\ncastle thirty ladies, and how he slew him.\r\n\r\nSo when they saw that they might not overcome him, they rode from him,\r\nand took their counsel to slay his horse; and so they came in upon Sir\r\nGareth, and with spears they slew his horse, and then they assailed him\r\nhard. But when he was on foot, there was none that he fought but he\r\ngave him such a buffet that he did never recover. So he slew them by\r\none and one till they were but four, and there they fled; and Sir\r\nGareth took a good horse that was one of theirs, and rode his way.\r\n\r\nThen he rode a great pace till that he came to a castle, and there he\r\nheard much mourning of ladies and gentlewomen. So there came by him a\r\npage. What noise is this, said Sir Gareth, that I hear within this\r\ncastle? Sir knight, said the page, here be within this castle thirty\r\nladies, and all they be widows; for here is a knight that waiteth daily\r\nupon this castle, and his name is the Brown Knight without Pity, and he\r\nis the periloust knight that now liveth; and therefore sir, said the\r\npage, I rede you flee. Nay, said Sir Gareth, I will not flee though\r\nthou be afeard of him. And then the page saw where came the Brown\r\nKnight: Lo, said the page, yonder he cometh. Let me deal with him, said\r\nSir Gareth. And when either of other had a sight they let their horses\r\nrun, and the Brown Knight brake his spear, and Sir Gareth smote him\r\nthroughout the body, that he overthrew him to the ground stark dead. So\r\nSir Gareth rode into the castle, and prayed the ladies that he might\r\nrepose him. Alas, said the ladies, ye may not be lodged here. Make him\r\ngood cheer, said the page, for this knight hath slain your enemy. Then\r\nthey all made him good cheer as lay in their power. But wit ye well\r\nthey made him good cheer, for they might none otherwise do, for they\r\nwere but poor.\r\n\r\nAnd so on the morn he went to mass, and there he saw the thirty ladies\r\nkneel, and lay grovelling upon divers tombs, making great dole and\r\nsorrow. Then Sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their lords.\r\nFair ladies, said Sir Gareth, ye must at the next feast of Pentecost be\r\nat the court of King Arthur, and say that I, Sir Gareth, sent you\r\nthither. We shall do this, said the ladies. So he departed, and by\r\nfortune he came to a mountain, and there he found a goodly knight that\r\nbade him, Abide sir knight, and joust with me. What are ye? said Sir\r\nGareth. My name is, said he, the Duke de la Rowse. Ah sir, ye are the\r\nsame knight that I lodged once in your castle; and there I made promise\r\nunto your lady that I should yield me unto you. Ah, said the duke, art\r\nthou that proud knight that profferest to fight with my knights;\r\ntherefore make thee ready, for I will have ado with you. So they let\r\ntheir horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote the duke down from his\r\nhorse. But the duke lightly avoided his horse, and dressed his shield\r\nand drew his sword, and bade Sir Gareth alight and fight with him. So\r\nhe did alight, and they did great battle together more than an hour,\r\nand either hurt other full sore. At the last Sir Gareth gat the duke to\r\nthe earth, and would have slain him, and then he yield him to him. Then\r\nmust ye go, said Sir Gareth, unto Sir Arthur my lord at the next feast,\r\nand say that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent you unto him. It shall be\r\ndone, said the duke, and I will do to you homage and fealty with an\r\nhundred knights with me; and all the days of my life to do you service\r\nwhere ye will command me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine fought each against\r\nother, and how they knew each other by the damosel Linet.\r\n\r\nSo the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there he\r\nsaw an armed knight coming toward him. Then Sir Gareth took the duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without biding they ran\r\ntogether as it had been the thunder. And there that knight hurt Sir\r\nGareth under the side with his spear. And then they alighted and drew\r\ntheir swords, and gave great strokes that the blood trailed to the\r\nground. And so they fought two hours.\r\n\r\nAt the last there came the damosel Linet, that some men called the\r\ndamosel Savage, and she came riding upon an ambling mule; and there she\r\ncried all on high, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave thy fighting with\r\nthy brother Sir Gareth.\r\n\r\nAnd when he heard her say so he threw away his shield and his sword,\r\nand ran to Sir Gareth, and took him in his arms, and sithen kneeled\r\ndown and asked him mercy.\r\n\r\nWhat are ye, said Sir Gareth, that right now were so strong and so\r\nmighty, and now so suddenly yield you to me? O Gareth, I am your\r\nbrother Sir Gawaine, that for your sake have had great sorrow and\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Gareth unlaced his helm, and kneeled down to him, and asked\r\nhim mercy. Then they rose both, and embraced either other in their\r\narms, and wept a great while or they might speak, and either of them\r\ngave other the prize of the battle. And there were many kind words\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nAlas, my fair brother, said Sir Gawaine, perdy I owe of right to\r\nworship you an ye were not my brother, for ye have worshipped King\r\nArthur and all his court, for ye have sent me more worshipful knights\r\nthis twelvemonth than six the best of the Round Table have done, except\r\nSir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nThen came the damosel Savage that was the Lady Linet, that rode with\r\nSir Gareth so long, and there she did staunch Sir Gareth\xe2\x80\x99s wounds and\r\nSir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s. Now what will ye do? said the damosel Savage; meseemeth\r\nthat it were well done that Arthur had witting of you both, for your\r\nhorses are so bruised that they may not bear. Now, fair damosel, said\r\nSir Gawaine, I pray you ride unto my lord mine uncle, King Arthur, and\r\ntell him what adventure is to me betid here, and I suppose he will not\r\ntarry long. Then she took her mule, and lightly she came to King Arthur\r\nthat was but two mile thence. And when she had told him tidings the\r\nking bade get him a palfrey. And when he was upon his back he bade the\r\nlords and ladies come after, who that would; and there was saddling and\r\nbridling of queens\xe2\x80\x99 horses and princes\xe2\x80\x99 horses, and well was him that\r\nsoonest might be ready.\r\n\r\nSo when the king came thereas they were, he saw Sir Gawaine and Sir\r\nGareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided his\r\nhorse. And when he came nigh Sir Gareth he would have spoken but he\r\nmight not; and therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness. And so\r\nthey stert unto their uncle, and required him of his good grace to be\r\nof good comfort. Wit ye well the king made great joy, and many a\r\npiteous complaint he made to Sir Gareth, and ever he wept as he had\r\nbeen a child. With that came his mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame\r\nMorgawse, and when she saw Sir Gareth readily in the visage she might\r\nnot weep, but suddenly fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great\r\nwhile like as she had been dead. And then Sir Gareth recomforted his\r\nmother in such wise that she recovered and made good cheer. Then the\r\nking commanded that all manner of knights that were under his\r\nobeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his\r\nnephews. And so it was done, and all manner of purveyance purveyed,\r\nthat there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame nor wild for\r\ngold or silver. And then by the means of the damosel Savage Sir Gawaine\r\nand Sir Gareth were healed of their wounds; and there they sojourned\r\neight days.\r\n\r\nThen said King Arthur unto the damosel Savage: I marvel that your\r\nsister, Dame Lionesse, cometh not here to me, and in especial that she\r\ncometh not to visit her knight, my nephew Sir Gareth, that hath had so\r\nmuch travail for her love. My lord, said the damosel Linet, ye must of\r\nyour good grace hold her excused, for she knoweth not that my lord, Sir\r\nGareth, is here. Go then for her, said King Arthur, that we may be\r\nappointed what is best to be done, according to the pleasure of my\r\nnephew. Sir, said the damosel, that shall be done, and so she rode unto\r\nher sister. And as lightly as she might she made her ready; and she\r\ncame on the morn with her brother Sir Gringamore, and with her forty\r\nknights. And so when she was come she had all the cheer that might be\r\ndone, both of the king, and of many other kings and queens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Gareth acknowledged that they loved each other\r\nto King Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding.\r\n\r\nAnd among all these ladies she was named the fairest, and peerless.\r\nThen when Sir Gawaine saw her there was many a goodly look and goodly\r\nwords, that all men of worship had joy to behold them. Then came King\r\nArthur and many other kings, and Dame Guenever, and the Queen of\r\nOrkney. And there the king asked his nephew, Sir Gareth, whether he\r\nwould have that lady as paramour, or to have her to his wife. My lord,\r\nwit you well that I love her above all ladies living. Now, fair lady,\r\nsaid King Arthur, what say ye? Most noble King, said Dame Lionesse, wit\r\nyou well that my lord, Sir Gareth, is to me more liefer to have and\r\nwield as my husband, than any king or prince that is christened; and if\r\nI may not have him I promise you I will never have none. For, my lord\r\nArthur, said Dame Lionesse, wit ye well he is my first love, and he\r\nshall be the last; and if ye will suffer him to have his will and free\r\nchoice I dare say he will have me. That is truth, said Sir Gareth; an I\r\nhave not you and wield not you as my wife, there shall never lady nor\r\ngentlewoman rejoice me. What, nephew, said the king, is the wind in\r\nthat door? for wit ye well I would not for the stint of my crown to be\r\ncauser to withdraw your hearts; and wit ye well ye cannot love so well\r\nbut I shall rather increase it than distress it. And also ye shall have\r\nmy love and my lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power.\r\nAnd in the same wise said Sir Gareth\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nThen there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas\r\nfollowing, at Kink Kenadon by the seaside, for there is a plentiful\r\ncountry. And so it was cried in all the places through the realm. And\r\nthen Sir Gareth sent his summons to all these knights and ladies that\r\nhe had won in battle to-fore, that they should be at his day of\r\nmarriage at Kink Kenadon by the sands.\r\n\r\nAnd then Dame Lionesse, and the damosel Linet with Sir Gringamore, rode\r\nto their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring she gave to Sir Gareth,\r\nand he gave her another. And King Arthur gave her a rich pair of bee of\r\ngold; and so she departed.\r\n\r\nAnd King Arthur and his fellowship rode toward Kink Kenadon, and Sir\r\nGareth brought his lady on the way, and so came to the king again and\r\nrode with him.\r\n\r\nLord! the great cheer that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he of\r\nhim, for there was never no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he\r\ndid Sir Launcelot; and ever for the most part he would be in Sir\r\nLauncelot\xe2\x80\x99s company; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconditions, he withdrew himself from his brother, Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nfellowship, for he was vengeable, and where he hated he would be\r\navenged with murder, and that hated Sir Gareth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. Of the Great Royalty, and what officers were made at the\r\nfeast of the wedding, and of the jousts at the feast.\r\n\r\nSo it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lionesse, the lady\r\nof the Castle Perilous, and her sister, Dame Linet, with Sir\r\nGringamore, her brother, with them for he had the conduct of these\r\nladies. And there they were lodged at the device of King Arthur. And\r\nupon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury made the wedding betwixt\r\nSir Gareth and the Lady Lionesse with great solemnity. And King Arthur\r\nmade Gaheris to wed the Damosel Savage, that was Dame Linet; and King\r\nArthur made Sir Agravaine to wed Dame Lionesse\xe2\x80\x99s niece, a fair lady,\r\nher name was Dame Laurel.\r\n\r\nAnd so when this solemnization was done, then came in the Green Knight,\r\nSir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he did homage and fealty\r\nto Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him for evermore. Also Sir\r\nPertolepe said: I pray you that at this feast I may be your\r\nchamberlain. With a good will, said Sir Gareth sith it liketh you to\r\ntake so simple an office. Then came in the Red Knight, with three score\r\nknights with him, and did to Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all\r\nthose knights to hold of him for evermore. And then this Sir Perimones\r\nprayed Sir Gareth to grant him to be his chief butler at that high\r\nfeast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have this office, and it\r\nwere better. Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred knights\r\nwith him, and there he did homage and fealty, and all his knights\r\nshould do him service, and hold their lands of him for ever; and there\r\nhe prayed Sir Gareth to make him his sewer-chief at the feast. I will\r\nwell, said Sir Gareth, that ye have it and it were better. Then came\r\nthe Duke de la Rowse with an hundred knights with him, and there he did\r\nhomage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and so to hold their lands of him for\r\never. And he required Sir Gareth that he might serve him of the wine\r\nthat day of that feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, and it were\r\nbetter. Then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, that was Sir\r\nIronside, and he brought with him three hundred knights, and there he\r\ndid homage and fealty, and all these knights to hold their lands of him\r\nfor ever. And then he asked Sir Gareth to be his carver. I will well,\r\nsaid Sir Gareth, an it please you.\r\n\r\nThen came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed widows, and\r\nthose thirty ladies brought with them many fair gentlewomen. And all\r\nthey kneeled down at once unto King Arthur and unto Sir Gareth, and\r\nthere all those ladies told the king how Sir Gareth delivered them from\r\nthe dolorous tower, and slew the Brown Knight without Pity: And\r\ntherefore we, and our heirs for evermore, will do homage unto Sir\r\nGareth of Orkney. So then the kings and queens, princes and earls,\r\nbarons and many bold knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there\r\nwere all manner of meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with\r\nall manner of minstrelsy that was used in those days. Also there was\r\ngreat jousts three days. But the king would not suffer Sir Gareth to\r\njoust, because of his new bride; for, as the French book saith, that\r\nDame Lionesse desired of the king that none that were wedded should\r\njoust at that feast.\r\n\r\nSo the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Galis, for he overthrew\r\nthirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of arms; and then\r\nKing Arthur made Sir Persant and his two brethren Knights of the Round\r\nTable to their lives\xe2\x80\x99 end, and gave them great lands. Also the second\r\nday there jousted Tristram best, and he overthrew forty knights, and\r\ndid there marvellous deeds of arms. And there King Arthur made\r\nIronside, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, a Knight of the\r\nTable Round to his life\xe2\x80\x99s end, and gave him great lands. The third day\r\nthere jousted Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he overthrew fifty knights,\r\nand did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on him.\r\nAnd there King Arthur made the Duke de la Rowse a Knight of the Round\r\nTable to his life\xe2\x80\x99s end, and gave him great lands to spend. But when\r\nthese jousts were done, Sir Lamorak and Sir Tristram departed suddenly,\r\nand would not be known, for the which King Arthur and all the court\r\nwere sore displeased. And so they held the court forty days with great\r\nsolemnity. And this Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a well-ruled,\r\nand fair-languaged.\r\n\r\nThus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that wedded Dame Lionesse\r\nof the Castle Perilous. And also Sir Gaheris wedded her sister, Dame\r\nLinet, that was called the Damosel Sabage. And Sir Agrabaine wedded\r\nDame Laurel, a fair lady and great, and mighty lands with great riches\r\ngave with them King Arthur, that royally they might live till their\r\nlives\xe2\x80\x99 end.\r\n\r\n Here followeth the viii. book, the which is the first book of Sir\r\n Tristram de Liones, and who was his father and his mother, and how he\r\n was born and fostered, and how he was made knight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Tristram de Liones was born, and how his mother died\r\nat his birth, wherefore she named him Tristram.\r\n\r\nIt was a king that hight Meliodas, and he was lord and king of the\r\ncountry of Liones, and this Meliodas was a likely knight as any was\r\nthat time living. And by fortune he wedded King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s sister of\r\nCornwall, and she was called Elizabeth, that was called both good and\r\nfair. And at that time King Arthur reigned, and he was whole king of\r\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland, and of many other realms: howbeit there\r\nwere many kings that were lords of many countries, but all they held\r\ntheir lands of King Arthur; for in Wales were two kings, and in the\r\nnorth were many kings; and in Cornwall and in the west were two kings;\r\nalso in Ireland were two or three kings, and all were under the\r\nobeissance of King Arthur. So was the King of France, and the King of\r\nBrittany, and all the lordships unto Rome.\r\n\r\nSo when this King Meliodas had been with his wife, within a while she\r\nwaxed great with child, and she was a full meek lady, and well she\r\nloved her lord, and he her again, so there was great joy betwixt them.\r\nThen there was a lady in that country that had loved King Meliodas\r\nlong, and by no mean she never could get his love; therefore she let\r\nordain upon a day, as King Meliodas rode a-hunting, for he was a great\r\nchaser, and there by an enchantment she made him chase an hart by\r\nhimself alone till that he came to an old castle, and there anon he was\r\ntaken prisoner by the lady that him loved. When Elizabeth, King\r\nMeliodas\xe2\x80\x99 wife, missed her lord, and she was nigh out of her wit, and\r\nalso as great with child as she was, she took a gentlewoman with her,\r\nand ran into the forest to seek her lord. And when she was far in the\r\nforest she might no farther, for she began to travail fast of her\r\nchild. And she had many grimly throes; her gentlewoman helped her all\r\nthat she might, and so by miracle of Our Lady of Heaven she was\r\ndelivered with great pains. But she had taken such cold for the default\r\nof help that deep draughts of death took her, that needs she must die\r\nand depart out of this world; there was none other bote.\r\n\r\nAnd when this Queen Elizabeth saw that there was none other bote, then\r\nshe made great dole, and said unto her gentlewoman: When ye see my\r\nlord, King Meliodas, recommend me unto him, and tell him what pains I\r\nendure here for his love, and how I must die here for his sake for\r\ndefault of good help; and let him wit that I am full sorry to depart\r\nout of this world from him, therefore pray him to be friend to my soul.\r\nNow let me see my little child, for whom I have had all this sorrow.\r\nAnd when she saw him she said thus: Ah, my little son, thou hast\r\nmurdered thy mother, and therefore I suppose, thou that art a murderer\r\nso young, thou art full likely to be a manly man in thine age. And\r\nbecause I shall die of the birth of thee, I charge thee, gentlewoman,\r\nthat thou pray my lord, King Meliodas, that when he is christened let\r\ncall him Tristram, that is as much to say as a sorrowful birth. And\r\ntherewith this queen gave up the ghost and died. Then the gentlewoman\r\nlaid her under an umbre of a great tree, and then she lapped the child\r\nas well as she might for cold. Right so there came the barons,\r\nfollowing after the queen, and when they saw that she was dead, and\r\nunderstood none other but the king was destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How the stepmother of Sir Tristram had ordained poison for\r\nto have poisoned Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nThen certain of them would have slain the child, because they would\r\nhave been lords of the country of Liones. But then through the fair\r\nspeech of the gentlewoman, and by the means that she made, the most\r\npart of the barons would not assent thereto. And then they let carry\r\nhome the dead queen, and much dole was made for her.\r\n\r\nThen this meanwhile Merlin delivered King Meliodas out of prison on the\r\nmorn after his queen was dead. And so when the king was come home the\r\nmost part of the barons made great joy. But the sorrow that the king\r\nmade for his queen that might no tongue tell. So then the king let\r\ninter her richly, and after he let christen his child as his wife had\r\ncommanded afore her death. And then he let call him Tristram, the\r\nsorrowful born child. Then the King Meliodas endured seven years\r\nwithout a wife, and all this time Tristram was nourished well. Then it\r\nbefell that King Meliodas wedded King Howell\xe2\x80\x99s daughter of Brittany,\r\nand anon she had children of King Meliodas: then was she heavy and\r\nwroth that her children should not rejoice the country of Liones,\r\nwherefore this queen ordained for to poison young Tristram. So she let\r\npoison be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas Tristram and\r\nher children were together, unto that intent that when Tristram were\r\nthirsty he should drink that drink. And so it fell upon a day, the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s son, as he was in that chamber, espied the piece with poison,\r\nand he weened it had been good drink, and because the child was thirsty\r\nhe took the piece with poison and drank freely; and therewithal\r\nsuddenly the child brast and was dead.\r\n\r\nWhen the queen of Meliodas wist of the death of her son, wit ye well\r\nthat she was heavy. But yet the king understood nothing of her treason.\r\nNotwithstanding the queen would not leave this, but eft she let ordain\r\nmore poison, and put it in a piece. And by fortune King Meliodas, her\r\nhusband, found the piece with wine where was the poison, and he that\r\nwas much thirsty took the piece for to drink thereout. And as he would\r\nhave drunken thereof the queen espied him, and then she ran unto him,\r\nand pulled the piece from him suddenly. The king marvelled why she did\r\nso, and remembered him how her son was suddenly slain with poison. And\r\nthen he took her by the hand, and said: Thou false traitress, thou\r\nshalt tell me what manner of drink this is, or else I shall slay thee.\r\nAnd therewith he pulled out his sword, and sware a great oath that he\r\nshould slay her but if she told him truth. Ah! mercy, my lord, said\r\nshe, and I shall tell you all. And then she told him why she would have\r\nslain Tristram, because her children should rejoice his land. Well,\r\nsaid King Meliodas, and therefore shall ye have the law. And so she was\r\ncondemned by the assent of the barons to be burnt; and then was there\r\nmade a great fire, and right as she was at the fire to take her\r\nexecution, young Tristram kneeled afore King Meliodas, and besought him\r\nto give him a boon. I will well, said the king again. Then said young\r\nTristram, Give me the life of thy queen, my stepmother. That is\r\nunrightfully asked, said King Meliodas, for thou ought of right to hate\r\nher, for she would have slain thee with that poison an she might have\r\nhad her will; and for thy sake most is my cause that she should die.\r\n\r\nSir, said Tristram, as for that, I beseech you of your mercy that you\r\nwill forgive it her, and as for my part, God forgive it her, and I do;\r\nand so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon, for God\xe2\x80\x99s love\r\nI require you hold your promise. Sithen it is so, said the king, I will\r\nthat ye have her life. Then, said the king, I give her to you, and go\r\nye to the fire and take her, and do with her what ye will. So Sir\r\nTristram went to the fire, and by the commandment of the king delivered\r\nher from the death. But after that King Meliodas would never have ado\r\nwith her, as at bed and board. But by the good means of young Tristram\r\nhe made the king and her accorded. But then the king would not suffer\r\nyoung Tristram to abide no longer in his court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Tristram was sent into France, and had one to\r\ngovern him named Gouvernail, and how he learned to harp, hawk, and\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\nAnd then he let ordain a gentleman that was well learned and taught,\r\nhis name was Gouvernail; and then he sent young Tristram with\r\nGouvernail into France to learn the language, and nurture, and deeds of\r\narms. And there was Tristram more than seven years. And then when he\r\nwell could speak the language, and had learned all that he might learn\r\nin that country, then he came home to his father, King Meliodas, again.\r\nAnd so Tristram learned to be an harper passing all other, that there\r\nwas none such called in no country, and so on harping and on\r\ninstruments of music he applied him in his youth for to learn.\r\n\r\nAnd after, as he grew in might and strength, he laboured ever in\r\nhunting and in hawking, so that never gentleman more, that ever we\r\nheard read of. And as the book saith, he began good measures of blowing\r\nof beasts of venery, and beasts of chase, and all manner of vermin, and\r\nall these terms we have yet of hawking and hunting. And therefore the\r\nbook of venery, of hawking, and hunting, is called the book of Sir\r\nTristram. Wherefore, as meseemeth, all gentlemen that bear old arms\r\nought of right to honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that\r\ngentlemen have and use, and shall to the day of doom, that thereby in a\r\nmanner all men of worship may dissever a gentleman from a yeoman, and\r\nfrom a yeoman a villain. For he that gentle is will draw him unto\r\ngentle tatches, and to follow the customs of noble gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThus Sir Tristram endured in Cornwall until he was big and strong, of\r\nthe age of eighteen years. And then the King Meliodas had great joy of\r\nSir Tristram, and so had the queen, his wife. For ever after in her\r\nlife, because Sir Tristram saved her from the fire, she did never hate\r\nhim more after, but loved him ever after, and gave Tristram many great\r\ngifts; for every estate loved him, where that he went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Marhaus came out of Ireland for to ask truage of\r\nCornwall, or else he would fight therefore.\r\n\r\nThen it befell that King Anguish of Ireland sent unto King Mark of\r\nCornwall for his truage, that Cornwall had paid many winters. And all\r\nthat time King Mark was behind of the truage for seven years. And King\r\nMark and his barons gave unto the messenger of Ireland these words and\r\nanswer, that they would none pay; and bade the messenger go unto his\r\nKing Anguish, and tell him we will pay him no truage, but tell your\r\nlord, an he will always have truage of us of Cornwall, bid him send a\r\ntrusty knight of his land, that will fight for his right, and we shall\r\nfind another for to defend our right. With this answer the messengers\r\ndeparted into Ireland. And when King Anguish understood the answer of\r\nthe messengers he was wonderly wroth. And then he called unto him Sir\r\nMarhaus, the good knight, that was nobly proved, and a Knight of the\r\nTable Round. And this Marhaus was brother unto the queen of Ireland.\r\nThen the king said thus: Fair brother, Sir Marhaus, I pray you go into\r\nCornwall for my sake, and do battle for our truage that of right we\r\nought to have; and whatsomever ye spend ye shall have sufficiently,\r\nmore than ye shall need. Sir, said Marhaus, wit ye well that I shall\r\nnot be loath to do battle in the right of you and your land with the\r\nbest knight of the Table Round; for I know them, for the most part,\r\nwhat be their deeds; and for to advance my deeds and to increase my\r\nworship I will right gladly go unto this journey for our right.\r\n\r\nSo in all haste there was made purveyance for Sir Marhaus, and he had\r\nall things that to him needed; and so he departed out of Ireland, and\r\narrived up in Cornwall even fast by the Castle of Tintagil. And when\r\nKing Mark understood that he was there arrived to fight for Ireland,\r\nthen made King Mark great sorrow when he understood that the good and\r\nnoble knight Sir Marhaus was come. For they knew no knight that durst\r\nhave ado with him. For at that time Sir Marhaus was called one of the\r\nfamousest and renowned knights of the world. And thus Sir Marhaus abode\r\nin the sea, and every day he sent unto King Mark for to pay the truage\r\nthat was behind of seven year, other else to find a knight to fight\r\nwith him for the truage. This manner of message Sir Marhaus sent daily\r\nunto King Mark.\r\n\r\nThen they of Cornwall let make cries in every place, that what knight\r\nwould fight for to save the truage of Cornwall, he should be rewarded\r\nso that he should fare the better, term of his life. Then some of the\r\nbarons said to King Mark, and counselled him to send to the court of\r\nKing Arthur for to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, that was that time named\r\nfor the marvelloust knight of all the world. Then there were some other\r\nbarons that counselled the king not to do so, and said that it was\r\nlabour in vain, because Sir Marhaus was a knight of the Round Table,\r\ntherefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other, but if it\r\nwere any knight at his own request would fight disguised and unknown.\r\nSo the king and all his barons assented that it was no bote to seek any\r\nknight of the Round Table. This mean while came the language and the\r\nnoise unto King Meliodas, how that Sir Marhaus abode battle fast by\r\nTintagil, and how King Mark could find no manner knight to fight for\r\nhim. When young Tristram heard of this he was wroth, and sore ashamed\r\nthat there durst no knight in Cornwall have ado with Sir Marhaus of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage\r\nof Cornwall, and how he was made knight.\r\n\r\nTherewithal Tristram went unto his father, King Meliodas, and asked him\r\ncounsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall from truage. For,\r\nas meseemeth, said Sir Tristram, it were shame that Sir Marhaus, the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s brother of Ireland, should go away unless that he were foughten\r\nwithal. As for that, said King Meliodas, wit you well, son Tristram,\r\nthat Sir Marhaus is called one of the best knights of the world, and\r\nKnight of the Table Round; and therefore I know no knight in this\r\ncountry that is able to match with him. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that I\r\nam not made knight; and if Sir Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland,\r\nGod let me never have worship: an I were made knight I should match\r\nhim. And sir, said Tristram, I pray you give me leave to ride to King\r\nMark; and, so ye be not displeased, of King Mark will I be made knight.\r\nI will well, said King Meliodas, that ye be ruled as your courage will\r\nrule you. Then Sir Tristram thanked his father much. And then he made\r\nhim ready to ride into Cornwall.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from King\r\nFaramon of France\xe2\x80\x99s daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were full piteous\r\nletters, and in them were written many complaints of love; but Sir\r\nTristram had no joy of her letters nor regard unto her. Also she sent\r\nhim a little brachet that was passing fair. But when the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter understood that Sir Tristram would not love her, as the book\r\nsaith, she died for sorrow. And then the same squire that brought the\r\nletter and the brachet came again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall\r\nhear in the tale.\r\n\r\nSo this young Sir Tristram rode unto his eme, King Mark of Cornwall.\r\nAnd when he came there he heard say that there would no knight fight\r\nwith Sir Marhaus. Then yede Sir Tristram unto his eme and said: Sir, if\r\nye will give me the order of knighthood, I will do battle with Sir\r\nMarhaus. What are ye, said the king, and from whence be ye come? Sir,\r\nsaid Tristram, I come from King Meliodas that wedded your sister, and a\r\ngentleman wit ye well I am. King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that\r\nhe was but a young man of age, but he was passingly well made and big.\r\nFair sir, said the king, what is your name, and where were ye born?\r\nSir, said he again, my name is Tristram, and in the country of Liones\r\nwas I born. Ye say well, said the king; and if ye will do this battle I\r\nshall make you knight. Therefore I come to you, said Sir Tristram, and\r\nfor none other cause. But then King Mark made him knight. And\r\ntherewithal, anon as he had made him knight, he sent a messenger unto\r\nSir Marhaus with letters that said that he had found a young knight\r\nready for to take the battle to the uttermost. It may well be, said Sir\r\nMarhaus; but tell King Mark I will not fight with no knight but he be\r\nof blood royal, that is to say, other king\xe2\x80\x99s son, other queen\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\nborn of a prince or princess.\r\n\r\nWhen King Mark understood that, he sent for Sir Tristram de Liones and\r\ntold him what was the answer of Sir Marhaus. Then said Sir Tristram:\r\nSithen that he saith so, let him wit that I am come of father side and\r\nmother side of as noble blood as he is: for, sir, now shall ye know\r\nthat I am King Meliodas\xe2\x80\x99 son, born of your own sister, Dame Elizabeth,\r\nthat died in the forest in the birth of me. O Jesu, said King Mark, ye\r\nare welcome fair nephew to me. Then in all the haste the king let horse\r\nSir Tristram, and armed him in the best manner that might be had or\r\ngotten for gold or silver. And then King Mark sent unto Sir Marhaus,\r\nand did him to wit that a better born man than he was himself should\r\nfight with him, and his name is Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King\r\nMeliodas, and born of King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Then was Sir Marhaus glad and\r\nblithe that he should fight with such a gentleman. And so by the assent\r\nof King Mark and of Sir Marhaus they let ordain that they should fight\r\nwithin an island nigh Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 ships; and so was Sir Tristram put\r\ninto a vessel both his horse and he, and all that to him longed both\r\nfor his body and for his horse. Sir Tristram lacked nothing. And when\r\nKing Mark and his barons of Cornwall beheld how young Sir Tristram\r\ndeparted with such a carriage to fight for the right of Cornwall, there\r\nwas neither man nor woman of worship but they wept to see and\r\nunderstand so young a knight to jeopardy himself for their right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Tristram arrived into the Island for to furnish the\r\nbattle with Sir Marhaus.\r\n\r\nSo to shorten this tale, when Sir Tristram was arrived within the\r\nisland he looked to the farther side, and there he saw at an anchor six\r\nships nigh to the land; and under the shadow of the ships upon the\r\nland, there hoved the noble knight, Sir Marhaus of Ireland. Then Sir\r\nTristram commanded his servant Gouvernail to bring his horse to the\r\nland, and dress his harness at all manner of rights. And then when he\r\nhad so done he mounted upon his horse; and when he was in his saddle\r\nwell apparelled, and his shield dressed upon his shoulder, Tristram\r\nasked Gouvernail, Where is this knight that I shall have ado withal?\r\nSir, said Gouvernail, see ye him not? I weened ye had seen him; yonder\r\nhe hoveth under the umbre of his ships on horseback, with his spear in\r\nhis hand and his shield upon his shoulder. That is truth, said the\r\nnoble knight, Sir Tristram, now I see him well enough.\r\n\r\nThen he commanded his servant Gouvernail to go to his vessel again: And\r\ncommend me unto mine eme King Mark, and pray him, if that I be slain in\r\nthis battle, for to inter my body as him seemed best; and as for me,\r\nlet him wit that I will never yield me for cowardice; and if I be slain\r\nand flee not, then they have lost no truage for me; and if so be that I\r\nflee or yield me as recreant, bid mine eme never bury me in Christian\r\nburials. And upon thy life, said Sir Tristram to Gouvernail, come thou\r\nnot nigh this island till that thou see me overcome or slain, or else\r\nthat I win yonder knight. So either departed from other sore weeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Tristram fought against Sir Marhaus and achieved\r\nhis battle, and how Sir Marhaus fled to his ship.\r\n\r\nAnd then Sir Marhaus avised Sir Tristram, and said thus: Young knight,\r\nSir Tristram, what dost thou here? me sore repenteth of thy courage,\r\nfor wit thou well I have been assayed, and the best knights of this\r\nland have been assayed of my hand; and also I have matched with the\r\nbest knights of the world, and therefore by my counsel return again\r\nunto thy vessel. And fair knight, and well-proved knight, said Sir\r\nTristram, thou shalt well wit I may not forsake thee in this quarrel,\r\nfor I am for thy sake made knight. And thou shalt well wit that I am a\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s son born, and gotten upon a queen; and such promise I have made\r\nat my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s request and mine own seeking, that I shall fight with\r\nthee unto the uttermost, and deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And\r\nalso wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that this is the greatest cause that\r\nthou couragest me to have ado with thee, for thou art called one of the\r\nmost renowned knights of the world, and because of that noise and fame\r\nthat thou hast thou givest me courage to have ado with thee, for never\r\nyet was I proved with good knight; and sithen I took the order of\r\nknighthood this day, I am well pleased that I may have ado with so good\r\na knight as thou art. And now wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that I cast\r\nme to get worship on thy body; and if that I be not proved, I trust to\r\nGod that I shall be worshipfully proved upon thy body, and to deliver\r\nthe country of Cornwall for ever from all manner of truage from Ireland\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Marhaus had heard him say what he would, he said then thus\r\nagain: Fair knight, sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of\r\nme, I let thee wit worship may thou none lose by me if thou mayest\r\nstand me three strokes; for I let thee wit for my noble deeds, proved\r\nand seen, King Arthur made me Knight of the Table Round.\r\n\r\nThen they began to feutre their spears, and they met so fiercely\r\ntogether that they smote either other down, both horse and all. But Sir\r\nMarhaus smote Sir Tristram a great wound in the side with his spear,\r\nand then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and\r\nthrew their shields afore them. And then they lashed together as men\r\nthat were wild and courageous. And when they had stricken so together\r\nlong, then they left their strokes, and foined at their breaths and\r\nvisors; and when they saw that that might not prevail them, then they\r\nhurtled together like rams to bear either other down. Thus they fought\r\nstill more than half a day, and either were wounded passing sore, that\r\nthe blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground. By then Sir\r\nTristram waxed more fresher than Sir Marhaus, and better winded and\r\nbigger; and with a mighty stroke he smote Sir Marhaus upon the helm\r\nsuch a buffet that it went through his helm, and through the coif of\r\nsteel, and through the brain-pan, and the sword stuck so fast in the\r\nhelm and in his brain-pan that Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his sword\r\nor ever he might pull it out from his head; and there Marhaus fell down\r\non his knees, the edge of Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s sword left in his brain-pan. And\r\nsuddenly Sir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his sword and his\r\nshield from him, and so ran to his ships and fled his way, and Sir\r\nTristram had ever his shield and his sword.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him, he said: Ah! Sir\r\nKnight of the Round Table, why withdrawest thou thee? thou dost thyself\r\nand thy kin great shame, for I am but a young knight, or now I was\r\nnever proved, and rather than I should withdraw me from thee, I had\r\nrather be hewn in an hundred pieces. Sir Marhaus answered no word but\r\nyede his way sore groaning. Well, Sir Knight, said Sir Tristram, I\r\npromise thee thy sword and thy shield shall be mine; and thy shield\r\nshall I wear in all places where I ride on mine adventures, and in the\r\nsight of King Arthur and all the Round Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Marhaus after that he was arrived in Ireland died\r\nof the stroke that Sir Tristram had given him, and how Tristram was\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nAnon Sir Marhaus and his fellowship departed into Ireland. And as soon\r\nas he came to the king, his brother, he let search his wounds. And when\r\nhis head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s sword was found\r\ntherein, and might never be had out of his head for no surgeons, and so\r\nhe died of Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s sword; and that piece of the sword the queen,\r\nhis sister, kept it for ever with her, for she thought to be revenged\r\nan she might.\r\n\r\nNow turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and full\r\nsore bled that he might not within a little while, when he had taken\r\ncold, unnethe stir him of his limbs. And then he set him down softly\r\nupon a little hill, and bled fast. Then anon came Gouvernail, his man,\r\nwith his vessel; and the king and his barons came with procession\r\nagainst him. And when he was come unto the land, King Mark took him in\r\nhis arms, and the king and Sir Dinas, the seneschal, led Sir Tristram\r\ninto the castle of Tintagil. And then was he searched in the best\r\nmanner, and laid in his bed. And when King Mark saw his wounds he wept\r\nheartily, and so did all his lords. So God me help, said King Mark, I\r\nwould not for all my lands that my nephew died. So Sir Tristram lay\r\nthere a month and more, and ever he was like to die of that stroke that\r\nSir Marhaus smote him first with the spear. For, as the French book\r\nsaith, the spear\xe2\x80\x99s head was envenomed, that Sir Tristram might not be\r\nwhole. Then was King Mark and all his barons passing heavy, for they\r\ndeemed none other but that Sir Tristram should not recover. Then the\r\nking let send after all manner of leeches and surgeons, both unto men\r\nand women, and there was none that would behote him the life. Then came\r\nthere a lady that was a right wise lady, and she said plainly unto King\r\nMark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his barons, that he should never\r\nbe whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country that the venom\r\ncame from, and in that country should he be holpen or else never. Thus\r\nsaid the lady unto the king.\r\n\r\nWhen King Mark understood that, he let purvey for Sir Tristram a fair\r\nvessel, well victualled, and therein was put Sir Tristram, and\r\nGouvernail with him, and Sir Tristram took his harp with him, and so he\r\nwas put into the sea to sail into Ireland; and so by good fortune he\r\narrived up in Ireland, even fast by a castle where the king and the\r\nqueen was; and at his arrival he sat and harped in his bed a merry lay,\r\nsuch one heard they never none in Ireland before that time.\r\n\r\nAnd when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that was\r\nsuch an harper, anon the king sent for him, and let search his wounds,\r\nand then asked him his name. Then he answered, I am of the country of\r\nLiones, and my name is Tramtrist, that thus was wounded in a battle as\r\nI fought for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s right. So God me help, said King Anguish, ye\r\nshall have all the help in this land that ye may have here; but I let\r\nyou wit, in Cornwall I had a great loss as ever had king, for there I\r\nlost the best knight of the world; his name was Marhaus, a full noble\r\nknight, and Knight of the Table Round; and there he told Sir Tristram\r\nwherefore Sir Marhaus was slain. Sir Tristram made semblant as he had\r\nbeen sorry, and better knew he how it was than the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale Isoud\r\nfirst for to be healed of his wound.\r\n\r\nThen the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s ward and keeping, because she was a noble surgeon. And when\r\nshe had searched him she found in the bottom of his wound that therein\r\nwas poison, and so she healed him within a while; and therefore\r\nTramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud, for she was at that time\r\nthe fairest maid and lady of the world. And there Tramtrist learned her\r\nto harp, and she began to have a great fantasy unto him. And at that\r\ntime Sir Palamides, the Saracen, was in that country, and well\r\ncherished with the king and the queen. And every day Sir Palamides drew\r\nunto La Beale Isoud and proffered her many gifts, for he loved her\r\npassingly well. All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he Sir\r\nPalamides for a noble knight and a mighty man. And wit you well Sir\r\nTramtrist had great despite at Sir Palamides, for La Beale Isoud told\r\nTramtrist that Palamides was in will to be christened for her sake.\r\nThus was there great envy betwixt Tramtrist and Sir Palamides.\r\n\r\nThen it befell that King Anguish let cry a great jousts and a great\r\ntournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the Launds, and she\r\nwas nigh cousin unto the king. And what man won her, three days after\r\nhe should wed her and have all her lands. This cry was made in England,\r\nWales, Scotland, and also in France and in Brittany. It befell upon a\r\nday La Beale Isoud came unto Sir Tramtrist, and told him of this\r\ntournament. He answered and said: Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight,\r\nand but late I had been dead had not your good ladyship been. Now, fair\r\nlady, what would ye I should do in this matter? well ye wot, my lady,\r\nthat I may not joust. Ah, Tramtrist, said La Beale Isoud, why will ye\r\nnot have ado at that tournament? well I wot Sir Palamides shall be\r\nthere, and to do what he may; and therefore Tramtrist, I pray you for\r\nto be there, for else Sir Palamides is like to win the degree. Madam,\r\nsaid Tramtrist, as for that, it may be so, for he is a proved knight,\r\nand I am but a young knight and late made; and the first battle that I\r\ndid it mishapped me to be sore wounded as ye see. But an I wist ye\r\nwould be my better lady, at that tournament I will be, so that ye will\r\nkeep my counsel and let no creature have knowledge that I shall joust\r\nbut yourself, and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor person\r\nshall I jeopard there for your sake, that, peradventure, Sir Palamides\r\nshall know when that I come. Thereto, said La Beale Isoud, do your\r\nbest, and as I can, said La Beale Isoud, I shall purvey horse and\r\narmour for you at my device. As ye will so be it, said Sir Tramtrist, I\r\nwill be at your commandment.\r\n\r\nSo at the day of jousts there came Sir Palamides with a black shield,\r\nand he overthrew many knights, that all the people had marvel of him.\r\nFor he put to the worse Sir Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravaine, Bagdemagus,\r\nKay, Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and\r\nGriflet le Fise de Dieu. All these the first day Sir Palamides struck\r\ndown to the earth. And then all manner of knights were adread of Sir\r\nPalamides, and many called him the Knight with the Black Shield. So\r\nthat day Sir Palamides had great worship.\r\n\r\nThen came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would not\r\njoust. Sir, he said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not\r\nadventure me. Then came there the same squire that was sent from the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s daughter of France unto Sir Tristram. And when he had espied Sir\r\nTristram he fell flat to his feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what\r\ncourtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram. And therewithal suddenly\r\nSir Tristram ran unto his squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and\r\nprayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name. Sir, said Hebes, I\r\nwill not discover your name but if ye command me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Tristram won the degree at a tournament in Ireland,\r\nand there made Palamides to bear no more harness in a year.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram asked him what he did in those countries. Sir, he\r\nsaid, I came hither with Sir Gawaine for to be made knight, and if it\r\nplease you, of your hands that I may be made knight. Await upon me as\r\nto-morn secretly, and in the field I shall make you a knight.\r\n\r\nThen had La Beale Isoud great suspicion unto Tramtrist, that he was\r\nsome man of worship proved, and therewith she comforted herself, and\r\ncast more love unto him than she had done to-fore. And so on the morn\r\nSir Palamides made him ready to come into the field as he did the first\r\nday. And there he smote down the King with the Hundred Knights, and the\r\nKing of Scots. Then had La Beale Isoud ordained and well arrayed Sir\r\nTristram in white horse and harness. And right so she let put him out\r\nat a privy postern, and so he came into the field as it had been a\r\nbright angel. And anon Sir Palamides espied him, and therewith he\r\nfeutred a spear unto Sir Tramtrist, and he again unto him. And there\r\nSir Tristram smote down Sir Palamides unto the earth. And then there\r\nwas a great noise of people: some said Sir Palamides had a fall, some\r\nsaid the Knight with the Black Shield had a fall. And wit you well La\r\nBeale Isoud was passing glad. And then Sir Gawaine and his fellows nine\r\nhad marvel what knight it might be that had smitten down Sir Palamides.\r\nThen would there none joust with Tramtrist, but all that there were\r\nforsook him, most and least. Then Sir Tristram made Hebes a knight, and\r\ncaused him to put himself forth, and did right well that day. So after\r\nSir Hebes held him with Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sir Palamides had received this fall, wit ye well that he was\r\nsore ashamed, and as privily as he might he withdrew him out of the\r\nfield. All that espied Sir Tristram, and lightly he rode after Sir\r\nPalamides and overtook him, and bade him turn, for better he would\r\nassay him or ever he departed. Then Sir Palamides turned him, and\r\neither lashed at other with their swords. But at the first stroke Sir\r\nTristram smote down Palamides, and gave him such a stroke upon the head\r\nthat he fell to the earth. So then Tristram bade yield him, and do his\r\ncommandment, or else he would slay him. When Sir Palamides beheld his\r\ncountenance, he dread his buffets so, that he granted all his askings.\r\nWell said, said Sir Tristram, this shall be your charge. First, upon\r\npain of your life that ye forsake my lady La Beale Isoud, and in no\r\nmanner wise that ye draw not to her. Also this twelvemonth and a day\r\nthat ye bear none armour nor none harness of war. Now promise me this,\r\nor here shalt thou die. Alas, said Palamides, for ever am I ashamed.\r\nThen he sware as Sir Tristram had commanded him. Then for despite and\r\nanger Sir Palamides cut off his harness, and threw them away.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Tristram turned again to the castle where was La Beale\r\nIsoud; and by the way he met with a damosel that asked after Sir\r\nLauncelot, that won the Dolorous Guard worshipfully; and this damosel\r\nasked Sir Tristram what he was. For it was told her that it was he that\r\nsmote down Sir Palamides, by whom the ten knights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s were\r\nsmitten down. Then the damosel prayed Sir Tristram to tell her what he\r\nwas, and whether that he were Sir Launcelot du Lake, for she deemed\r\nthat there was no knight in the world might do such deeds of arms but\r\nif it were Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that\r\nI am not Sir Launcelot, for I was never of such prowess, but in God is\r\nall that he may make me as good a knight as the good knight Sir\r\nLauncelot. Now, gentle knight, said she, put up thy visor; and when she\r\nbeheld his visage she thought she saw never a better man\xe2\x80\x99s visage, nor\r\na better faring knight. And then when the damosel knew certainly that\r\nhe was not Sir Launcelot, then she took her leave, and departed from\r\nhim. And then Sir Tristram rode privily unto the postern, where kept\r\nhim La Beale Isoud, and there she made him good cheer, and thanked God\r\nof his good speed. So anon, within a while the king and the queen\r\nunderstood that it was Tramtrist that smote down Sir Palamides; then\r\nwas he much made of, more than he was before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How the queen espied that Sir Tristram had slain her\r\nbrother Sir Marhaus by his sword, and in what jeopardy he was.\r\n\r\nThus was Sir Tramtrist long there well cherished with the king and the\r\nqueen, and namely with La Beale Isoud. So upon a day the queen and La\r\nBeale Isoud made a bain for Sir Tramtrist. And when he was in his bain\r\nthe queen and Isoud, her daughter, roamed up and down in the chamber;\r\nand therewhiles Gouvernail and Hebes attended upon Tramtrist, and the\r\nqueen beheld his sword thereas it lay upon his bed. And then by unhap\r\nthe queen drew out his sword and beheld it a long while, and both they\r\nthought it a passing fair sword; but within a foot and an half of the\r\npoint there was a great piece thereof out-broken of the edge. And when\r\nthe queen espied that gap in the sword, she remembered her of a piece\r\nof a sword that was found in the brain-pan of Sir Marhaus, the good\r\nknight that was her brother. Alas then, said she unto her daughter, La\r\nBeale Isoud, this is the same traitor knight that slew my brother,\r\nthine eme. When Isoud heard her say so she was passing sore abashed,\r\nfor passing well she loved Tramtrist, and full well she knew the\r\ncruelness of her mother the queen.\r\n\r\nAnon therewithal the queen went unto her own chamber, and sought her\r\ncoffer, and there she took out the piece or the sword that was pulled\r\nout of Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 head after that he was dead. And then she ran with\r\nthat piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the bed. And when she put\r\nthat piece of steel and iron unto the sword, it was as meet as it might\r\nbe when it was new broken. And then the queen gripped that sword in her\r\nhand fiercely, and with all her might she ran straight upon Tramtrist\r\nwhere he sat in his bain, and there she had rived him through had not\r\nSir Hebes gotten her in his arms, and pulled the sword from her, and\r\nelse she had thrust him through.\r\n\r\nThen when she was let of her evil will she ran to the King Anguish, her\r\nhusband, and said on her knees: O my lord, here have ye in your house\r\nthat traitor knight that slew my brother and your servant, that noble\r\nknight, Sir Marhaus. Who is that, said King Anguish, and where is he?\r\nSir, she said, it is Sir Tramtrist, the same knight that my daughter\r\nhealed. Alas, said the king, therefore am I right heavy, for he is a\r\nfull noble knight as ever I saw in field. But I charge you, said the\r\nking to the queen, that ye have not ado with that knight, but let me\r\ndeal with him.\r\n\r\nThen the king went into the chamber unto Sir Tramtrist, and then was he\r\ngone unto his chamber, and the king found him all ready armed to mount\r\nupon his horse. When the king saw him all ready armed to go unto\r\nhorseback, the king said: Nay, Tramtrist, it will not avail to compare\r\nthee against me; but thus much I shall do for my worship and for thy\r\nlove; in so much as thou art within my court it were no worship for me\r\nto slay thee: therefore upon this condition I will give thee leave for\r\nto depart from this court in safety, so thou wilt tell me who was thy\r\nfather, and what is thy name, and if thou slew Sir Marhaus, my brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Tristram departed from the king and La Beale Isoud\r\nout of Ireland for to come into Cornwall.\r\n\r\nSir, said Tristram, now I shall tell you all the truth: my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname is Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my mother hight Elizabeth,\r\nthat was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and my mother died of me in\r\nthe forest, and because thereof she commanded, or she died, that when I\r\nwere christened they should christen me Tristram; and because I would\r\nnot be known in this country I turned my name and let me call\r\nTramtrist; and for the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nand for the right of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years. And wit\r\nye well, said Tristram unto the king, I did the battle for the love of\r\nmine uncle, King Mark, and for the love of the country of Cornwall, and\r\nfor to increase mine honour; for that same day that I fought with Sir\r\nMarhaus I was made knight, and never or then did I battle with no\r\nknight, and from me he went alive, and left his shield and his sword\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nSo God me help, said the king, I may not say but ye did as a knight\r\nshould, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and to increase\r\nyour worship as a knight should; howbeit I may not maintain you in this\r\ncountry with my worship, unless that I should displease my barons, and\r\nmy wife and her kin. Sir, said Tristram, I thank you of your good\r\nlordship that I have had with you here, and the great goodness my lady,\r\nyour daughter, hath shewed me, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, it may\r\nso happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death, for in\r\nthe parts of England it may happen I may do you service at some season,\r\nthat ye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good lordship. With\r\nmore I promise you as I am true knight, that in all places I shall be\r\nmy lady your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s servant and knight in right and in wrong, and I\r\nshall never fail her, to do as much as a knight may do. Also I beseech\r\nyour good grace that I may take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and\r\nat all the barons and knights. I will well, said the king.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of her.\r\nAnd then he told her all, what he was, and how he had changed his name\r\nbecause he would not be known, and how a lady told him that he should\r\nnever be whole till he came into this country where the poison was\r\nmade, wherethrough I was near my death had not your ladyship been. O\r\ngentle knight, said La Beale Isoud, full woe am I of thy departing, for\r\nI saw never man that I owed so good will to. And therewithal she wept\r\nheartily. Madam, said Sir Tristram, ye shall understand that my name is\r\nSir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his queen.\r\nAnd I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days of my life\r\nyour knight. Gramercy, said La Beale Isoud, and I promise you\r\nthere-against that I shall not be married this seven years but by your\r\nassent; and to whom that ye will I shall be married to him will I have,\r\nand he will have me if ye will consent.\r\n\r\nAnd then Sir Tristram gave her a ring, and she gave him another; and\r\ntherewith he departed from her, leaving her making great dole and\r\nlamentation; and he straight went unto the court among all the barons,\r\nand there he took his leave at most and least, and openly he said among\r\nthem all: Fair lords, now it is so that I must depart: if there be any\r\nman here that I have offended unto, or that any man be with me grieved,\r\nlet complain him here afore me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend\r\nit unto my power. And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or\r\nsay of me wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here\r\nis my body to make it good, body against body. And all they stood\r\nstill, there was not one that would say one word; yet were there some\r\nknights that were of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and of Sir Marhaus\xe2\x80\x99 blood, but\r\nthey would not meddle with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Tristram and King Mark hurted each other for the\r\nlove of a knight\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nSo Sir Tristram departed, and took the sea, and with good wind he\r\narrived up at Tintagil in Cornwall; and when King Mark was whole in his\r\nprosperity there came tidings that Sir Tristram was arrived, and whole\r\nof his wounds: thereof was King Mark passing glad, and so were all the\r\nbarons; and when he saw his time he rode unto his father, King\r\nMeliodas, and there he had all the cheer that the king and the queen\r\ncould make him. And then largely King Meliodas and his queen departed\r\nof their lands and goods to Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nThen by the license of King Meliodas, his father, he returned again\r\nunto the court of King Mark, and there he lived in great joy long time,\r\nuntil at the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt\r\nKing Mark and Sir Tristram, for they loved both one lady. And she was\r\nan earl\xe2\x80\x99s wife that hight Sir Segwarides. And this lady loved Sir\r\nTristram passingly well. And he loved her again, for she was a passing\r\nfair lady, and that espied Sir Tristram well. Then King Mark understood\r\nthat and was jealous, for King Mark loved her passingly well.\r\n\r\nSo it fell upon a day this lady sent a dwarf unto Sir Tristram, and\r\nbade him, as he loved her, that he would be with her the night next\r\nfollowing. Also she charged you that ye come not to her but if ye be\r\nwell armed, for her lover was called a good knight. Sir Tristram\r\nanswered to the dwarf: Recommend me unto my lady, and tell her I will\r\nnot fail but I will be with her the term that she hath set me. And with\r\nthis answer the dwarf departed. And King Mark espied that the dwarf was\r\nwith Sir Tristram upon message from Segwarides\xe2\x80\x99 wife; then King Mark\r\nsent for the dwarf, and when he was come he made the dwarf by force to\r\ntell him all, why and wherefore that he came on message from Sir\r\nTristram. Now, said King Mark, go where thou wilt, and upon pain of\r\ndeath that thou say no word that thou spakest with me; so the dwarf\r\ndeparted from the king.\r\n\r\nAnd that same night that the steven was set betwixt Segwarides\xe2\x80\x99 wife\r\nand Sir Tristram, King Mark armed him, and made him ready, and took two\r\nknights of his counsel with him; and so he rode afore for to abide by\r\nthe way for to wait upon Sir Tristram. And as Sir Tristram came riding\r\nupon his way with his spear in his hand, King Mark came hurtling upon\r\nhim with his two knights suddenly. And all three smote him with their\r\nspears, and King Mark hurt Sir Tristram on the breast right sore. And\r\nthen Sir Tristram feutred his spear, and smote his uncle, King Mark, so\r\nsore, that he rashed him to the earth, and bruised him that he lay\r\nstill in a swoon, and long it was or ever he might wield himself. And\r\nthen he ran to the one knight, and eft to the other, and smote them to\r\nthe cold earth, that they lay still. And therewithal Sir Tristram rode\r\nforth sore wounded to the lady, and found her abiding him at a postern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram lay with the lady, and how her husband\r\nfought with Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nAnd there she welcomed him fair, and either halsed other in arms, and\r\nso she let put up his horse in the best wise, and then she unarmed him.\r\nAnd so they supped lightly, and went to bed with great joy and\r\npleasaunce; and so in his raging he took no keep of his green wound\r\nthat King Mark had given him. And so Sir Tristram be-bled both the over\r\nsheet and the nether, and pillows, and head sheet. And within a while\r\nthere came one afore, that warned her that her lord was near-hand\r\nwithin a bow-draught. So she made Sir Tristram to arise, and so he\r\narmed him, and took his horse, and so departed. By then was come\r\nSegwarides, her lord, and when he found her bed troubled and broken,\r\nand went near and beheld it by candle light, then he saw that there had\r\nlain a wounded knight. Ah, false traitress, then he said, why hast thou\r\nbetrayed me? And therewithal he swang out a sword, and said: But if\r\nthou tell me who hath been here, here thou shalt die. Ah, my lord,\r\nmercy, said the lady, and held up her hands, saying: Slay me not, and I\r\nshall tell you all who hath been here. Tell anon, said Segwarides, to\r\nme all the truth. Anon for dread she said: Here was Sir Tristram with\r\nme, and by the way as he came to me ward, he was sore wounded. Ah,\r\nfalse traitress, said Segwarides, where is he become? Sir, she said, he\r\nis armed, and departed on horseback, not yet hence half a mile. Ye say\r\nwell, said Segwarides.\r\n\r\nThen he armed him lightly, and gat his horse, and rode after Sir\r\nTristram that rode straightway unto Tintagil. And within a while he\r\novertook Sir Tristram, and then he bade him, Turn, false traitor\r\nknight. And Sir Tristram anon turned him against him. And therewithal\r\nSegwarides smote Sir Tristram with a spear that it all to-brast; and\r\nthen he swang out his sword and smote fast at Sir Tristram. Sir knight,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, I counsel you that ye smite no more, howbeit for the\r\nwrongs that I have done you I will forbear you as long as I may. Nay,\r\nsaid Segwarides, that shall not be, for either thou shalt die or I.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram drew out his sword, and hurtled his horse unto him\r\nfiercely, and through the waist of the body he smote Sir Segwarides\r\nthat he fell to the earth in a swoon. And so Sir Tristram departed and\r\nleft him there. And so he rode unto Tintagil and took his lodging\r\nsecretly, for he would not be known that he was hurt. Also Sir\r\nSegwarides\xe2\x80\x99 men rode after their master, whom they found lying in the\r\nfield sore wounded, and brought him home on his shield, and there he\r\nlay long or that he were whole, but at the last he recovered. Also King\r\nMark would not be aknown of that Sir Tristram and he had met that\r\nnight. And as for Sir Tristram, he knew not that King Mark had met with\r\nhim. And so the king askance came to Sir Tristram, to comfort him as he\r\nlay sick in his bed. But as long as King Mark lived he loved never Sir\r\nTristram after that; though there was fair speech, love was there none.\r\nAnd thus it passed many weeks and days, and all was forgiven and\r\nforgotten; for Sir Segwarides durst not have ado with Sir Tristram,\r\nbecause of his noble prowess, and also because he was nephew unto King\r\nMark; therefore he let it overslip: for he that hath a privy hurt is\r\nloath to have a shame outward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Bleoberis demanded the fairest lady in King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt, whom he took away, and how he was fought with.\r\n\r\nThen it befell upon a day that the good knight Bleoberis de Ganis,\r\nbrother to Blamore de Ganis, and nigh cousin unto the good knight Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake, this Bleoberis came unto the court of King Mark, and\r\nthere he asked of King Mark a boon, to give him what gift that he would\r\nask in his court. When the king heard him ask so, he marvelled of his\r\nasking, but because he was a knight of the Round Table, and of a great\r\nrenown, King Mark granted him his whole asking. Then, said Sir\r\nBleoberis, I will have the fairest lady in your court that me list to\r\nchoose. I may not say nay, said King Mark; now choose at your\r\nadventure. And so Sir Bleoberis did choose Sir Segwarides\xe2\x80\x99 wife, and\r\ntook her by the hand, and so went his way with her; and so he took his\r\nhorse and gart set her behind his squire, and rode upon his way.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Segwarides heard tell that his lady was gone with a knight of\r\nKing Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, then he armed him and rode after that knight for\r\nto rescue his lady. So when Bleoberis was gone with this lady, King\r\nMark and all the court was wroth that she was away. Then were there\r\ncertain ladies that knew that there were great love between Sir\r\nTristram and her, and also that lady loved Sir Tristram above all other\r\nknights. Then there was one lady that rebuked Sir Tristram in the\r\nhorriblest wise, and called him coward knight, that he would for shame\r\nof his knighthood see a lady so shamefully be taken away from his\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s court. But she meant that either of them had loved other with\r\nentire heart. But Sir Tristram answered her thus: Fair lady, it is not\r\nmy part to have ado in such matters while her lord and husband is\r\npresent here; and if it had been that her lord had not been here in\r\nthis court, then for the worship of this court peradventure I would\r\nhave been her champion, and if so be Sir Segwarides speed not well, it\r\nmay happen that I will speak with that good knight or ever he pass from\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThen within a while came one of Sir Segwarides\xe2\x80\x99 squires, and told in\r\nthe court that Sir Segwarides was beaten sore and wounded to the point\r\nof death; as he would have rescued his lady Sir Bleoberis overthrew him\r\nand sore hath wounded him. Then was King Mark heavy thereof, and all\r\nthe court. When Sir Tristram heard of this he was ashamed and sore\r\ngrieved; and then was he soon armed and on horseback, and Gouvernail,\r\nhis servant, bare his shield and spear. And so as Sir Tristram rode\r\nfast he met with Sir Andred his cousin, that by the commandment of King\r\nMark was sent to bring forth, an ever it lay in his power, two knights\r\nof Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, that rode by the country to seek their adventures.\r\nWhen Sir Tristram saw Sir Andred he asked him what tidings. So God me\r\nhelp, said Sir Andred, there was never worse with me, for here by the\r\ncommandment of King Mark I was sent to fetch two knights of King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, and that one beat me and wounded me, and set nought by\r\nmy message. Fair cousin, said Sir Tristram, ride on your way, and if I\r\nmay meet them it may happen I shall revenge you. So Sir Andred rode\r\ninto Cornwall, and Sir Tristram rode after the two knights, the which\r\none hight Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Tristram fought with two knights of the Round\r\nTable.\r\n\r\nThen within a while Sir Tristram saw them afore him, two likely\r\nknights. Sir, said Gouvernail unto his master, Sir, I would counsel you\r\nnot to have ado with them, for they be two proved knights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt. As for that, said Sir Tristram, have ye no doubt but I will have\r\nado with them to increase my worship, for it is many day sithen I did\r\nany deeds of arms. Do as ye list, said Gouvernail. And therewithal anon\r\nSir Tristram asked them from whence they came, and whither they would,\r\nand what they did in those marches. Sir Sagramore looked upon Sir\r\nTristram, and had scorn of his words, and asked him again, Fair knight,\r\nbe ye a knight of Cornwall? Whereby ask ye it? said Sir Tristram. For\r\nit is seldom seen, said Sir Sagramore, that ye Cornish knights be\r\nvaliant men of arms; for within these two hours there met us one of\r\nyour Cornish knights, and great words he spake, and anon with little\r\nmight he was laid to the earth. And, as I trow, said Sir Sagramore, ye\r\nshall have the same handsel that he had. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram,\r\nit may so happen that I may better withstand than he did, and whether\r\nye will or nill I will have ado with you, because he was my cousin that\r\nye beat. And therefore here do your best, and wit ye well but if ye\r\nquit you the better here upon this ground, one knight of Cornwall shall\r\nbeat you both.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Dodinas le Savage heard him say so he gat a spear in his hand,\r\nand said, Sir knight, keep well thyself: And then they departed and\r\ncame together as it had been thunder. And Sir Dodinas\xe2\x80\x99 spear brast\r\nin-sunder, but Sir Tristram smote him with a more might, that he smote\r\nhim clean over the horse-croup, that nigh he had broken his neck. When\r\nSir Sagramore saw his fellow have such a fall he marvelled what knight\r\nhe might be. And he dressed his spear with all his might, and Sir\r\nTristram against him, and they came together as the thunder, and there\r\nSir Tristram smote Sir Sagramore a strong buffet, that he bare his\r\nhorse and him to the earth, and in the falling he brake his thigh.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done Sir Tristram asked them: Fair knights, will ye any\r\nmore? Be there no bigger knights in the court of King Arthur? it is to\r\nyou shame to say of us knights of Cornwall dishonour, for it may happen\r\na Cornish knight may match you. That is truth, said Sir Sagramore, that\r\nhave we well proved; but I require thee, said Sir Sagramore, tell us\r\nyour right name, by the faith and troth that ye owe to the high order\r\nof knighthood. Ye charge me with a great thing, said Sir Tristram, and\r\nsithen ye list to wit it, ye shall know and understand that my name is\r\nSir Tristram de Liones, King Meliodas\xe2\x80\x99 son, and nephew unto King Mark.\r\nThen were they two knights fain that they had met with Tristram, and so\r\nthey prayed him to abide in their fellowship. Nay, said Sir Tristram,\r\nfor I must have ado with one of your fellows, his name is Sir Bleoberis\r\nde Ganis. God speed you well, said Sir Sagramore and Dodinas. Sir\r\nTristram departed and rode onward on his way. And then was he ware\r\nbefore him in a valley where rode Sir Bleoberis, with Sir Segwarides\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlady, that rode behind his squire upon a palfrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Bleoberis for a lady,\r\nand how the lady was put to choice to whom she would go.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram rode more than a pace until that he had overtaken\r\nhim. Then spake Sir Tristram: Abide, he said, Knight of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court,\r\nbring again that lady, or deliver her to me. I will do neither, said\r\nBleoberis, for I dread no Cornish knight so sore that me list to\r\ndeliver her. Why, said Sir Tristram, may not a Cornish knight do as\r\nwell as another knight? this same day two knights of your court within\r\nthis three mile met with me, and or ever we departed they found a\r\nCornish knight good enough for them both. What were their names? said\r\nBleoberis. They told me, said Sir Tristram, that the one of them hight\r\nSir Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage. Ah,\r\nsaid Sir Bleoberis, have ye met with them? so God me help, they were\r\ntwo good knights and men of great worship, and if ye have beat them\r\nboth ye must needs be a good knight; but if it so be ye have beat them\r\nboth, yet shall ye not fear me, but ye shall beat me or ever ye have\r\nthis lady. Then defend you, said Sir Tristram. So they departed and\r\ncame together like thunder, and either bare other down, horse and all,\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\nThen they avoided their horses, and lashed together eagerly with\r\nswords, and mightily, now tracing and traversing on the right hand and\r\non the left hand more than two hours. And sometime they rushed together\r\nwith such a might that they lay both grovelling on the ground. Then Sir\r\nBleoberis de Ganis stert aback, and said thus: Now, gentle good knight,\r\na while hold your hands, and let us speak together. Say what ye will,\r\nsaid Tristram, and I will answer you. Sir, said Bleoberis, I would wit\r\nof whence ye be, and of whom ye be come, and what is your name? So God\r\nme help, said Sir Tristram, I fear not to tell you my name. Wit ye well\r\nI am King Meliodas\xe2\x80\x99 son, and my mother is King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and my\r\nname is Sir Tristram de Liones, and King Mark is mine uncle. Truly,\r\nsaid Bleoberis, I am right glad of you, for ye are he that slew Marhaus\r\nthe knight, hand for hand in an island, for the truage of Cornwall;\r\nalso ye overcame Sir Palamides the good knight, at a tournament in an\r\nisland, where ye beat Sir Gawaine and his nine fellows. So God me help,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am the same knight; now I have\r\ntold you my name, tell me yours with good will. Wit ye well that my\r\nname is Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and my brother hight Sir Blamore de\r\nGanis, that is called a good knight, and we be sister\xe2\x80\x99s children unto\r\nmy lord Sir Launcelot du Lake, that we call one of the best knights of\r\nthe world. That is truth, said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot is called\r\npeerless of courtesy and of knighthood; and for his sake, said Sir\r\nTristram, I will not with my good will fight no more with you, for the\r\ngreat love I have to Sir Launcelot du Lake. In good faith, said\r\nBleoberis, as for me I will be loath to fight with you; but sithen ye\r\nfollow me here to have this lady, I shall proffer you kindness,\r\ncourtesy, and gentleness right here upon this ground. This lady shall\r\nbe betwixt us both, and to whom that she will go, let him have her in\r\npeace. I will well, said Tristram, for, as I deem, she will leave you\r\nand come to me. Ye shall prove it anon, said Bleoberis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir\r\nBleoberis, and how she desired to go to her husband.\r\n\r\nSo when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto Sir\r\nTristram: Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late thou wast\r\nthe man in the world that I most loved and trusted, and I weened thou\r\nhadst loved me again above all ladies; but when thou sawest this knight\r\nlead me away thou madest no cheer to rescue me, but suffered my lord\r\nSegwarides ride after me; but until that time I weened thou haddest\r\nloved me, and therefore now I will leave thee, and never love thee\r\nmore. And therewithal she went unto Sir Bleoberis.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Tristram saw her do so he was wonderly wroth with that lady,\r\nand ashamed to come to the court. Sir Tristram, said Sir Bleoberis, ye\r\nare in the default, for I hear by this lady\xe2\x80\x99s words she before this day\r\ntrusted you above all earthly knights, and, as she saith, ye have\r\ndeceived her, therefore wit ye well, there may no man hold that will\r\naway; and rather than ye should be heartily displeased with me I would\r\nye had her, an she would abide with you. Nay, said the lady, so God me\r\nhelp I will never go with him; for he that I loved most I weened he had\r\nloved me. And therefore, Sir Tristram, she said, ride as thou came, for\r\nthough thou haddest overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with thee\r\nnever would I have gone. And I shall pray this knight so fair of his\r\nknighthood, that or ever he pass this country, that he will lead me to\r\nthe abbey where my lord Sir Segwarides lieth. So God me help, said\r\nBleoberis, I let you wit, good knight Sir Tristram, because King Mark\r\ngave me the choice of a gift in this court, and so this lady liked me\r\nbest\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding, she is wedded and hath a lord, and I have\r\nfulfilled my quest, she shall be sent unto her husband again, and in\r\nespecial most for your sake, Sir Tristram; and if she would go with you\r\nI would ye had her. I thank you, said Sir Tristram, but for her love I\r\nshall beware what manner a lady I shall love or trust; for had her\r\nlord, Sir Segwarides, been away from the court, I should have been the\r\nfirst that should have followed you; but sithen that ye have refused\r\nme, as I am true knight I shall her know passingly well that I shall\r\nlove or trust. And so they took their leave one from the other and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagil, and Sir Bleoberis rode unto the\r\nabbey where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there he delivered his\r\nlady, and departed as a noble knight; and when Sir Segwarides saw his\r\nlady, he was greatly comforted; and then she told him that Sir Tristram\r\nhad done great battle with Sir Bleoberis, and caused him to bring her\r\nagain. These words pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram\r\nwould do so much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark\r\nbetwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud toward\r\nIreland, and how by fortune he arrived into England.\r\n\r\nThen when this was done King Mark cast always in his heart how he might\r\ndestroy Sir Tristram. And then he imagined in himself to send Sir\r\nTristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud. For Sir Tristram had so\r\npraised her beauty and her goodness that King Mark said that he would\r\nwed her, whereupon he prayed Sir Tristram to take his way into Ireland\r\nfor him on message. And all this was done to the intent to slay Sir\r\nTristram. Notwithstanding, Sir Tristram would not refuse the message\r\nfor no danger nor peril that might fall, for the pleasure of his uncle,\r\nbut to go he made him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be\r\ndevised. For Sir Tristram took with him the most goodliest knights that\r\nhe might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise that\r\nwas then used, in the goodliest manner. So Sir Tristram departed and\r\ntook the sea with all his fellowship. And anon, as he was in the broad\r\nsea a tempest took him and his fellowship, and drove them back into the\r\ncoast of England; and there they arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain\r\nthey were to take the land.\r\n\r\nAnd when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his pavilion upon the\r\nland of Camelot, and there he let hang his shield upon the pavilion.\r\nAnd that same day came two knights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, that one was Sir\r\nEctor de Maris, and Sir Morganor. And they touched the shield, and bade\r\nhim come out of the pavilion for to joust, an he would joust. Ye shall\r\nbe answered, said Sir Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while. So he\r\nmade him ready, and first he smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after\r\nhe smote down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them.\r\nAnd when they lay upon the earth they asked Sir Tristram what he was,\r\nand of what country he was knight. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, wit\r\nye well that I am of Cornwall. Alas, said Sir Ector, now am I ashamed\r\nthat ever any Cornish knight should overcome me. And then for despite\r\nSir Ector put off his armour from him, and went on foot, and would not\r\nride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. How King Anguish of Ireland was summoned to come to King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s court for treason.\r\n\r\nThen it fell that Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamore de Ganis, that were\r\nbrethren, they had summoned the King Anguish of Ireland for to come to\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s court upon pain of forfeiture of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s good grace. And\r\nif the King of Ireland came not in, at the day assigned and set, the\r\nking should lose his lands. So it happened that at the day assigned,\r\nKing Arthur neither Sir Launcelot might not be there for to give the\r\njudgment, for King Arthur was with Sir Launcelot at the Castle Joyous\r\nGarde. And so King Arthur assigned King Carados and the King of Scots\r\nto be there that day as judges. So when the kings were at Camelot King\r\nAnguish of Ireland was come to know his accusers. Then was there Sir\r\nBlamore de Ganis, and appealed the King of Ireland of treason, that he\r\nhad slain a cousin of his in his court in Ireland by treason. The king\r\nwas sore abashed of his accusation, for-why he was come at the summons\r\nof King Arthur, and or he came at Camelot he wist not wherefore he was\r\nsent after. And when the king heard Sir Blamore say his will, he\r\nunderstood well there was none other remedy but for to answer him\r\nknightly; for the custom was such in those days, that an any man were\r\nappealed of any treason or murder he should fight body for body, or\r\nelse to find another knight for him. And all manner of murders in those\r\ndays were called treason.\r\n\r\nSo when King Anguish understood his accusing he was passing heavy, for\r\nhe knew Sir Blamore de Ganis that he was a noble knight, and of noble\r\nknights come. Then the King of Ireland was simply purveyed of his\r\nanswer; therefore the judges gave him respite by the third day to give\r\nhis answer. So the king departed unto his lodging. The meanwhile there\r\ncame a lady by Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion making great dole. What aileth\r\nyou, said Sir Tristram, that ye make such dole? Ah, fair knight, said\r\nthe lady, I am ashamed unless that some good knight help me; for a\r\ngreat lady of worship sent by me a fair child and a rich, unto Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake, and hereby there met with me a knight, and threw me\r\ndown from my palfrey, and took away the child from me. Well, my lady,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, and for my lord Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s sake I shall get you\r\nthat child again, or else I shall be beaten for it. And so Sir Tristram\r\ntook his horse, and asked the lady which way the knight rode; and then\r\nshe told him. And he rode after him, and within a while he overtook\r\nthat knight. And then Sir Tristram bade him turn and give again the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. How Sir Tristram rescued a child from a knight, and how\r\nGouvernail told him of King Anguish.\r\n\r\nThe knight turned his horse and made him ready to fight. And then Sir\r\nTristram smote him with a sword such a buffet that he tumbled to the\r\nearth. And then he yielded him unto Sir Tristram. Then come thy way,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, and bring the child to the lady again. So he took\r\nhis horse meekly and rode with Sir Tristram; and then by the way Sir\r\nTristram asked him his name. Then he said, My name is Breuse Saunce\r\nPit\xc3\xa9. So when he had delivered that child to the lady, he said: Sir, as\r\nin this the child is well remedied. Then Sir Tristram let him go again\r\nthat sore repented him after, for he was a great foe unto many good\r\nknights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\n\r\nThen when Sir Tristram was in his pavilion Gouvernail, his man, came\r\nand told him how that King Anguish of Ireland was come thither, and he\r\nwas put in great distress; and there Gouvernail told Sir Tristram how\r\nKing Anguish was summoned and appealed of murder. So God me help, said\r\nSir Tristram, these be the best tidings that ever came to me this seven\r\nyears, for now shall the King of Ireland have need of my help; for I\r\ndaresay there is no knight in this country that is not of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt dare do battle with Sir Blamore de Ganis; and for to win the love\r\nof the King of Ireland I will take the battle upon me; and therefore\r\nGouvernail bring me, I charge thee, to the king.\r\n\r\nThen Gouvernail went unto King Anguish of Ireland, and saluted him\r\nfair. The king welcomed him and asked him what he would. Sir, said\r\nGouvernail, here is a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you:\r\nhe bade me say he would do you service. What knight is he? said the\r\nking. Sir, said he, it is Sir Tristram de Liones, that for your good\r\ngrace that ye showed him in your lands will reward you in this country.\r\nCome on, fellow, said the king, with me anon and show me unto Sir\r\nTristram. So the king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with\r\nhim, until he came unto Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion. And when Sir Tristram\r\nsaw the king he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup. But the\r\nking leapt from his horse lightly, and either halsed other in their\r\narms. My gracious lord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your great\r\ngoodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at that time I\r\npromised you to do you service an ever it lay in my power. And, gentle\r\nknight, said the king unto Sir Tristram, now have I great need of you,\r\nnever had I so great need of no knight\xe2\x80\x99s help. How so, my good lord?\r\nsaid Sir Tristram. I shall tell you, said the king: I am summoned and\r\nappealed from my country for the death of a knight that was kin unto\r\nthe good knight Sir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother\r\nto Sir Bleoberis hath appealed me to fight with him, outher to find a\r\nknight in my stead. And well I wot, said the king, these that are come\r\nof King Ban\xe2\x80\x99s blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good\r\nknights, and hard men for to win in battle as any that I know now\r\nliving. Sir, said Sir Tristram, for the good lordship ye showed me in\r\nIreland, and for my lady your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sake, La Beale Isoud, I will\r\ntake the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two\r\nthings: that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right,\r\nthat ye were never consenting to the knight\xe2\x80\x99s death; Sir, then said Sir\r\nTristram, when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace that\r\nI speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that I\r\nwill ask of you. So God me help, said the king, ye shall have\r\nwhatsomever ye will ask. It is well said, said Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his\r\nadversary, and how his adversary would never yield him.\r\n\r\nNow make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in\r\nyour quarrel rather than to be recreant. I have no doubt of you, said\r\nthe king, that, an ye should have ado with Sir Launcelot du Lake\xe2\x80\x94 Sir,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, as for Sir Launcelot, he is called the noblest\r\nknight of the world, and wit ye well that the knights of his blood are\r\nnoble men, and dread shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother unto Sir\r\nBlamore, I have done battle with him, therefore upon my head it is no\r\nshame to call him a good knight. It is noised, said the king, that\r\nBlamore is the hardier knight. Sir, as for that let him be, he shall\r\nnever be refused, an as he were the best knight that now beareth shield\r\nor spear.\r\n\r\nSo King Anguish departed unto King Carados and the kings that were that\r\ntime as judges, and told them that he had found his champion ready.\r\nThen by the commandment of the kings Sir Blamore de Ganis and Sir\r\nTristram were sent for to hear the charge. And when they were come\r\nbefore the judges there were many kings and knights beheld Sir\r\nTristram, and much speech they had of him because that he slew Sir\r\nMarhaus, the good knight, and because he for-jousted Sir Palamides the\r\ngood knight. So when they had taken their charge they withdrew them to\r\nmake them ready to do battle.\r\n\r\nThen said Sir Bleoberis unto his brother, Sir Blamore: Fair dear\r\nbrother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother\xe2\x80\x99s children,\r\nand there was never none of our kin that ever was shamed in battle; and\r\nrather suffer death, brother, than to be shamed. Brother, said Blamore,\r\nhave ye no doubt of me, for I shall never shame none of my blood;\r\nhowbeit I am sure that yonder knight is called a passing good knight as\r\nof his time one of the world, yet shall I never yield me, nor say the\r\nloath word: well may he happen to smite me down with his great might of\r\nchivalry, but rather shall he slay me than I shall yield me as\r\nrecreant. God speed you well, said Sir Bleoberis, for ye shall find him\r\nthe mightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him, for I\r\nhave had ado with him. God me speed, said Sir Blamore de Ganis; and\r\ntherewith he took his horse at the one end of the lists, and Sir\r\nTristram at the other end of the lists, and so they feutred their\r\nspears and came together as it had been thunder; and there Sir Tristram\r\nthrough great might smote down Sir Blamore and his horse to the earth.\r\nThen anon Sir Blamore avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and\r\nthrew his shield afore him, and bade Sir Tristram alight: For though an\r\nhorse hath failed me, I trust to God the earth will not fail me. And\r\nthen Sir Tristram alighted, and dressed him unto battle; and there they\r\nlashed together strongly as racing and tracing, foining and dashing,\r\nmany sad strokes, that the kings and knights had great wonder that they\r\nmight stand; for ever they fought like wood men, so that there was\r\nnever knights seen fight more fiercely than they did; for Sir Blamore\r\nwas so hasty that he would have no rest, that all men wondered that\r\nthey had breath to stand on their feet; and all the place was bloody\r\nthat they fought in. And at the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamore\r\nsuch a buffet upon the helm that he there fell down upon his side, and\r\nSir Tristram stood and beheld him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Blamore desired Tristram to slay him, and how\r\nSir Tristram spared him, and how they took appointment.\r\n\r\nThen when Sir Blamore might speak, he said thus: Sir Tristram de\r\nLiones, I require thee, as thou art a noble knight, and the best knight\r\nthat ever I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I would not live to\r\nbe made lord of all the earth, for I have liefer die with worship than\r\nlive with shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou must slay me, or else\r\nthou shalt never win the field, for I will never say the loath word.\r\nAnd therefore if thou dare slay me, slay me, I require thee. When Sir\r\nTristram heard him say so knightly, he wist not what to do with him; he\r\nremembering him of both parties, of what blood he was come, and for Sir\r\nLauncelot\xe2\x80\x99s sake he would be loath to slay him; and in the other party\r\nin no wise he might not choose, but that he must make him to say the\r\nloath word, or else to slay him.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram stert aback, and went to the kings that were judges,\r\nand there he kneeled down to-fore them, and besought them for their\r\nworships, and for King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s and Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that they\r\nwould take this matter in their hands. For, my fair lords, said Sir\r\nTristram, it were shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder\r\nlieth should be slain; for ye hear well, shamed will he not be, and I\r\npray to God that he never be slain nor shamed for me. And as for the\r\nking for whom I fight for, I shall require him, as I am his true\r\nchampion and true knight in this field, that he will have mercy upon\r\nthis good knight. So God me help, said King Anguish, I will for your\r\nsake; Sir Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my\r\ntrue knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be here\r\nas judges to take it in their hands. And the kings that were judges\r\ncalled Sir Bleoberis to them, and asked him his advice. My lords, said\r\nBleoberis, though my brother be beaten, and hath the worse through\r\nmight of arms, I dare say, though Sir Tristram hath beaten his body he\r\nhath not beaten his heart, and I thank God he is not shamed this day;\r\nand rather than he should be shamed I require you, said Bleoberis, let\r\nSir Tristram slay him out. It shall not be so, said the kings, for his\r\npart adversary, both the king and the champion, have pity of Sir\r\nBlamore\xe2\x80\x99s knighthood. My lords, said Bleoberis, I will right well as ye\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThen the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him goodly and\r\ntreatable. And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and Sir\r\nBleoberis took up Sir Blamore, and the two brethren were accorded with\r\nKing Anguish, and kissed and made friends for ever. And then Sir\r\nBlamore and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their\r\noaths that they would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir\r\nTristram, and Sir Tristram made the same oath. And for that gentle\r\nbattle all the blood of Sir Launcelot loved Sir Tristram for ever.\r\n\r\nThen King Anguish and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed into\r\nIreland with great noblesse and joy. So when they were in Ireland the\r\nking let make it known throughout all the land how and in what manner\r\nSir Tristram had done for him. Then the queen and all that there were\r\nmade the most of him that they might. But the joy that La Beale Isoud\r\nmade of Sir Tristram there might no tongue tell, for of all men earthly\r\nshe loved him most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram demanded La Beale Isoud for King Mark,\r\nand how Sir Tristram and Isoud drank the love drink.\r\n\r\nThen upon a day King Anguish asked Sir Tristram why he asked not his\r\nboon, for whatsomever he had promised him he should have it without\r\nfail. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now is it time; this is all that I will\r\ndesire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud, your daughter, not for\r\nmyself, but for mine uncle, King Mark, that shall have her to wife, for\r\nso have I promised him. Alas, said the king, I had liefer than all the\r\nland that I have ye would wed her yourself. Sir, an I did then I were\r\nshamed for ever in this world, and false of my promise. Therefore, said\r\nSir I Tristram, I pray you hold your promise that ye promised me; for\r\nthis is my desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud to go with me\r\ninto Cornwall for to be wedded to King Mark, mine uncle. As for that,\r\nsaid King Anguish, ye shall have her with you to do with her what it\r\nplease you; that is for to say if that ye list to wed her yourself,\r\nthat is me liefest, and if ye will give her unto King Mark, your uncle,\r\nthat is in your choice. So, to make short conclusion, La Beale Isoud\r\nwas made ready to go with Sir Tristram, and Dame Bragwaine went with\r\nher for her chief gentlewoman, with many other.\r\n\r\nThen the queen, Isoud\xe2\x80\x99s mother, gave to her and Dame Bragwaine, her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s gentlewoman, and unto Gouvernail, a drink, and charged them\r\nthat what day King Mark should wed, that same day they should give him\r\nthat drink, so that King Mark should drink to La Beale Isoud, and then,\r\nsaid the queen, I undertake either shall love other the days of their\r\nlife. So this drink was given unto Dame Bragwaine, and unto Gouvernail.\r\nAnd then anon Sir Tristram took the sea, and La Beale Isoud; and when\r\nthey were in their cabin, it happed so that they were thirsty, and they\r\nsaw a little flasket of gold stand by them, and it seemed by the colour\r\nand the taste that it was noble wine. Then Sir Tristram took the\r\nflasket in his hand, and said, Madam Isoud, here is the best drink that\r\never ye drank, that Dame Bragwaine, your maiden, and Gouvernail, my\r\nservant, have kept for themselves. Then they laughed and made good\r\ncheer, and either drank to other freely, and they thought never drink\r\nthat ever they drank to other was so sweet nor so good. But by that\r\ntheir drink was in their bodies, they loved either other so well that\r\nnever their love departed for weal neither for woe. And thus it happed\r\nthe love first betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, the which love\r\nnever departed the days of their life.\r\n\r\nSo then they sailed till by fortune they came nigh a castle that hight\r\nPluere, and thereby arrived for to repose them, weening to them to have\r\nhad good harbourage. But anon as Sir Tristram was within the castle\r\nthey were taken prisoners; for the custom of the castle was such; who\r\nthat rode by that castle and brought any lady, he must needs fight with\r\nthe lord, that hight Breunor. And if it were so that Breunor won the\r\nfield, then should the knight stranger and his lady be put to death,\r\nwhat that ever they were; and if it were so that the strange knight won\r\nthe field of Sir Breunor, then should he die and his lady both. This\r\ncustom was used many winters, for it was called the Castle Pluere, that\r\nis to say the Weeping Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he\r\nfought for her beauty, and smote off another lady\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nThus as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed a\r\nknight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer them. I have\r\nmarvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady, what is the cause\r\nthe lord of this castle holdeth us in prison: it was never the custom\r\nof no place of worship that ever I came in, when a knight and a lady\r\nasked harbour, and they to receive them, and after to destroy them that\r\nbe his guests. Sir, said the knight, this is the old custom of this\r\ncastle, that when a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our\r\nlord, and he that is weaker must lose his head. And when that is done,\r\nif his lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord\xe2\x80\x99s wife, she must\r\nlose her head: and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall\r\nthe lady of this castle lose her head. So God me help, said Sir\r\nTristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful. But one advantage have\r\nI, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair enough, fairer saw I never\r\nin all my life-days, and I doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not\r\nlose her head; and rather than I should lose my head I will fight for\r\nit on a fair field. Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord\r\nthat I will be ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle,\r\nif it be so I may have my horse and mine armour. Sir, said that knight,\r\nI undertake that your desire shall be sped right well. And then he\r\nsaid: Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make you ready\r\nand your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you behoveth. And\r\ntherewith he departed, and on the morn betimes that same knight came to\r\nSir Tristram, and fetched him out and his lady, and brought him horse\r\nand armour that was his own, and bade him make him ready to the field,\r\nfor all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready to\r\nbehold that battle and judgment.\r\n\r\nThen came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in his\r\nhand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: For an thy\r\nlady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady\xe2\x80\x99s head; and\r\nif my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I must strike off her\r\nhead. And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt\r\nlose thy head. Sir, said Tristram, this is a foul custom and horrible;\r\nand rather than my lady should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose my\r\nhead. Nay, nay, said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed\r\ntogether, and the one shall have her judgment. Nay, I will not so, said\r\nSir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. But I\r\ndoubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine, and that\r\nwill I prove and make good with my hand. And whosomever he be that will\r\nsay the contrary I will prove it on his head. And therewith Sir\r\nTristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her thrice about with his\r\nnaked sword in his hand. And when Sir Breunor saw that, he did the same\r\nwise turn his lady. But when Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him\r\nthought he saw never a fairer lady, and then he dread his lady\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nshould be off. And so all the people that were there present gave\r\njudgment that La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made.\r\nHow now, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should\r\nlose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used this\r\nwicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and ladies been\r\ndestroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy you both. So God\r\nme help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the sooth, thy lady is fairer\r\nthan mine, and that me sore repenteth. And so I hear the people privily\r\nsay, for of all women I saw none so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt\r\nslay my lady, I doubt not but I shall slay thee and have thy lady. Thou\r\nshalt win her, said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady. And\r\nbecause of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if\r\nthat she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me thy\r\nlady, said Sir Tristram. And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him\r\nand took his lady from him, and with an awk stroke he smote off her\r\nhead clean. Well, knight, said Sir Breunor, now hast thou done me a\r\ndespite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the last\r\nsmote off his head.\r\n\r\nNow take thine horse: sithen I am ladyless I will win thy lady an I\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nThen they took their horses and came together as it had been the\r\nthunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his horse, and\r\nlightly he rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him he thrust his\r\nhorse throughout both the shoulders, that his horse hurled here and\r\nthere and fell dead to the ground. And ever Sir Breunor ran after to\r\nhave slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram was light and nimble, and\r\nvoided his horse lightly. And or ever Sir Tristram might dress his\r\nshield and his sword the other gave him three or four sad strokes. Then\r\nthey rushed together like two boars, tracing and traversing mightily\r\nand wisely as two noble knights. For this Sir Breunor was a proved\r\nknight, and had been or then the death of many good knights, that it\r\nwas pity that he had so long endured.\r\n\r\nThus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and either\r\nwere wounded sore. Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed upon Sir\r\nTristram and took him in his arms, for he trusted much in his strength.\r\nThen was Sir Tristram called the strongest and the highest knight of\r\nthe world; for he was called bigger than Sir Launcelot, but Sir\r\nLauncelot was better breathed. So anon Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor\r\ndown grovelling, and then he unlaced his helm and struck off his head.\r\nAnd then all they that longed to the castle came to him, and did him\r\nhomage and fealty, praying him that he would abide there still a little\r\nwhile to fordo that foul custom. Sir Tristram granted thereto. The\r\nmeanwhile one of the knights of the castle rode unto Sir Galahad, the\r\nhaut prince, the which was Sir Breunor\xe2\x80\x99s son, which was a noble knight,\r\nand told him what misadventure his father had and his mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Galahad fought with Sir Tristram, and how Sir\r\nTristram yielded him and promised to fellowship with Launcelot.\r\n\r\nThen came Sir Galahad, and the King with the Hundred Knights with him;\r\nand this Sir Galahad proffered to fight with Sir Tristram hand for\r\nhand. And so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with\r\ngreat courage. Then Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram met together so hard\r\nthat either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth. And then they\r\navoided their horses as noble knights, and dressed their shields, and\r\ndrew their swords with ire and rancour, and they lashed together many\r\nsad strokes, and one while striking, another while foining, tracing and\r\ntraversing as noble knights; thus they fought long, near half a day,\r\nand either were sore wounded. At the last Sir Tristram waxed light and\r\nbig, and doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Galahad aback on the one\r\nside and on the other, so that he was like to have been slain.\r\n\r\nWith that came the King with the Hundred Knights, and all that\r\nfellowship went fiercely upon Sir Tristram. When Sir Tristram saw them\r\ncoming upon him, then he wist well he might not endure. Then as a wise\r\nknight of war, he said to Sir Galahad, the haut prince: Sir, ye show to\r\nme no knighthood, for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at\r\nonce; and as meseemeth ye be a noble knight of your hands it is great\r\nshame to you. So God me help, said Sir Galahad, there is none other way\r\nbut thou must yield thee to me, other else to die, said Sir Galahad to\r\nSir Tristram. I will rather yield me to you than die for that is more\r\nfor the might of your men than of your hands. And therewithal Sir\r\nTristram took his own sword by the point, and put the pommel in the\r\nhand of Sir Galahad.\r\n\r\nTherewithal came the King with the Hundred Knights, and hard began to\r\nassail Sir Tristram. Let be, said Sir Galahad, be ye not so hardy to\r\ntouch him, for I have given this knight his life. That is your shame,\r\nsaid the King with the Hundred Knights; hath he not slain your father\r\nand your mother? As for that, said Sir Galahad, I may not wite him\r\ngreatly, for my father had him in prison, and enforced him to do battle\r\nwith him; and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom,\r\nthat what knight came there to ask harbour his lady must needs die but\r\nif she were fairer than my mother; and if my father overcame that\r\nknight he must needs die. This was a shameful custom and usage, a\r\nknight for his harbour-asking to have such harbourage. And for this\r\ncustom I would never draw about him. So God me help, said the King,\r\nthis was a shameful custom. Truly, said Sir Galahad, so seemed me; and\r\nmeseemed it had been great pity that this knight should have been\r\nslain, for I dare say he is the noblest man that beareth life, but if\r\nit were Sir Launcelot du Lake. Now, fair knight, said Sir Galahad, I\r\nrequire thee tell me thy name, and of whence thou art, and whither thou\r\nwilt. Sir, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and from King\r\nMark of Cornwall I was sent on message unto King Anguish of Ireland,\r\nfor to fetch his daughter to be his wife, and here she is ready to go\r\nwith me into Cornwall, and her name is La Beale Isoud. And, Sir\r\nTristram, said Sir Galahad, the haut prince, well be ye found in these\r\nmarches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir Launcelot du Lake,\r\nand accompany with him, ye shall go where ye will, and your fair lady\r\nwith you; and I shall promise you never in all my days shall such\r\ncustoms be used in this castle as have been used. Sir, said Sir\r\nTristram, now I let you wit, so God me help, I weened ye had been Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake when I saw you first, and therefore I dread you the\r\nmore; and sir, I promise you, said Sir Tristram, as soon as I may I\r\nwill see Sir Launcelot and in fellowship me with him; for of all the\r\nknights of the world I most desire his fellowship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away Sir\r\nGawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine.\r\n\r\nAnd then Sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time, and took the\r\nsea. And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot and to Sir\r\nTristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was made like a giant,\r\nfought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such strokes that he swooned in\r\nhis saddle, and after that he took him by the collar and pulled him out\r\nof his saddle, and fast bound him to the saddle-bow, and so rode his\r\nway with him toward his castle. And as he rode, by fortune Sir\r\nLauncelot met with Sir Carados, and anon he knew Sir Gawaine that lay\r\nbound after him. Ah, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it\r\nwith you? Never so hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for\r\nso God me help, without ye rescue me I know no knight that may, but\r\nouther you or Sir Tristram. Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of Sir\r\nGawaine\xe2\x80\x99s words. And then Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: Lay down that\r\nknight and fight with me. Thou art but a fool, said Sir Carados, for I\r\nwill serve you in the same wise. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, spare\r\nme not, for I warn thee I will not spare thee. And then he bound Sir\r\nGawaine hand and foot, and so threw him to the ground. And then he gat\r\nhis spear of his squire, and departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his\r\ncourse. And so either met with other, and brake their spears to their\r\nhands; and then they pulled out swords, and hurtled together on\r\nhorseback more than an hour. And at the last Sir Launcelot smote Sir\r\nCarados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierced his brain-pan. So\r\nthen Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by the collar and pulled him under\r\nhis horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and then he alighted and pulled off his helm and\r\nstruck off his head. And then Sir Launcelot unbound Sir Gawaine. So\r\nthis same tale was told to Sir Galahad and to Sir Tristram:\xe2\x80\x94here may ye\r\nhear the nobleness that followeth Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir\r\nTristram, an I had not this message in hand with this fair lady, truly\r\nI would never stint or I had found Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Tristram and\r\nLa Beale Isoud went to the sea and came into Cornwall, and there all\r\nthe barons met them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of\r\nBragwaine her maid, and of Palamides.\r\n\r\nAnd anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse. But ever, as the\r\nFrench book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved ever together.\r\nThen was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and\r\nladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all\r\nother. Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within\r\na little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen\r\nIsoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine,\r\nthat was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the\r\nforest for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and\r\nhand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days. And by fortune, Sir\r\nPalamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he delivered her from the\r\ndeath, and brought her to a nunnery there beside, for to be recovered.\r\nWhen Isoud the queen missed her maiden, wit ye well she was right heavy\r\nas ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she loved her best: the\r\ncause was for she came with her out of her country. And so upon a day\r\nQueen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts, and there\r\nshe went herself unto a well and made great moan. And suddenly there\r\ncame Palamides to her, and had heard all her complaint, and said: Madam\r\nIsoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to you Dame Bragwaine\r\nsafe and sound. And the queen was so glad of his proffer that suddenly\r\nunadvised she granted all his asking. Well, Madam, said Palamides, I\r\ntrust to your promise, and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall\r\nbring her to you. I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud. And Sir\r\nPalamides rode forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he came again\r\nwith Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have come\r\nagain, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of her\r\nlife. Notwithstanding, half against her will, she went with Sir\r\nPalamides unto the queen. And when the queen saw her she was passing\r\nglad. Now, Madam, said Palamides, remember upon your promise, for I\r\nhave fulfilled my promise. Sir Palamides, said the queen, I wot not\r\nwhat is your desire, but I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you\r\nlargely, I thought none evil, nor I warn you none evil will I do.\r\nMadam, said Sir Palamides, as at this time, ye shall not know my\r\ndesire, but before my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will\r\nhave my desire that ye have promised me. And therewith the queen\r\ndeparted, and rode home to the king, and Sir Palamides rode after her.\r\nAnd when Sir Palamides came before the king, he said: Sir King, I\r\nrequire you as ye be a righteous king, that ye will judge me the right.\r\nTell me your cause, said the king, and ye shall have right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. How Palamides demanded Queen Isoud, and how Lambegus rode\r\nafter to rescue her, and of the escape of Isoud.\r\n\r\nSir, said Palamides, I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again Dame\r\nBragwaine that she had lost, upon this covenant, that she should grant\r\nme a boon that I would ask, and without grudging, outher advisement,\r\nshe granted me. What say ye, my lady? said the king. It is as he saith,\r\nso God me help, said the queen; to say thee sooth I promised him his\r\nasking for love and joy that I had to see her. Well, Madam, said the\r\nking, and if ye were hasty to grant him what boon he would ask, I will\r\nwell that ye perform your promise. Then, said Palamides, I will that ye\r\nwit that I will have your queen to lead her and govern her whereas me\r\nlist. Therewith the king stood still, and bethought him of Sir\r\nTristram, and deemed that he would rescue her. And then hastily the\r\nking answered: Take her with the adventures that shall fall of it, for\r\nas I suppose thou wilt not enjoy her no while. As for that, said\r\nPalamides, I dare right well abide the adventure. And so, to make short\r\ntale, Sir Palamides took her by the hand and said: Madam, grudge not to\r\ngo with me, for I desire nothing but your own promise. As for that,\r\nsaid the queen, I fear not greatly to go with thee, howbeit thou hast\r\nme at advantage upon my promise, for I doubt not I shall be\r\nworshipfully rescued from thee. As for that, said Sir Palamides, be it\r\nas it be may. So Queen Isoud was set behind Palamides, and rode his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAnon the king sent after Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could be\r\nfound, for he was in the forest a-hunting; for that was always his\r\ncustom, but if he used arms, to chase and to hunt in the forests. Alas,\r\nsaid the king, now I am shamed for ever, that by mine own assent my\r\nlady and my queen shall be devoured. Then came forth a knight, his name\r\nwas Lambegus, and he was a knight of Sir Tristram. My lord, said this\r\nknight, sith ye have trust in my lord, Sir Tristram, wit ye well for\r\nhis sake I will ride after your queen and rescue her, or else I shall\r\nbe beaten. Gramercy, said the king, as I live, Sir Lambegus, I shall\r\ndeserve it. And then Sir Lambegus armed him, and rode after as fast as\r\nhe might. And then within a while he overtook Sir Palamides. And then\r\nSir Palamides left the queen. What art thou, said Palamides, art thou\r\nTristram? Nay, he said, I am his servant, and my name is Sir Lambegus.\r\nThat me repenteth, said Palamides. I had liefer thou hadst been Sir\r\nTristram. I believe you well, said Lambegus, but when thou meetest with\r\nSir Tristram thou shalt have thy hands full. And then they hurtled\r\ntogether and all to-brast their spears, and then they pulled out their\r\nswords, and hewed on helms and hauberks. At the last Sir Palamides gave\r\nSir Lambegus such a wound that he fell down like a dead knight to the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThen he looked after La Beale Isoud, and then she was gone he nist\r\nwhere. Wit ye well Sir Palamides was never so heavy. So the queen ran\r\ninto the forest, and there she found a well, and therein she had\r\nthought to have drowned herself. And as good fortune would, there came\r\na knight to her that had a castle thereby, his name was Sir Adtherp.\r\nAnd when he found the queen in that mischief he rescued her, and\r\nbrought her to his castle. And when he wist what she was he armed him,\r\nand took his horse, and said he would be avenged upon Palamides; and so\r\nhe rode on till he met with him, and there Sir Palamides wounded him\r\nsore, and by force he made him to tell him the cause why he did battle\r\nwith him, and how he had led the queen unto his castle. Now bring me\r\nthere, said Palamides, or thou shalt die of my hands. Sir, said Sir\r\nAdtherp, I am so wounded I may not follow, but ride you this way and it\r\nshall bring you into my castle, and there within is the queen. Then Sir\r\nPalamides rode still till he came to the castle. And at a window La\r\nBeale Isoud saw Sir Palamides; then she made the gates to be shut\r\nstrongly. And when he saw he might not come within the castle, he put\r\noff his bridle and his saddle, and put his horse to pasture, and set\r\nhimself down at the gate like a man that was out of his wit that recked\r\nnot of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram rode after Palamides, and how he found\r\nhim and fought with him, and by the means of Isoud the battle ceased.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he was come home and wist La\r\nBeale Isoud was gone with Sir Palamides, wit ye well he was wroth out\r\nof measure. Alas, said Sir Tristram, I am this day shamed. Then he\r\ncried to Gouvernail his man: Haste thee that I were armed and on\r\nhorseback, for well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to\r\nwithstand Sir Palamides: alas that I have not been in his stead! So\r\nanon as he was armed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after\r\ninto the forest, and within a while he found his knight Lambegus almost\r\nwounded to the death; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester, and\r\ncharged him to keep him well. And then he rode forth, and there he\r\nfound Sir Adtherp sore wounded, and he told him how the queen would\r\nhave drowned herself had he not been, and how for her sake and love he\r\nhad taken upon him to do battle with Sir Palamides. Where is my lady?\r\nsaid Sir Tristram. Sir, said the knight, she is sure enough within my\r\ncastle, an she can hold her within it. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of\r\nthy great goodness. And so he rode till he came nigh to that castle;\r\nand then Sir Tristram saw where Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping,\r\nand his horse pastured fast afore him. Now go thou, Gouvernail, said\r\nSir Tristram, and bid him awake, and make him ready. So Gouvernail rode\r\nunto him and said: Sir Palamides, arise, and take to thee thine\r\nharness. But he was in such a study he heard not what Gouvernail said.\r\nSo Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram he slept, or else he was\r\nmad. Go thou again, said Sir Tristram, and bid him arise, and tell him\r\nthat I am here, his mortal foe. So Gouvernail rode again and put upon\r\nhim the butt of his spear, and said: Sir Palamides, make thee ready,\r\nfor wit ye well Sir Tristram hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is\r\nthy mortal foe. And therewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without\r\nwords, and gat his horse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly\r\nhe leapt upon, and gat his spear in his hand, and either feutred their\r\nspears and hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir\r\nPalamides over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail. Then lightly Sir Palamides put his\r\nshield afore him and drew his sword. And there began strong battle on\r\nboth parts, for both they fought for the love of one lady, and ever she\r\nlay on the walls and beheld them how they fought out of measure, and\r\neither were wounded passing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded.\r\nThus they fought tracing and traversing more than two hours, that\r\nwell-nigh for dole and sorrow La Beale Isoud swooned. Alas, she said,\r\nthat one I loved and yet do, and the other I love not, yet it were\r\ngreat pity that I should see Sir Palamides slain; for well I know by\r\nthat time the end be done Sir Palamides is but a dead knight: because\r\nhe is not christened I would be loath that he should die a Saracen. And\r\ntherewithal she came down and besought Sir Tristram to fight no more.\r\nAh, madam, said he, what mean you, will ye have me shamed? Well ye know\r\nI will be ruled by you. I will not your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud,\r\nbut I would that ye would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen\r\nPalamides. Madam, said Sir Tristram, I will leave fighting at this time\r\nfor your sake. Then she said to Sir Palamides: This shall be your\r\ncharge, that thou shalt go out of this country while I am therein. I\r\nwill obey your commandment, said Sir Palamides, the which is sore\r\nagainst my will. Then take thy way, said La Beale Isoud, unto the court\r\nof King Arthur, and there recommend me unto Queen Guenever, and tell\r\nher that I send her word that there be within this land but four\r\nlovers, that is, Sir Launcelot du Lake and Queen Guenever, and Sir\r\nTristram de Liones and Queen Isoud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram brought Queen Isoud home, and of the\r\ndebate of King Mark and Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Palamides departed with great heaviness. And Sir Tristram\r\ntook the queen and brought her again to King Mark, and then was there\r\nmade great joy of her home-coming. Who was cherished but Sir Tristram!\r\nThen Sir Tristram let fetch Sir Lambegus, his knight, from the\r\nforester\xe2\x80\x99s house, and it was long or he was whole, but at the last he\r\nwas well recovered. Thus they lived with joy and play a long while. But\r\never Sir Andred, that was nigh cousin to Sir Tristram, lay in a watch\r\nto wait betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, for to take them and\r\nslander them. So upon a day Sir Tristram talked with La Beale Isoud in\r\na window, and that espied Sir Andred, and told it to the King. Then\r\nKing Mark took a sword in his hand and came to Sir Tristram, and called\r\nhim false traitor, and would have stricken him. But Sir Tristram was\r\nnigh him, and ran under his sword, and took it out of his hand. And\r\nthen the King cried: Where are my knights and my men? I charge you slay\r\nthis traitor. But at that time there was not one would move for his\r\nwords. When Sir Tristram saw that there was not one would be against\r\nhim, he shook the sword to the king, and made countenance as though he\r\nwould have stricken him. And then King Mark fled, and Sir Tristram\r\nfollowed him, and smote upon him five or six strokes flatling on the\r\nneck, that he made him to fall upon the nose. And then Sir Tristram\r\nyede his way and armed him, and took his horse and his man, and so he\r\nrode into that forest.\r\n\r\nAnd there upon a day Sir Tristram met with two brethren that were\r\nknights with King Mark, and there he struck off the head of the one,\r\nand wounded the other to the death; and he made him to bear his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s head in his helm unto the king, and thirty more there he\r\nwounded. And when that knight came before the king to say his message,\r\nhe there died afore the king and the queen. Then King Mark called his\r\ncouncil unto him, and asked advice of his barons what was best to do\r\nwith Sir Tristram. Sir, said the barons, in especial Sir Dinas, the\r\nSeneschal, Sir, we will give you counsel for to send for Sir Tristram,\r\nfor we will that ye wit many men will hold with Sir Tristram an he were\r\nhard bestead. And sir, said Sir Dinas, ye shall understand that Sir\r\nTristram is called peerless and makeless of any Christian knight, and\r\nof his might and hardiness we knew none so good a knight, but if it be\r\nSir Launcelot du Lake. And if he depart from your court and go to King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, wit ye well he will get him such friends there that he\r\nwill not set by your malice. And therefore, sir, I counsel you to take\r\nhim to your grace. I will well, said the king, that he be sent for,\r\nthat we may be friends. Then the barons sent for Sir Tristram under a\r\nsafe conduct. And so when Sir Tristram came to the king he was welcome,\r\nand no rehearsal was made, and there was game and play. And then the\r\nking and the queen went a-hunting, and Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir\r\nTristram at the request of King Mark smote his horse down.\r\n\r\nThe king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in that\r\nforest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and jousting, for\r\nthere were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto all them that came\r\nin at that time. And there by fortune came Sir Lamorak de Galis and Sir\r\nDriant; and there Sir Driant jousted right well, but at the last he had\r\na fall. Then Sir Lamorak proffered to joust. And when he began he fared\r\nso with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he\r\ngave him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt. I marvel, said King\r\nMark, what knight he is that doth such deeds of arms. Sir, said Sir\r\nTristram, I know him well for a noble knight as few now be living, and\r\nhis name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. It were great shame, said the king,\r\nthat he should go thus away, unless that some of you meet with him\r\nbetter. Sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were no worship for a\r\nnoble man to have ado with him: and for because at this time he hath\r\ndone over much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it\r\nwere great shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time,\r\ninsomuch as he and his horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that\r\nhe hath done this day, an they be well considered, it were enough for\r\nSir Launcelot du Lake. As for that, said King Mark, I require you, as\r\nye love me and my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and\r\njoust with Sir Lamorak de Galis. Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a\r\nthing that is against knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give\r\nhim a fall, for it is no mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and\r\nso is not his horse and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for\r\ngreat unkindness, for ever one good knight is loath to take another at\r\ndisadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require me so\r\nwill I do, and obey your commandment.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him forth,\r\nand there Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the might of his\r\nown spear, and of Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s spear, Sir Lamorak\xe2\x80\x99s horse fell to the\r\nearth, and he sitting in the saddle. Then anon as lightly as he might\r\nhe avoided the saddle and his horse, and put his shield afore him and\r\ndrew his sword. And then he bade Sir Tristram: Alight, thou knight, an\r\nthou durst. Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will no more have ado with thee,\r\nfor I have done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship.\r\nAs for that, said Sir Lamorak, I can thee no thank; since thou hast\r\nfor-jousted me on horseback I require thee and I beseech thee, an thou\r\nbe Sir Tristram, fight with me on foot. I will not so, said Sir\r\nTristram; and wit ye well my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and well I\r\nknow ye be Sir Lamorak de Galis, and this that I have done to you was\r\nagainst my will, but I was required thereto; but to say that I will do\r\nat your request as at this time, I will have no more ado with you, for\r\nme shameth of that I have done. As for the shame, said Sir Lamorak, on\r\nthy part or on mine, bear thou it an thou wilt, for though a mare\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nhath failed me, now a queen\xe2\x80\x99s son shall not fail thee; and therefore,\r\nan thou be such a knight as men call thee, I require thee, alight, and\r\nfight with me. Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, I understand your heart\r\nis great, and cause why ye have, to say thee sooth; for it would grieve\r\nme an any knight should keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary\r\nknight, for that knight nor horse was never formed that alway might\r\nstand or endure. And therefore, said Sir Tristram, I will not have ado\r\nwith you, for me forthinketh of that I have done. As for that, said Sir\r\nLamorak, I shall quit you, an ever I see my time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Lamorak sent an horn to King Mark in despite of\r\nSir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram was driven into a chapel.\r\n\r\nSo he departed from him with Sir Driant, and by the way they met with a\r\nknight that was sent from Morgan le Fay unto King Arthur; and this\r\nknight had a fair horn harnessed with gold, and the horn had such a\r\nvirtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink of that horn but\r\nif she were true to her husband, and if she were false she should spill\r\nall the drink, and if she were true to her lord she might drink\r\npeaceable. And because of the Queen Guenever, and in the despite of Sir\r\nLauncelot, this horn was sent unto King Arthur; and by force Sir\r\nLamorak made that knight to tell all the cause why he bare that horn.\r\nNow shalt thou bear this horn, said Lamorak, unto King Mark, or else\r\nchoose thou to die for it; for I tell thee plainly, in despite and\r\nreproof of Sir Tristram thou shalt bear that horn unto King Mark, his\r\nuncle, and say thou to him that I sent it him for to assay his lady,\r\nand if she be true to him he shall prove her. So the knight went his\r\nway unto King Mark, and brought him that rich horn, and said that Sir\r\nLamorak sent it him, and thereto he told him the virtue of that horn.\r\nThen the king made Queen Isoud to drink thereof, and an hundred ladies,\r\nand there were but four ladies of all those that drank clean. Alas,\r\nsaid King Mark, this is a great despite, and sware a great oath that\r\nshe should be burnt and the other ladies.\r\n\r\nThen the barons gathered them together, and said plainly they would not\r\nhave those ladies burnt for an horn made by sorcery, that came from as\r\nfalse a sorceress and witch as then was living. For that horn did never\r\ngood, but caused strife and debate, and always in her days she had been\r\nan enemy to all true lovers. So there were many knights made their\r\navow, an ever they met with Morgan le Fay, that they would show her\r\nshort courtesy. Also Sir Tristram was passing wroth that Sir Lamorak\r\nsent that horn unto King Mark, for well he knew that it was done in the\r\ndespite of him. And therefore he thought to quite Sir Lamorak.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram used daily and nightly to go to Queen Isoud when he\r\nmight, and ever Sir Andred his cousin watched him night and day for to\r\ntake him with La Beale Isoud. And so upon a night Sir Andred espied the\r\nhour and the time when Sir Tristram went to his lady. Then Sir Andred\r\ngat unto him twelve knights, and at midnight he set upon Sir Tristram\r\nsecretly and suddenly and there Sir Tristram was taken naked abed with\r\nLa Beale Isoud, and then was he bound hand and foot, and so was he kept\r\nuntil day. And then by the assent of King Mark, and of Sir Andred, and\r\nof some of the barons, Sir Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood\r\nupon the sea rocks, there for to take his judgment: and so he was led\r\nbounden with forty knights. And when Sir Tristram saw that there was\r\nnone other boot but needs that he must die, then said he: Fair lords,\r\nremember what I have done for the country of Cornwall, and in what\r\njeopardy I have been in for the weal of you all; for when I fought for\r\nthe truage of Cornwall with Sir Marhaus, the good knight, I was\r\npromised for to be better rewarded, when ye all refused to take the\r\nbattle; therefore, as ye be good gentle knights, see me not thus\r\nshamefully to die, for it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me\r\ndie; for I dare say, said Sir Tristram, that I never met with no knight\r\nbut I was as good as he, or better. Fie upon thee, said Sir Andred,\r\nfalse traitor that thou art, with thine avaunting; for all thy boast\r\nthou shalt die this day. O Andred, Andred, said Sir Tristram, thou\r\nshouldst be my kinsman, and now thou art to me full unfriendly, but an\r\nthere were no more but thou and I, thou wouldst not put me to death.\r\nNo! said Sir Andred, and therewith he drew his sword, and would have\r\nslain him.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Tristram saw him make such countenance he looked upon both his\r\nhands that were fast bounden unto two knights, and suddenly he pulled\r\nthem both to him, and unwrast his hands, and then he leapt unto his\r\ncousin, Sir Andred, and wrested his sword out of his hands; then he\r\nsmote Sir Andred that he fell to the earth, and so Sir Tristram fought\r\ntill that he had killed ten knights. So then Sir Tristram gat the\r\nchapel and kept it mightily. Then the cry was great, and the people\r\ndrew fast unto Sir Andred, mo than an hundred. When Sir Tristram saw\r\nthe people draw unto him, he remembered he was naked, and sperd fast\r\nthe chapel door, and brake the bars of a window, and so he leapt out\r\nand fell upon the crags in the sea. And so at that time Sir Andred nor\r\nnone of his fellows might get to him, at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. How Sir Tristram was holpen by his men, and of Queen\r\nIsoud which was put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt.\r\n\r\nSo when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir\r\nSentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s men, sought their\r\nmaster. When they heard he was escaped then they were passing glad; and\r\non the rocks they found him, and with towels they pulled him up. And\r\nthen Sir Tristram asked them where was La Beale Isoud, for he weened\r\nshe had been had away of Andred\xe2\x80\x99s people. Sir, said Gouvernail, she is\r\nput in a lazar-cote. Alas, said Sir Tristram, this is a full ungoodly\r\nplace for such a fair lady, and if I may she shall not be long there.\r\nAnd so he took his men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and fetched\r\nher away, and brought her into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir\r\nTristram there abode with her. So the good knight bade his men go from\r\nhim: For at this time I may not help you. So they departed all save\r\nGouvernail. And so upon a day Sir Tristram yede into the forest for to\r\ndisport him, and then it happened that there he fell sleep; and there\r\ncame a man that Sir Tristram aforehand had slain his brother, and when\r\nthis man had found him he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow,\r\nand Sir Tristram leapt up and killed that man. And in the meantime it\r\nwas told King Mark how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in that\r\nsame manor, and as soon as ever he might thither he came with many\r\nknights to slay Sir Tristram. And when he came there he found him gone;\r\nand there he took La Beale Isoud home with him, and kept her strait\r\nthat by no means never she might wit nor send unto Tristram, nor he\r\nunto her. And then when Sir Tristram came toward the old manor he found\r\nthe track of many horses, and thereby he wist his lady was gone. And\r\nthen Sir Tristram took great sorrow, and endured with great pain long\r\ntime, for the arrow that he was hurt withal was envenomed.\r\n\r\nThen by the mean of La Beale Isoud she told a lady that was cousin unto\r\nDame Bragwaine, and she came to Sir Tristram, and told him that he\r\nmight not be whole by no means. For thy lady, La Beale Isoud, may not\r\nhelp thee, therefore she biddeth you haste into Brittany to King Howel,\r\nand there ye shall find his daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she\r\nshall help thee. Then Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping,\r\nand so sailed into Brittany. And when King Howel wist that it was Sir\r\nTristram he was full glad of him. Sir, he said, I am come into this\r\ncountry to have help of your daughter, for it is told me that there is\r\nnone other may heal me but she; and so within a while she healed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram served in war King Howel of Brittany,\r\nand slew his adversary in the field.\r\n\r\nThere was an earl that hight Grip, and this earl made great war upon\r\nthe king, and put the king to the worse, and besieged him. And on a\r\ntime Sir Kehydius, that was son to King Howel, as he issued out he was\r\nsore wounded, nigh to the death. Then Gouvernail went to the king and\r\nsaid: Sir, I counsel you to desire my lord, Sir Tristram, as in your\r\nneed to help you. I will do by your counsel, said the king. And so he\r\nyede unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him in his wars to help him: For my\r\nson, Sir Kehydius, may not go into the field. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I\r\nwill go to the field and do what I may. Then Sir Tristram issued out of\r\nthe town with such fellowship as he might make, and did such deeds that\r\nall Brittany spake of him. And then, at the last, by great might and\r\nforce, he slew the Earl Grip with his own hands, and more than an\r\nhundred knights he slew that day. And then Sir Tristram was received\r\nworshipfully with procession. Then King Howel embraced him in his arms,\r\nand said: Sir Tristram, all my kingdom I will resign to thee. God\r\ndefend, said Sir Tristram, for I am beholden unto you for your\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s sake to do for you.\r\n\r\nThen by the great means of King Howel and Kehydius his son, by great\r\nproffers, there grew great love betwixt Isoud and Sir Tristram, for\r\nthat lady was both good and fair, and a woman of noble blood and fame.\r\nAnd for because Sir Tristram had such cheer and riches, and all other\r\npleasaunce that he had, almost he had forsaken La Beale Isoud. And so\r\nupon a time Sir Tristram agreed to wed Isoud la Blanche Mains. And at\r\nthe last they were wedded, and solemnly held their marriage. And so\r\nwhen they were abed both Sir Tristram remembered him of his old lady La\r\nBeale Isoud. And then he took such a thought suddenly that he was all\r\ndismayed, and other cheer made he none but with clipping and kissing;\r\nas for other fleshly lusts Sir Tristram never thought nor had ado with\r\nher: such mention maketh the French book; also it maketh mention that\r\nthe lady weened there had been no pleasure but kissing and clipping.\r\nAnd in the meantime there was a knight in Brittany, his name was\r\nSuppinabiles, and he came over the sea into England, and then he came\r\ninto the court of King Arthur, and there he met with Sir Launcelot du\r\nLake, and told him of the marriage of Sir Tristram. Then said Sir\r\nLauncelot: Fie upon him, untrue knight to his lady, that so noble a\r\nknight as Sir Tristram is should be found to his first lady false, La\r\nBeale Isoud, Queen of Cornwall; but say ye him this, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, that of all knights in the world I loved him most, and had\r\nmost joy of him, and all was for his noble deeds; and let him wit the\r\nlove between him and me is done for ever, and that I give him warning\r\nfrom this day forth as his mortal enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. How Sir Suppinabiles told Sir Tristram how he was\r\ndefamed in the court of King Arthur, and of Sir Lamorak.\r\n\r\nThen departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he found\r\nSir Tristram, and told him that he had been in King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\nThen said Sir Tristram: Heard ye anything of me? So God me help, said\r\nSir Suppinabiles, there I heard Sir Launcelot speak of you great shame,\r\nand that ye be a false knight to your lady and he bade me do you to wit\r\nthat he will be your mortal enemy in every place where he may meet you.\r\nThat me repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in\r\nhis fellowship. So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that\r\nnoble knights should defame him for the sake of his lady. And in this\r\nmeanwhile La Beale Isoud made a letter unto Queen Guenever, complaining\r\nher of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how he had wedded the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter of Brittany. Queen Guenever sent her another letter, and bade\r\nher be of good cheer, for she should have joy after sorrow, for Sir\r\nTristram was so noble a knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies\r\nwould make such noble men to wed them. But in the end, Queen Guenever\r\nsaid, it shall be thus, that he shall hate her, and love you better\r\nthan ever he did to-fore.\r\n\r\nSo leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak de\r\nGalis, that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished all, save\r\nSir Lamorak and his squire; and there he swam mightily, and fishers of\r\nthe Isle of Servage took him up, and his squire was drowned, and the\r\nshipmen had great labour to save Sir Lamorak\xe2\x80\x99s life, for all the\r\ncomfort that they could do.\r\n\r\nAnd the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great mighty\r\ngiant. And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nin no wise he would do them favour. And these fishers told Sir Lamorak\r\nall the guise of Sir Nabon; how there came never knight of King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s but he destroyed him. And at the last battle that he did was\r\nslain Sir Nanowne le Petite, the which he put to a shameful death in\r\ndespite of King Arthur, for he was drawn limb-meal. That forthinketh\r\nme, said Sir Lamorak, for that knight\xe2\x80\x99s death, for he was my cousin;\r\nand if I were at mine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his\r\ndeath. Peace, said the fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye\r\ndepart from hence Sir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or else\r\nwe should die for your sake. So that I be whole, said Lamorak, of my\r\ndisease that I have taken in the sea, I will that ye tell him that I am\r\na knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, for I was never afeard to reneye my lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his wife arrived in Wales, and\r\nhow he met there with Sir Lamorak.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he took a little barget,\r\nand his wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius her brother, to\r\nplay them in the coasts. And when they were from the land, there was a\r\nwind drove them in to the coast of Wales upon this Isle of Servage,\r\nwhereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the barget all to-rove; and there\r\nDame Isoud was hurt; and as well as they might they gat into the\r\nforest, and there by a well he saw Segwarides and a damosel. And then\r\neither saluted other. Sir, said Segwarides, I know you for Sir Tristram\r\nde Liones, the man in the world that I have most cause to hate, because\r\nye departed the love between me and my wife; but as for that, said Sir\r\nSegwarides, I will never hate a noble knight for a light lady; and\r\ntherefore, I pray you, be my friend, and I will be yours unto my power;\r\nfor wit ye well ye are hard bestead in this valley, and we shall have\r\nenough to do either of us to succour other. And then Sir Segwarides\r\nbrought Sir Tristram to a lady thereby that was born in Cornwall, and\r\nshe told him all the perils of that valley, and how there came never\r\nknight there but he were taken prisoner or slain. Wit you well, fair\r\nlady, said Sir Tristram, that I slew Sir Marhaus and delivered Cornwall\r\nfrom the truage of Ireland, and I am he that delivered the King of\r\nIreland from Sir Blamore de Ganis, and I am he that beat Sir Palamides;\r\nand wit ye well I am Sir Tristram de Liones, that by the grace of God\r\nshall deliver this woful Isle of Servage. So Sir Tristram was well\r\neased.\r\n\r\nThen one told him there was a knight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s that was wrecked\r\non the rocks. What is his name? said Sir Tristram. We wot not, said the\r\nfishers, but he keepeth it no counsel but that he is a knight of King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s, and by the mighty lord of this isle he setteth nought. I pray\r\nyou, said Sir Tristram, an ye may, bring him hither that I may see him,\r\nand if he be any of the knights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s I shall know him. Then the\r\nlady prayed the fishers to bring him to her place. So on the morrow\r\nthey brought him thither in a fisher\xe2\x80\x99s raiment; and as soon as Sir\r\nTristram saw him he smiled upon him and knew him well, but he knew not\r\nSir Tristram. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth by your cheer ye\r\nhave been diseased but late, and also methinketh I should know you\r\nheretofore. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, that ye have seen me and met\r\nwith me. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name. Upon a\r\ncovenant I will tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that is, that ye will tell\r\nme whether ye be lord of this island or no, that is called Nabon le\r\nNoire. Forsooth, said Sir Tristram, I am not he, nor I hold not of him;\r\nI am his foe as well as ye be, and so shall I be found or I depart out\r\nof this isle. Well, said Sir Lamorak, since ye have said so largely\r\nunto me, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son unto King Pellinore.\r\nForsooth, I trow well, said Sir Tristram, for an ye said other I know\r\nthe contrary. What are ye, said Sir Lamorak, that knoweth me? I am Sir\r\nTristram de Liones. Ah, sir, remember ye not of the fall ye did give me\r\nonce, and after ye refused me to fight on foot. That was not for fear I\r\nhad of you, said Sir Tristram, but me shamed at that time to have more\r\nado with you, for meseemed ye had enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my\r\nkindness many ladies ye put to a reproof when ye sent the horn from\r\nMorgan le Fay to King Mark, whereas ye did this in despite of me. Well,\r\nsaid he, an it were to do again, so would I do, for I had liefer strife\r\nand debate fell in King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s court rather than Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, for\r\nthe honour of both courts be not alike. As to that, said Sir Tristram,\r\nI know well; but that that was done it was for despite of me, but all\r\nyour malice, I thank God, hurt not greatly. Therefore, said Sir\r\nTristram, ye shall leave all your malice, and so will I, and let us\r\nassay how we may win worship between you and me upon this giant Sir\r\nNabon le Noire that is lord of this island, to destroy him. Sir, said\r\nSir Lamorak, now I understand your knighthood, it may not be false that\r\nall men say, for of your bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights\r\nye are peerless, and for your courtesy and gentleness I showed you\r\nungentleness, and that now me repenteth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame\r\nhim, and made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that all\r\nthe people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth day after.\r\nAnd the same day the son of Nabon should be made knight, and all the\r\nknights of that valley and thereabout should be there to joust, and all\r\nthose of the realm of Logris should be there to joust with them of\r\nNorth Wales: and thither came five hundred knights, and they of the\r\ncountry brought thither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir\r\nKehydius, and Sir Segwarides, for they durst none otherwise do; and\r\nthen Sir Nabon lent Sir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesire, and Sir Lamorak jousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon\r\nand all the people said there was never knight that ever they saw do\r\nsuch deeds of arms; for, as the French book saith, he for-jousted all\r\nthat were there, for the most part of five hundred knights, that none\r\nabode him in his saddle.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play: For I saw never no\r\nknight do so much upon a day. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, play as I\r\nmay, but I am weary and sore bruised. And there either gat a spear, but\r\nNabon would not encounter with Sir Lamorak, but smote his horse in the\r\nforehead, and so slew him; and then Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and\r\nturned his shield and drew his sword, and there began strong battle on\r\nfoot. But Sir Lamorak was so sore bruised and short breathed, that he\r\ntraced and traversed somewhat aback. Fair fellow, said Sir Nabon, hold\r\nthy hand and I shall show thee more courtesy than ever I showed knight,\r\nbecause I have seen this day thy noble knighthood, and therefore stand\r\nthou by, and I will wit whether any of thy fellows will have ado with\r\nme. Then when Sir Tristram heard that, he stepped forth and said:\r\nNabon, lend me horse and sure armour, and I will have ado with thee.\r\nWell, fellow, said Sir Nabon, go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm thee\r\nof the best thou findest there, and I shall play a marvellous play with\r\nthee. Then said Sir Tristram: Look ye play well, or else peradventure I\r\nshall learn you a new play. That is well said, fellow, said Sir Nabon.\r\nSo when Sir Tristram was armed as him liked best, and well shielded and\r\nsworded, he dressed to him on foot; for well he knew that Sir Nabon\r\nwould not abide a stroke with a spear, therefore he would slay all\r\nknights\xe2\x80\x99 horses. Now, fair fellow, Sir Nabon, let us play. So then they\r\nfought long on foot, tracing and traversing, smiting and foining long\r\nwithout any rest. At the last Sir Nabon prayed him to tell him his\r\nname. Sir Nabon, I tell thee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a\r\nknight of Cornwall under King Mark. Thou art welcome, said Sir Nabon,\r\nfor of all knights I have most desired to fight with thee or with Sir\r\nLauncelot.\r\n\r\nSo then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristram slew Sir Nabon,\r\nand so forthwith he leapt to his son, and struck off his head; and then\r\nall the country said they would hold of Sir Tristram. Nay, said Sir\r\nTristram, I will not so; here is a worshipful knight, Sir Lamorak de\r\nGalis, that for me he shall be lord of this country, for he hath done\r\nhere great deeds of arms. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will not be lord of\r\nthis country, for I have not deserved it as well as ye, therefore give\r\nye it where ye will, for I will none have. Well, said Sir Tristram,\r\nsince ye nor I will not have it, let us give it to him that hath not so\r\nwell deserved it. Do as ye list, said Segwarides, for the gift is\r\nyours, for I will none have an I had deserved it. So was it given to\r\nSegwarides, whereof he thanked them; and so was he lord, and\r\nworshipfully he did govern it. And then Sir Segwarides delivered all\r\nprisoners, and set good governance in that valley; and so he returned\r\ninto Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale Isoud how Sir Tristram\r\nhad advanced him to the Isle of Servage, and there he proclaimed in all\r\nCornwall of all the adventures of these two knights, so was it openly\r\nknown. But full woe was La Beale Isoud when she heard tell that Sir\r\nTristram was wedded to Isoud la Blanche Mains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. How Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Tristram, and how he met\r\nwith Sir Frol, and after with Sir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nSo turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that rode toward Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, and Sir\r\nTristram\xe2\x80\x99s wife and Kehydius took a vessel and sailed into Brittany,\r\nunto King Howel, where he was welcome. And when he heard of these\r\nadventures they marvelled of his noble deeds. Now turn we unto Sir\r\nLamorak, that when he was departed from Sir Tristram he rode out of the\r\nforest, till he came to an hermitage. When the hermit saw him, he asked\r\nhim from whence he came. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I come from this\r\nvalley. Sir, said the hermit: thereof I marvel. For this twenty winter\r\nI saw never no knight pass this country but he was either slain or\r\nvillainously wounded, or pass as a poor prisoner. Those ill customs,\r\nsaid Sir Lamorak, are fordone, for Sir Tristram slew your lord, Sir\r\nNabon, and his son. Then was the hermit glad, and all his brethren, for\r\nhe said there was never such a tyrant among Christian men. And\r\ntherefore, said the hermit, this valley and franchise we will hold of\r\nSir Tristram.\r\n\r\nSo on the morrow Sir Lamorak departed; and as he rode he saw four\r\nknights fight against one, and that one knight defended him well, but\r\nat the last the four knights had him down. And then Sir Lamorak went\r\nbetwixt them, and asked them why they would slay that one knight, and\r\nsaid it was shame, four against one. Thou shalt well wit, said the four\r\nknights, that he is false. That is your tale, said Sir Lamorak, and\r\nwhen I hear him also speak, I will say as ye say. Then said Lamorak:\r\nAh, knight, can ye not excuse you, but that ye are a false knight. Sir,\r\nsaid he, yet can I excuse me both with my word and with my hands, that\r\nI will make good upon one of the best of them, my body to his body.\r\nThen spake they all at once: We will not jeopardy our bodies as for\r\nthee. But wit thou well, they said, an King Arthur were here himself,\r\nit should not lie in his power to save his life. That is too much said,\r\nsaid Sir Lamorak, but many speak behind a man more than they will say\r\nto his face; and because of your words ye shall understand that I am\r\none of the simplest of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court; in the worship of my lord\r\nnow do your best, and in despite of you I shall rescue him. And then\r\nthey lashed all at once to Sir Lamorak, but anon at two strokes Sir\r\nLamorak had slain two of them, and then the other two fled. So then Sir\r\nLamorak turned again to that knight, and asked him his name. Sir, he\r\nsaid, my name is Sir Frol of the Out Isles. Then he rode with Sir\r\nLamorak and bare him company.\r\n\r\nAnd as they rode by the way they saw a seemly knight riding against\r\nthem, and all in white. Ah, said Frol, yonder knight jousted late with\r\nme and smote me down, therefore I will joust with him. Ye shall not do\r\nso, said Sir Lamorak, by my counsel, an ye will tell me your quarrel,\r\nwhether ye jousted at his request, or he at yours. Nay, said Sir Frol,\r\nI jousted with him at my request. Sir, said Lamorak, then will I\r\ncounsel you deal no more with him, for meseemeth by his countenance he\r\nshould be a noble knight, and no japer; for methinketh he should be of\r\nthe Table Round. Therefore I will not spare, said Sir Frol. And then he\r\ncried and said: Sir knight, make thee ready to joust. That needeth not,\r\nsaid the White Knight, for I have no lust to joust with thee; but yet\r\nthey feutred their spears, and the White Knight overthrew Sir Frol, and\r\nthen he rode his way a soft pace. Then Sir Lamorak rode after him, and\r\nprayed him to tell him his name: For meseemeth ye should be of the\r\nfellowship of the Round Table. Upon a covenant, said he, I will tell\r\nyou my name, so that ye will not discover my name, and also that ye\r\nwill tell me yours. Then, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. And\r\nmy name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then they put up their swords, and\r\nkissed heartily together, and either made great joy of other. Sir, said\r\nSir Lamorak, an it please you I will do you service. God defend, said\r\nLauncelot, that any of so noble a blood as ye be should do me service.\r\nThen he said: More, I am in a quest that I must do myself alone. Now\r\nGod speed you, said Sir Lamorak, and so they departed. Then Sir Lamorak\r\ncame to Sir Frol and horsed him again. What knight is that? said Sir\r\nFrol. Sir, he said, it is not for you to know, nor it is no point of my\r\ncharge. Ye are the more uncourteous, said Sir Frol, and therefore I\r\nwill depart from you. Ye may do as ye list, said Sir Lamorak, and yet\r\nby my company ye have saved the fairest flower of your garland; so they\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Frol, and of the courteous\r\nfighting with Sir Belliance his brother.\r\n\r\nThen within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a well\r\nsleeping, and his lady sat with him and waked. Right so came Sir\r\nGawaine and took the knight\xe2\x80\x99s lady, and set her up behind his squire.\r\nSo Sir Lamorak rode after Sir Gawaine, and said: Sir Gawaine, turn\r\nagain. And then said Sir Gawaine: What will ye do with me? for I am\r\nnephew unto King Arthur. Sir, said he, for that cause I will spare you,\r\nelse that lady should abide with me, or else ye should joust with me.\r\nThen Sir Gawaine turned him and ran to him that ought the lady, with\r\nhis spear, but the knight with pure might smote down Sir Gawaine, and\r\ntook his lady with him. All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to himself:\r\nBut I revenge my fellow he will say of me dishonour in King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt. Then Sir Lamorak returned and proffered that knight to joust.\r\nSir, said he, I am ready. And there they came together with all their\r\nmight, and there Sir Lamorak smote the knight through both sides that\r\nhe fell to the earth dead.\r\n\r\nThen that lady rode to that knight\xe2\x80\x99s brother that hight Belliance le\r\nOrgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she told him how his brother\r\nwas slain. Alas, said he, I will be revenged. And so he horsed him, and\r\narmed him, and within a while he overtook Sir Lamorak, and bade him:\r\nTurn and leave that lady, for thou and I must play a new play; for thou\r\nhast slain my brother Sir Frol, that was a better knight than ever wert\r\nthou. It might well be, said Sir Lamorak, but this day in the field I\r\nwas found the better. So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and\r\nturned their shields, and drew their swords, and fought mightily as\r\nnoble knights proved, by the space of two hours. So then Sir Belliance\r\nprayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak\r\nde Galis. Ah, said Sir Belliance, thou art the man in the world that I\r\nmost hate, for I slew my sons for thy sake, where I saved thy life, and\r\nnow thou hast slain my brother Sir Frol. Alas, how should I be accorded\r\nwith thee; therefore defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none\r\nother remedy. Alas, said Sir Lamorak, full well me ought to know you,\r\nfor ye are the man that most have done for me. And therewithal Sir\r\nLamorak kneeled down, and besought him of grace. Arise, said Sir\r\nBelliance, or else thereas thou kneelest I shall slay thee. That shall\r\nnot need, said Sir Lamorak, for I will yield me unto you, not for fear\r\nof you, nor for your strength, but your goodness maketh me full loath\r\nto have ado with you; wherefore I require you for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and for\r\nthe honour of knighthood, forgive me all that I have offended unto you.\r\nAlas, said Belliance, leave thy kneeling, or else I shall slay thee\r\nwithout mercy.\r\n\r\nThen they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that all\r\nthe ground was bloody thereas they fought. And at the last Belliance\r\nwithdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a little hill, for he\r\nwas so faint for bleeding that he might not stand. Then Sir Lamorak\r\nthrew his shield upon his back, and asked him what cheer. Well, said\r\nSir Belliance. Ah, Sir, yet shall I show you favour in your mal-ease.\r\nAh, Knight Sir Belliance, said Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for an I\r\nhad had thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay\r\nthee; but thy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs\r\nforgive thee mine evil will. And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and\r\nunlaced first his umberere, and then his own, and then either kissed\r\nother with weeping tears. Then Sir Lamorak led Sir Belliance to an\r\nabbey fast by, and there Sir Lamorak would not depart from Belliance\r\ntill he was whole. And then they sware together that none of them\r\nshould never fight against other. So Sir Lamorak departed and went to\r\nthe court of King Arthur.\r\n\r\n Here leave we of Sir Lamorak and of Sir Tristram. And here beginneth\r\n the history of La Cote Male Taile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. How a young man came into the court of King Arthur, and how\r\nSir Kay called him in scorn La Cote Male Taile.\r\n\r\nAt the court of King Arthur there came a young man and bigly made, and\r\nhe was richly beseen: and he desired to be made knight of the king, but\r\nhis over-garment sat over-thwartly, howbeit it was rich cloth of gold.\r\nWhat is your name? said King Arthur. Sir, said he, my name is Breunor\r\nle Noire, and within short space ye shall know that I am of good kin.\r\nIt may well be, said Sir Kay, the Seneschal, but in mockage ye shall be\r\ncalled La Cote Male Taile, that is as much to say, the evil-shapen\r\ncoat. It is a great thing that thou askest, said the king; and for what\r\ncause wearest thou that rich coat? tell me, for I can well think for\r\nsome cause it is. Sir, he answered, I had a father, a noble knight, and\r\nas he rode a-hunting, upon a day it happed him to lay him down to\r\nsleep; and there came a knight that had been long his enemy, and when\r\nhe saw he was fast asleep he all to-hew him; and this same coat had my\r\nfather on the same time; and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon\r\nme, for the strokes be on it as I found it, and never shall be amended\r\nfor me. Thus to have my father\xe2\x80\x99s death in remembrance I wear this coat\r\ntill I be revenged; and because ye are called the most noblest king of\r\nthe world I come to you that ye should make me knight. Sir, said Sir\r\nLamorak and Sir Gaheris, it were well done to make him knight; for him\r\nbeseemeth well of person and of countenance, that he shall prove a good\r\nman, and a good knight, and a mighty; for, Sir, an ye be remembered,\r\neven such one was Sir Launcelot du Lake when he came first into this\r\ncourt, and full few of us knew from whence he came; and now is he\r\nproved the man of most worship in the world; and all your court and all\r\nyour Round Table is by Sir Launcelot worshipped and amended more than\r\nby any knight now living. That is truth, said the king, and to-morrow\r\nat your request I shall make him knight.\r\n\r\nSo on the morrow there was an hart found, and thither rode King Arthur\r\nwith a company of his knights to slay the hart. And this young man that\r\nSir Kay named La Cote Male Taile was there left behind with Queen\r\nGuenever; and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a\r\nstrong tower of stone, and it happened that he at that time brake\r\nloose, and came hurling afore the queen and her knights. And when the\r\nqueen saw the lion she cried and fled, and prayed her knights to rescue\r\nher. And there was none of them all but twelve that abode, and all the\r\nother fled. Then said La Cote Male Taile: Now I see well that all\r\ncoward knights be not dead; and therewithal he drew his sword and\r\ndressed him afore the lion. And that lion gaped wide and came upon him\r\nramping to have slain him. And he then smote him in the midst of the\r\nhead such a mighty stroke that it clave his head in sunder, and dashed\r\nto the earth. Then was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay\r\nnamed by scorn La Cote Male Taile had slain the lion. With that the\r\nking came home. And when the queen told him of that adventure, he was\r\nwell pleased, and said: Upon pain of mine head he shall prove a noble\r\nman and a faithful knight, and true of his promise: then the king\r\nforthwithal made him knight. Now Sir, said this young knight, I require\r\nyou and all the knights of your court, that ye call me by none other\r\nname but La Cote Male Taile: in so much as Sir Kay hath so named me so\r\nwill I be called. I assent me well thereto, said the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How a damosel came into the court and desired a knight to\r\ntake on him an enquest, which La Cote Male Taile emprised.\r\n\r\nThen that same day there came a damosel into the court, and she brought\r\nwith her a great black shield, with a white hand in the midst holding a\r\nsword. Other picture was there none in that shield. When King Arthur\r\nsaw her he asked her from whence she came and what she would. Sir, she\r\nsaid, I have ridden long and many a day with this shield many ways, and\r\nfor this cause I am come to your court: there was a good knight that\r\nought this shield, and this knight had undertaken a great deed of arms\r\nto enchieve it; and so it misfortuned him another strong knight met\r\nwith him by sudden adventure, and there they fought long, and either\r\nwounded other passing sore; and they were so weary that they left that\r\nbattle even hand. So this knight that ought this shield saw none other\r\nway but he must die; and then he commanded me to bear this shield to\r\nthe court of King Arthur, he requiring and praying some good knight to\r\ntake this shield, and that he would fulfil the quest that he was in.\r\nNow what say ye to this quest? said King Arthur; is there any of you\r\nhere that will take upon him to wield this shield? Then was there not\r\none that would speak one word. Then Sir Kay took the shield in his\r\nhands. Sir knight, said the damosel, what is your name? Wit ye well,\r\nsaid he, my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal, that wide-where is known.\r\nSir, said that damosel, lay down that shield, for wit ye well it\r\nfalleth not for you, for he must be a better knight than ye that shall\r\nwield this shield. Damosel, said Sir Kay, wit ye well I took this\r\nshield in my hands by your leave for to behold it, not to that intent;\r\nbut go wheresomever thou wilt, for I will not go with you.\r\n\r\nThen the damosel stood still a great while and beheld many of those\r\nknights. Then spake the knight, La Cote Male Taile: Fair damosel, I\r\nwill take the shield and that adventure upon me, so I wist I should\r\nknow whitherward my journey might be; for because I was this day made\r\nknight I would take this adventure upon me. What is your name, fair\r\nyoung man? said the damosel. My name is, said he, La Cote Male Taile.\r\nWell mayest thou be called so, said the damosel, the knight with the\r\nevil-shapen coat; but an thou be so hardy to take upon thee to bear\r\nthat shield and to follow me, wit thou well thy skin shall be as well\r\nhewn as thy coat. As for that, said La Cote Male Taile, when I am so\r\nhewn I will ask you no salve to heal me withal. And forthwithal there\r\ncame into the court two squires and brought him great horses, and his\r\narmour, and his spears, and anon he was armed and took his leave. I\r\nwould not by my will, said the king, that ye took upon you that hard\r\nadventure. Sir, said he, this adventure is mine, and the first that\r\never I took upon me, and that will I follow whatsomever come of me.\r\nThen that damosel departed, and La Cote Male Taile fast followed after.\r\nAnd within a while he overtook the damosel, and anon she missaid him in\r\nthe foulest manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. How La Cote Male Taile overthrew Sir Dagonet the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfool, and of the rebuke that he had of the damosel.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Kay ordained Sir Dagonet, King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s fool, to follow after\r\nLa Cote Male Taile; and there Sir Kay ordained that Sir Dagonet was\r\nhorsed and armed, and bade him follow La Cote Male Taile and proffer\r\nhim to joust, and so he did; and when he saw La Cote Male Taile, he\r\ncried and bade him make him ready to joust. So Sir La Cote Male Taile\r\nsmote Sir Dagonet over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s croup. Then the damosel mocked La\r\nCote Male Taile, and said: Fie for shame! now art thou shamed in\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, when they send a fool to have ado with thee, and\r\nspecially at thy first jousts; thus she rode long, and chid. And within\r\na while there came Sir Bleoberis, the good knight, and there he jousted\r\nwith La Cote Male Taile, and there Sir Bleoberis smote him so sore,\r\nthat horse and all fell to the earth. Then La Cote Male Taile arose up\r\nlightly, and dressed his shield, and drew his sword, and would have\r\ndone battle to the utterance, for he was wood wroth. Not so, said Sir\r\nBleoberis de Ganis, as at this time I will not fight upon foot. Then\r\nthe damosel Maledisant rebuked him in the foulest manner, and bade him:\r\nTurn again, coward. Ah, damosel, he said, I pray you of mercy to missay\r\nme no more, my grief is enough though ye give me no more; I call myself\r\nnever the worse knight when a mare\xe2\x80\x99s son faileth me, and also I count\r\nme never the worse knight for a fall of Sir Bleoberis.\r\n\r\nSo thus he rode with her two days; and by fortune there came Sir\r\nPalomides and encountered with him, and he in the same wise served him\r\nas did Bleoberis to-forehand. What dost thou here in my fellowship?\r\nsaid the damosel Maledisant, thou canst not sit no knight, nor\r\nwithstand him one buffet, but if it were Sir Dagonet. Ah, fair damosel,\r\nI am not the worse to take a fall of Sir Palomides, and yet great\r\ndisworship have I none, for neither Bleoberis nor yet Palomides would\r\nnot fight with me on foot. As for that, said the damosel, wit thou well\r\nthey have disdain and scorn to light off their horses to fight with\r\nsuch a lewd knight as thou art. So in the meanwhile there came Sir\r\nMordred, Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and so he fell in the fellowship with\r\nthe damosel Maledisant. And then they came afore the Castle Orgulous,\r\nand there was such a custom that there might no knight come by that\r\ncastle but either he must joust or be prisoner, or at the least to lose\r\nhis horse and his harness. And there came out two knights against them,\r\nand Sir Mordred jousted with the foremost, and that knight of the\r\ncastle smote Sir Mordred down off his horse. And then La Cote Male\r\nTaile jousted with that other, and either of them smote other down,\r\nhorse and all, to the earth. And when they avoided their horses, then\r\neither of them took other\xe2\x80\x99s horses. And then La Cote Male Taile rode\r\nunto that knight that smote down Sir Mordred, and jousted with him. And\r\nthere Sir La Cote Male Taile hurt and wounded him passing sore, and put\r\nhim from his horse as he had been dead. So he turned unto him that met\r\nhim afore, and he took the flight towards the castle, and Sir La Cote\r\nMale Taile rode after him into the Castle Orgulous, and there La Cote\r\nMale Taile slew him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How La Cote Male Taile fought against an hundred knights,\r\nand how he escaped by the mean of a lady.\r\n\r\nAnd anon there came an hundred knights about him and assailed him; and\r\nwhen he saw his horse should be slain he alighted and voided his horse,\r\nand put the bridle under his feet, and so put him out of the gate. And\r\nwhen he had so done he hurled in among them, and dressed his back unto\r\na lady\xe2\x80\x99s chamber-wall, thinking himself that he had liefer die there\r\nwith worship than to abide the rebukes of the damosel Maledisant. And\r\nin the meantime as he stood and fought, that lady whose was the chamber\r\nwent out slily at her postern, and without the gates she found La Cote\r\nMale Taile\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and lightly she gat him by the bridle, and tied him\r\nto the postern. And then she went unto her chamber slily again for to\r\nbehold how that one knight fought against an hundred knights. And when\r\nshe had beheld him long she went to a window behind his back, and said:\r\nThou knight, thou fightest wonderly well, but for all that at the last\r\nthou must needs die, but, an thou canst through thy mighty prowess, win\r\nunto yonder postern, for there have I fastened thy horse to abide thee:\r\nbut wit thou well thou must think on thy worship, and think not to die,\r\nfor thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and\r\nmightily. When La Cote Male Taile heard her say so he gripped his sword\r\nin his hands, and put his shield fair afore him, and through the\r\nthickest press he thrulled through them. And when he came to the\r\npostern he found there ready four knights, and at two the first strokes\r\nhe slew two of the knights, and the other fled; and so he won his horse\r\nand rode from them. And all as it was it was rehearsed in King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt, how he slew twelve knights within the Castle Orgulous; and so he\r\nrode on his way.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meanwhile the damosel said to Sir Mordred: I ween my foolish\r\nknight be either slain or taken prisoner: then were they ware where he\r\ncame riding. And when he was come unto them he told all how he had sped\r\nand escaped in despite of them all: And some of the best of them will\r\ntell no tales. Thou liest falsely, said the damosel, that dare I make\r\ngood, but as a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee\r\npass. That may ye prove, said La Cote Male Taile. With that she sent a\r\ncourier of hers, that rode alway with her, for to know the truth of\r\nthis deed; and so he rode thither lightly, and asked how and in what\r\nmanner that La Cote Male Taile was escaped out of the castle. Then all\r\nthe knights cursed him, and said that he was a fiend and no man: For he\r\nhath slain here twelve of our best knights, and we weened unto this day\r\nthat it had been too much for Sir Launcelot du Lake or for Sir Tristram\r\nde Liones. And in despite of us all he is departed from us and maugre\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\nWith this answer the courier departed and came to Maledisant his lady,\r\nand told her all how Sir La Cote Male Taile had sped at the Castle\r\nOrgulous. Then she smote down her head, and said little. By my head,\r\nsaid Sir Mordred to the damosel, ye are greatly to blame so to rebuke\r\nhim, for I warn you plainly he is a good knight, and I doubt not but he\r\nshall prove a noble knight; but as yet he may not yet sit sure on\r\nhorseback, for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage\r\nand exercise. But when he cometh to the strokes of his sword he is then\r\nnoble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides, for wit\r\nye well they are wily men of arms, and anon they know when they see a\r\nyoung knight by his riding, how they are sure to give him a fall from\r\nhis horse or a great buffet. But for the most part they will not light\r\non foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed. For\r\nin likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he was first made knight, he\r\nwas often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he\r\nrecovered his renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round\r\nTable. And therefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many\r\nknights causeth them that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have\r\nseen the old proved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but\r\nyoung beginners. Thus they rode sure talking by the way together.\r\n\r\nHere leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot\r\ndu Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote\r\nMale Taile, and how he followed after him, and how La Cote Male Taile\r\nwas prisoner.\r\n\r\nThat when he was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard he tell\r\nof the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he slew the lion, and how\r\nhe took upon him the adventure of the black shield, the which was named\r\nat that time the hardiest adventure of the world. So God me save, said\r\nSir Launcelot unto many of his fellows, it was shame to all the noble\r\nknights to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure upon him\r\nfor his destruction; for I will that ye wit, said Sir Launcelot, that\r\nthat damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield many a day for to seek\r\nthe most proved knights, and that was she that Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9 took\r\nthat shield from her, and after Tristram de Liones rescued that shield\r\nfrom him and gave it to the damosel again, a little afore that time\r\nthat Sir Tristram fought with my nephew Sir Blamore de Ganis, for a\r\nquarrel that was betwixt the King of Ireland and him. Then many knights\r\nwere sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone forth to that\r\nadventure. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I cast me to ride after him. And\r\nwithin seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male Taile, and then\r\nhe saluted him and the damosel Maledisant. And when Sir Mordred saw Sir\r\nLauncelot, then he left their fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode\r\nwith them all a day, and ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile;\r\nand then Sir Launcelot answered for him, then she left off, and rebuked\r\nSir Launcelot.\r\n\r\nSo this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir\r\nLauncelot, excusing him of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains; and\r\nsaid in the letter, as he was a true knight he had never ado fleshly\r\nwith Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and gentily Sir\r\nTristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching him to be his good\r\nfriend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall, and that Sir Launcelot\r\nwould excuse him if that ever he saw her. And within short time by the\r\ngrace of God, said Sir Tristram, that he would speak with La Beale\r\nIsoud, and with him right hastily. Then Sir Launcelot departed from the\r\ndamosel and from Sir La Cote Male Taile, for to oversee that letter,\r\nand to write another letter unto Sir Tristram de Liones.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel until\r\nthey came to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were six knights\r\nstood afore him, and one of them proffered to joust with La Cote Male\r\nTaile. And there La Cote Male Taile smote him over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s croup.\r\nAnd then the five knights set upon him all at once with their spears,\r\nand there they smote La Cote Male Taile down, horse and man. And then\r\nthey alighted suddenly, and set their hands upon him all at once, and\r\ntook him prisoner, and so led him unto the castle and kept him as\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nAnd on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered the damosel with\r\nletters unto Sir Tristram, and then he took his way after La Cote Male\r\nTaile; and by the way upon a bridge there was a knight proffered Sir\r\nLauncelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot smote him down, and then they\r\nfought upon foot a noble battle together, and a mighty; and at the last\r\nSir Launcelot smote him down grovelling upon his hands and his knees.\r\nAnd then that knight yielded him, and Sir Launcelot received him fair.\r\nSir, said the knight, I require thee tell me your name, for much my\r\nheart giveth unto you. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, as at this time I will\r\nnot tell you my name, unless then that ye tell me your name. Certainly,\r\nsaid the knight, my name is Sir Nerovens, that was made knight of my\r\nlord Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, Nerovens de Lile, said Sir Launcelot, I\r\nam right glad that ye are proved a good knight, for now wit ye well my\r\nname is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Nerovens de Lile, what\r\nhave I done! And therewithal flatling he fell to his feet, and would\r\nhave kissed them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him; and then either\r\nmade great joy of other. And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot that\r\nhe should not go by the Castle of Pendragon: For there is a lord, a\r\nmighty knight, and many knights with him, and this night I heard say\r\nthat they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel,\r\nand they say he is a Knight of the Round Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after with\r\nSir Brian, and how he delivered the prisoners.\r\n\r\nAh, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and him shall I\r\nrescue or else I shall lose my life therefore. And therewithal he rode\r\nfast till he came before the Castle of Pendragon; and anon therewithal\r\nthere came six knights, and all made them ready to set upon Sir\r\nLauncelot at once; then Sir Launcelot feutred his spear, and smote the\r\nforemost that he brake his back in-sunder, and three of them hit and\r\nthree failed. And then Sir Launcelot passed through them, and lightly\r\nhe turned in again, and smote another knight through the breast and\r\nthroughout the back more than an ell, and therewithal his spear brake.\r\nSo then all the remnant of the four knights drew their swords and\r\nlashed at Sir Launcelot. And at every stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so\r\nhis strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided their saddles,\r\npassing sore wounded; and forthwithal he rode hurling into that castle.\r\n\r\nAnd anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir Brian de\r\nles Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy unto King\r\nArthur, within a while he was armed and upon horseback. And then they\r\nfeutred their spears and hurled together so strongly that both their\r\nhorses rashed to the earth. And then they avoided their saddles, and\r\ndressed their shields, and drew their swords, and flang together as\r\nwood men, and there were many strokes given in a while. At the last Sir\r\nLauncelot gave to Sir Brian such a buffet that he kneeled upon his\r\nknees, and then Sir Launcelot rashed upon him, and with great force he\r\npulled off his helm; and when Sir Brian saw that he should be slain he\r\nyielded him, and put him in his mercy and in his grace. Then Sir\r\nLauncelot made him to deliver all his prisoners that he had within his\r\ncastle, and therein Sir Launcelot found of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights thirty, and\r\nforty ladies, and so he delivered them; and then he rode his way. And\r\nanon as La Cote Male Taile was delivered he gat his horse, and his\r\nharness, and his damosel Maledisant.\r\n\r\nThe meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten withal\r\nafore at the bridge, he sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot to wit how\r\nhe sped at the Castle of Pendragon. And then they within the castle\r\nmarvelled what knight he was, when Sir Brian and his knights delivered\r\nall those prisoners. Have ye no marvel, said the damosel, for the best\r\nknight in this world was here, and did this journey, and wit ye well,\r\nshe said, it was Sir Launcelot. Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so\r\nwas his lady, and all his knights, that such a man should win them. And\r\nwhen the damosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it was Sir\r\nLauncelot du Lake that had ridden with them in fellowship, and that she\r\nremembered her how she had rebuked him and called him coward, then was\r\nshe passing heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Male disant,\r\nand named her the Damosel Bienpensant.\r\n\r\nSo then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir\r\nLauncelot. And within two mile they overtook him, and saluted him, and\r\nthanked him, and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy of her evil deed\r\nand saying: For now I know the flower of all knighthood is departed\r\neven between Sir Tristram and you. For God knoweth, said the damosel,\r\nthat I have sought you my lord, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long,\r\nand now I thank God I have met with you; and once at Camelot I met with\r\nSir Tristram, and there he rescued this black shield with the white\r\nhand holding a naked sword that Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9 had taken from\r\nme. Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my name? Sir,\r\nsaid she, there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought withal at\r\nthe bridge, and she told me your name was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Blame\r\nhave she then, said Sir Launcelot, but her lord, Sir Nerovens, hath\r\ntold her. But, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, upon this covenant I will\r\nride with you, so that ye will not rebuke this knight Sir La Cote Male\r\nTaile no more; for he is a good knight, and I doubt not he shall prove\r\na noble knight, and for his sake and pity that he should not be\r\ndestroyed I followed him to succour him in this great need. Ah, Jesu\r\nthank you, said the damosel, for now I will say unto you and to him\r\nboth, I rebuked him never for no hate that I hated him, but for great\r\nlove that I had to him. For ever I supposed that he had been too young\r\nand too tender to take upon him these adventures. And therefore by my\r\nwill I would have driven him away for jealousy that I had of his life,\r\nfor it may be no young knight\xe2\x80\x99s deed that shall enchieve this adventure\r\nto the end. Pardieu, said Sir Launcelot, it is well said, and where ye\r\nare called the Damosel Maledisant I will call you the Damosel\r\nBienpensant.\r\n\r\nAnd so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of\r\nthe country of Surluse, and there they found a fair village with a\r\nstrong bridge like a fortress. And when Sir Launcelot and they were at\r\nthe bridge there stert forth afore them of gentlemen and yeomen many,\r\nthat said: Fair lords, ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress\r\nbecause of that black shield that I see one of you bear, and therefore\r\nthere shall not pass but one of you at once; therefore choose you which\r\nof you shall enter within this bridge first. Then Sir Launcelot\r\nproffered himself first to enter within this bridge. Sir, said La Cote\r\nMale Taile, I beseech you let me enter within this fortress, and if I\r\nmay speed well I will send for you, and if it happened that I be slain,\r\nthere it goeth. And if so be that I am a prisoner taken, then may ye\r\nrescue me. I am loath, said Sir Launcelot, to let you pass this\r\npassage. Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, I pray you let me put my body in\r\nthis adventure. Now go your way, said Sir Launcelot, and Jesu be your\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nSo he entered, and anon there met with him two brethren, the one hight\r\nSir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de Amours. And anon\r\nthey met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first La Cote Male Taile\r\nsmote down Plaine de Force, and after he smote down Plaine de Amours;\r\nand then they dressed them to their shields and swords, and bade La\r\nCote Male Taile alight, and so he did; and there was dashing and\r\nfoining with swords, and so they began to assail full hard La Cote Male\r\nTaile, and many great wounds they gave him upon his head, and upon his\r\nbreast, and upon his shoulders. And as he might ever among he gave sad\r\nstrokes again. And then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be\r\nof both hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he by fine force and\r\nknightly prowess gat them afore him. And then when he felt himself so\r\nwounded, then he doubled his strokes, and gave them so many wounds that\r\nhe felled them to the earth, and would have slain them had they not\r\nyielded them. And right so Sir La Cote Male Taile took the best horse\r\nthat there was of them three, and so rode forth his way to the other\r\nfortress and bridge; and there he met with the third brother whose name\r\nwas Sir Plenorius, a full noble knight, and there they jousted\r\ntogether, and either smote other down, horse and man, to the earth. And\r\nthen they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew\r\ntheir swords, and gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight\r\nwas afore on the bridge, and another while the other. And thus they\r\nfought two hours and more, and never rested. And ever Sir Launcelot and\r\nthe damosel beheld them. Alas, said the damosel, my knight fighteth\r\npassing sore and over long. Now may ye see, said Sir Launcelot, that he\r\nis a noble knight, for to consider his first battle, and his grievous\r\nwounds; and even forthwithal so wounded as he is, it is marvel that he\r\nmay endure this long battle with that good knight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after\r\nrescued by Sir Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame four brethren.\r\n\r\nThis meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the earth,\r\nwhat for-wounded and what for-bled he might not stand. Then the other\r\nknight had pity of him, and said: Fair young knight, dismay you not,\r\nfor had ye been fresh when ye met with me, as I was, I wot well that I\r\nshould not have endured so long as ye have done; and therefore for your\r\nnoble deeds of arms I shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all\r\nthat I may. And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him\r\nup in his arms, and led him into his tower. And then he commanded him\r\nthe wine, and made to search him and to stop his bleeding wounds. Sir,\r\nsaid La Cote Male Taile, withdraw you from me, and hie you to yonder\r\nbridge again, for there will meet with you another manner knight than\r\never was I. Why, said Plenorius, is there another manner knight behind\r\nof your fellowship? Yea, said La Cote Male Taile, there is a much\r\nbetter knight than I am. What is his name? said Plenorius. Ye shall not\r\nknow for me, said La Cote Male Taile. Well, said the knight, he shall\r\nbe encountered withal whatsomever he be.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said: Sir Plenorius, where\r\nart thou? either thou must deliver me the prisoner that thou hast led\r\nunto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me. Then Plenorius gat\r\nhis horse, and came with a spear in his hand walloping toward Sir\r\nLauncelot; and then they began to feutre their spears, and came\r\ntogether as thunder, and smote either other so mightily that their\r\nhorses fell down under them. And then they avoided their horses, and\r\npulled out their swords, and like two bulls they lashed together with\r\ngreat strokes and foins; but ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon\r\nhim, and Sir Plenorius traced to have gone about him. But Sir Launcelot\r\nwould not suffer that, but bare him backer and backer, till he came\r\nnigh his tower gate. And then said Sir Launcelot: I know thee well for\r\na good knight, but wit thou well thy life and death is in my hand, and\r\ntherefore yield thee to me, and thy prisoner. The other answered no\r\nword, but struck mightily upon Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s helm, that the fire\r\nsprang out of his eyes. Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes so\r\nthick, and smote at him so mightily, that he made him kneel upon his\r\nknees. And therewith Sir Launcelot leapt upon him, and pulled him\r\ngrovelling down. Then Sir Plenorius yielded him, and his tower, and all\r\nhis prisoners at his will.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Launcelot received him and took his troth; and then he rode to\r\nthe other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted with other three of\r\nhis brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the other hight Pellogris,\r\nand the third Sir Pellandris. And first upon horseback Sir Launcelot\r\nsmote them down, and afterward he beat them on foot, and made them to\r\nyield them unto him; and then he returned unto Sir Plenorius, and there\r\nhe found in his prison King Carados of Scotland, and many other\r\nknights, and all they were delivered. And then Sir La Cote Male Taile\r\ncame to Sir Launcelot, and then Sir Launcelot would have given him all\r\nthese fortresses and these bridges. Nay, said La Cote Male Taile, I\r\nwill not have Sir Plenorius\xe2\x80\x99 livelihood; with that he will grant you,\r\nmy lord Sir Launcelot, to come unto King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, and to be his\r\nknight, and all his brethren, I will pray you, my lord, to let him have\r\nhis livelihood. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, with this that he will\r\ncome to the court of King Arthur and become his man, and his brethren\r\nfive. And as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir\r\nLauncelot, at the next feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall\r\nbe Knight of the Round Table. Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of\r\nPentecost I will be at Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court, and at that time I will be\r\nguided and ruled as King Arthur and ye will have me. Then Sir Launcelot\r\nand Sir La Cote Male Taile reposed them there, unto the time that Sir\r\nLa Cote Male Taile was whole of his wounds, and there they had merry\r\ncheer, and good rest, and many good games, and there were many fair\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot made La Cote Male Taile lord of the\r\nCastle of Pendragon, and after was made knight of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nAnd in the meanwhile came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Brandiles,\r\nand anon they fellowshipped with them. And then within ten days, then\r\ndeparted those knights of Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court from these fortresses. And as\r\nSir Launcelot came by the Castle of Pendragon there he put Sir Brian de\r\nles Isles from his lands, for cause he would never be withhold with\r\nKing Arthur; and all that Castle of Pendragon and all the lands thereof\r\nhe gave to Sir La Cote Male Taile. And then Sir Launcelot sent for\r\nNerovens that he made once knight, and he made him to have all the rule\r\nof that castle and of that country, under La Cote Male Taile; and so\r\nthey rode to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court all wholly together. And at Pentecost next\r\nfollowing there was Sir Plenorius and Sir La Cote Male Taile, called\r\notherwise by right Sir Breunor le Noire, both made Knights of the Table\r\nRound; and great lands King Arthur gave them, and there Breunor le\r\nNoire wedded that damosel Maledisant. And after she was called\r\nBeauvivante, but ever after for the more part he was called La Cote\r\nMale Taile; and he proved a passing noble knight, and mighty; and many\r\nworshipful deeds he did after in his life; and Sir Plenorius proved a\r\nnoble knight and full of prowess, and all the days of their life for\r\nthe most part they awaited upon Sir Launcelot; and Sir Plenorius\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbrethren were ever knights of King Arthur. And also, as the French book\r\nmaketh mention, Sir La Cote Male Taile avenged his father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. How La Beale Isoud sent letters to Sir Tristram by her maid\r\nBragwaine, and of divers adventures of Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nNow leave we here Sir La Cote Male Taile, and turn we unto Sir Tristram\r\nde Liones that was in Brittany. When La Beale Isoud understood that he\r\nwas wedded she sent to him by her maiden Bragwaine as piteous letters\r\nas could be thought and made, and her conclusion was that, an it\r\npleased Sir Tristram, that he would come to her court, and bring with\r\nhim Isoud la Blanche Mains, and they should be kept as well as she\r\nherself. Then Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Kehydius, and asked him\r\nwhether he would go with him into Cornwall secretly. He answered him\r\nthat he was ready at all times. And then he let ordain privily a little\r\nvessel, and therein they went, Sir Tristram, Kehydius, Dame Bragwaine,\r\nand Gouvernail, Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s squire. So when they were in the sea a\r\ncontrarious wind blew them on the coasts of North Wales, nigh the\r\nCastle Perilous. Then said Sir Tristram: Here shall ye abide me these\r\nten days, and Gouvernail, my squire, with you. And if so be I come not\r\nagain by that day take the next way into Cornwall; for in this forest\r\nare many strange adventures, as I have heard say, and some of them I\r\ncast me to prove or I depart. And when I may I shall hie me after you.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram and Kehydius took their horses and departed from\r\ntheir fellowship. And so they rode within that forest a mile and more;\r\nand at the last Sir Tristram saw afore him a likely knight, armed,\r\nsitting by a well, and a strong mighty horse passing nigh him tied to\r\nan oak, and a man hoving and riding by him leading an horse laden with\r\nspears. And this knight that sat at the well seemed by his countenance\r\nto be passing heavy. Then Sir Tristram rode near him and said: Fair\r\nknight, why sit ye so drooping? ye seem to be a knight-errant by your\r\narms and harness, and therefore dress you to joust with one of us, or\r\nwith both. Therewithal that knight made no words, but took his shield\r\nand buckled it about his neck, and lightly he took his horse and leapt\r\nupon him. And then he took a great spear of his squire, and departed\r\nhis way a furlong. Sir Kehydius asked leave of Sir Tristram to joust\r\nfirst. Do your best, said Sir Tristram. So they met together, and there\r\nSir Kehydius had a fall, and was sore wounded on high above the paps.\r\nThen Sir Tristram said: Knight, that is well jousted, now make you\r\nready unto me. I am ready, said the knight. And then that knight took a\r\ngreater spear in his hand, and encountered with Sir Tristram, and there\r\nby great force that knight smote down Sir Tristram from his horse and\r\nhad a great fall. Then Sir Tristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he\r\navoided his horse, and put his shield afore his shoulder, and drew his\r\nsword. And then Sir Tristram required that knight of his knighthood to\r\nalight upon foot and fight with him. I will well, said the knight; and\r\nso he alighted upon foot, and avoided his horse, and cast his shield\r\nupon his shoulder, and drew his sword, and there they fought a long\r\nbattle together full nigh two hours. Then Sir Tristram said: Fair\r\nknight, hold thine hand, and tell me of whence thou art, and what is\r\nthy name. As for that, said the knight, I will be avised; but an thou\r\nwilt tell me thy name peradventure I will tell thee mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Tristram met with Sir Lamorak de Galis, and how\r\nthey fought, and after accorded never to fight together.\r\n\r\nNow fair knight, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Sir, said\r\nthe other knight, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. Ah, Sir Lamorak,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, well be we met, and bethink thee now of the despite\r\nthou didst me of the sending of the horn unto King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s court, to the\r\nintent to have slain or dishonoured my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud;\r\nand therefore wit thou well, said Sir Tristram, the one of us shall die\r\nor we depart. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, remember that we were together in\r\nthe Isle of Servage, and at that time ye promised me great friendship.\r\nThen Sir Tristram would make no longer delays, but lashed at Sir\r\nLamorak; and thus they fought long till either were weary of other.\r\nThen Sir Tristram said to Sir Lamorak: In all my life met I never with\r\nsuch a knight that was so big and well breathed as ye be, therefore,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, it were pity that any of us both should here be\r\nmischieved. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, for your renown and name I will that\r\nye have the worship of this battle, and therefore I will yield me unto\r\nyou. And therewith he took the point of his sword to yield him. Nay,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, ye shall not do so, for well I know your proffers,\r\nand more of your gentleness than for any fear or dread ye have of me.\r\nAnd therewithal Sir Tristram proffered him his sword and said: Sir\r\nLamorak, as an overcome knight I yield me unto you as to a man of the\r\nmost noble prowess that ever I met withal. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I\r\nwill do you gentleness; I require you let us be sworn together that\r\nnever none of us shall after this day have ado with other. And\r\ntherewithal Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak sware that never none of them\r\nshould fight against other, nor for weal nor for woe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Palomides followed the Questing Beast, and smote\r\ndown Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak with one spear.\r\n\r\nAnd this meanwhile there came Sir Palomides, the good knight, following\r\nthe Questing Beast that had in shape a head like a serpent\xe2\x80\x99s head, and\r\na body like a leopard, buttocks like a lion, and footed like an hart;\r\nand in his body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of\r\nthirty couple of hounds questing, and such a noise that beast made\r\nwheresomever he went; and this beast ever more Sir Palomides followed,\r\nfor it was called his quest. And right so as he followed this beast it\r\ncame by Sir Tristram, and soon after came Palomides. And to brief this\r\nmatter he smote down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak both with one spear;\r\nand so he departed after the beast Galtisant, that was called the\r\nQuesting Beast; wherefore these two knights were passing wroth that Sir\r\nPalomides would not fight on foot with them. Here men may understand\r\nthat be of worship, that he was never formed that all times might\r\nstand, but sometime he was put to the worse by mal-fortune; and at\r\nsometime the worse knight put the better knight to a rebuke.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak gat Sir Kehydius upon a shield\r\nbetwixt them both, and led him to a forester\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, and there they\r\ngave him in charge to keep him well, and with him they abode three\r\ndays. Then the two knights took their horses and at the cross they\r\ndeparted. And then said Sir Tristram to Sir Lamorak: I require you if\r\nye hap to meet with Sir Palomides, say him that he shall find me at the\r\nsame well where I met him, and there I, Sir Tristram, shall prove\r\nwhether he be better knight than I. And so either departed from other a\r\nsundry way, and Sir Tristram rode nigh thereas was Sir Kehydius; and\r\nSir Lamorak rode until he came to a chapel, and there he put his horse\r\nunto pasture. And anon there came Sir Meliagaunce, that was King\r\nBagdemagus\xe2\x80\x99 son, and he there put his horse to pasture, and was not\r\nware of Sir Lamorak; and then this knight Sir Meliagaunce made his moan\r\nof the love that he had to Queen Guenever, and there he made a woful\r\ncomplaint. All this heard Sir Lamorak, and on the morn Sir Lamorak took\r\nhis horse and rode unto the forest, and there he met with two knights\r\nhoving under the wood-shaw. Fair knights, said Sir Lamorak, what do ye\r\nhoving here and watching? and if ye be knights-errant that will joust,\r\nlo I am ready. Nay, sir knight, they said, not so, we abide not here to\r\njoust with you, but we lie here in await of a knight that slew our\r\nbrother. What knight was that, said Sir Lamorak, that you would fain\r\nmeet withal? Sir, they said, it is Sir Launcelot that slew our brother,\r\nand if ever we may meet with him he shall not escape, but we shall slay\r\nhim. Ye take upon you a great charge, said Sir Lamorak, for Sir\r\nLauncelot is a noble proved knight. As for that we doubt not, for there\r\nnis none of us but we are good enough for him. I will not believe that,\r\nsaid Sir Lamorak, for I heard never yet of no knight the days of my\r\nlife but Sir Launcelot was too big for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought\r\ntogether for the beauty of Dame Guenever.\r\n\r\nRight so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir\r\nLauncelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted\r\nhim, and he him again. And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir Launcelot if\r\nthere were anything that he might do for him in these marches. Nay,\r\nsaid Sir Launcelot, not at this time I thank you. Then either departed\r\nfrom other, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas he left the two knights,\r\nand then he found them hid in the leaved wood. Fie on you, said Sir\r\nLamorak, false cowards, pity and shame it is that any of you should\r\ntake the high order of knighthood. So Sir Lamorak departed from them,\r\nand within a while he met with Sir Meliagaunce. And then Sir Lamorak\r\nasked him why he loved Queen Guenever as he did: For I was not far from\r\nyou when ye made your complaint by the chapel. Did ye so? said Sir\r\nMeliagaunce, then will I abide by it: I love Queen Guenever, what will\r\nye with it? I will prove and make good that she is the fairest lady and\r\nmost of beauty in the world. As to that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay\r\nthereto, for Queen Morgawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his\r\nmother is the fairest queen and lady that beareth the life. That is not\r\nso, said Sir Meliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy\r\nbody. Will ye so? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not\r\nto fight. Then they departed either from other in great wrath. And then\r\nthey came riding together as it had been thunder, and either smote\r\nother so sore that their horses fell backward to the earth. And then\r\nthey avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their\r\nswords. And then they hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they\r\nfought a great while. For Meliagaunce was a good man and of great\r\nmight, but Sir Lamorak was hard big for him, and put him always aback,\r\nbut either had wounded other sore.\r\n\r\nAnd as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot and Sir\r\nBleoberis riding. And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt them, and asked\r\nthem for what cause they fought so together: And ye are both knights of\r\nKing Arthur!\r\n\r\nSir, said Meliagaunce, I shall tell you for what cause we do this\r\nbattle. I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the fairest\r\nlady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he said Queen\r\nMorgawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of beauty. Ah, Sir\r\nLamorak, why sayest thou so? it is not thy part to dispraise thy\r\nprincess that thou art under her obeissance, and we all. And therewith\r\nhe alighted on foot, and said: For this quarrel, make thee ready, for I\r\nwill prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and most\r\nof bounty in the world. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado\r\nwith you in this quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest;\r\nand though I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth;\r\nfor though my lady, Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye well\r\nQueen Morgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight\r\nthinketh his own lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir, ye are the man in\r\nthe world except Sir Tristram that I am most loathest to have ado\r\nwithal, but, an ye will needs fight with me I shall endure you as long\r\nas I may. Then spake Sir Bleoberis and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I\r\nwist you never so misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you\r\nbut reason and knightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh\r\nthat she is the fairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason\r\nthat ye should be wroth with me for such language? And well ye wot,\r\nthat Sir Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know, and he hath ought you\r\nand us ever good will, and therefore I pray you be good friends. Then\r\nSir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak. I pray you forgive me mine evil\r\nwill, and if I was misadvised I will amend it. Sir, said Sir Lamorak,\r\nthe amends is soon made betwixt you and me. And so Sir Launcelot and\r\nSir Bleoberis departed, and Sir Meliagaunce and Sir Lamorak took their\r\nhorses, and either departed from other.\r\n\r\nAnd within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak, and\r\njousted with him; and there he smote down Sir Lamorak, and wounded him\r\nsore with a spear, and so he rode from him; wherefore Sir Lamorak was\r\nwroth that he would not fight with him on foot, howbeit that Sir\r\nLamorak knew not King Arthur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Kay met with Sir Tristram, and after of the shame\r\nspoken of the knights of Cornwall, and how they jousted.\r\n\r\nNow leave we of this tale, and speak we of Sir Tristram, that as he\r\nrode he met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal; and there Sir Kay asked Sir\r\nTristram of what country he was. He answered that he was of the country\r\nof Cornwall. It may well be, said Sir Kay, for yet heard I never that\r\never good knight came out of Cornwall. That is evil spoken, said Sir\r\nTristram, but an it please you to tell me your name I require you. Sir,\r\nwit ye well, said Sir Kay, that my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal. Is\r\nthat your name? said Sir Tristram, now wit ye well that ye are named\r\nthe shamefullest knight of your tongue that now is living; howbeit ye\r\nare called a good knight, but ye are called unfortunate, and passing\r\noverthwart of your tongue. And thus they rode together till they came\r\nto a bridge. And there was a knight would not let them pass till one of\r\nthem jousted with him; and so that knight jousted with Sir Kay, and\r\nthere that knight gave Sir Kay a fall: his name was Sir Tor, Sir\r\nLamorak\xe2\x80\x99s half-brother. And then they two rode to their lodging, and\r\nthere they found Sir Brandiles, and Sir Tor came thither anon after.\r\nAnd as they sat at supper these four knights, three of them spake all\r\nshame by Cornish knights. Sir Tristram heard all that they said and he\r\nsaid but little, but he thought the more, but at that time he\r\ndiscovered not his name.\r\n\r\nUpon the morn Sir Tristram took his horse and abode them upon their\r\nway. And there Sir Brandiles proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and\r\nSir Tristram smote him down, horse and all, to the earth. Then Sir Tor\r\nle Fise de Vayshoure encountered with Sir Tristram and there Sir\r\nTristram smote him down, and then he rode his way, and Sir Kay followed\r\nhim, but he would not of his fellowship. Then Sir Brandiles came to Sir\r\nKay and said: I would wit fain what is that knight\xe2\x80\x99s name. Come on with\r\nme, said Sir Kay, and we shall pray him to tell us his name. So they\r\nrode together till they came nigh him, and then they were ware where he\r\nsat by a well, and had put off his helm to drink at the well. And when\r\nhe saw them come he laced on his helm lightly, and took his horse, and\r\nproffered them to joust. Nay, said Sir Brandiles, we jousted late\r\nenough with you, we come not in that intent. But for this we come to\r\nrequire you of knighthood to tell us your name. My fair knights, sithen\r\nthat is your desire, and to please you, ye shall wit that my name is\r\nSir Tristram de Liones, nephew unto King Mark of Cornwall. In good\r\ntime, said Sir Brandiles, and well be ye found, and wit ye well that we\r\nbe right glad that we have found you, and we be of a fellowship that\r\nwould be right glad of your company. For ye are the knight in the world\r\nthat the noble fellowship of the Round Table most desireth to have the\r\ncompany of. God thank them, said Sir Tristram, of their great goodness,\r\nbut as yet I feel well that I am unable to be of their fellowship, for\r\nI was never yet of such deeds of worthiness to be in the company of\r\nsuch a fellowship. Ah, said Sir Kay, an ye be Sir Tristram de Liones,\r\nye are the man called now most of prowess except Sir Launcelot du Lake;\r\nfor he beareth not the life, Christian nor heathen, that can find such\r\nanother knight, to speak of his prowess, and of his hands, and his\r\ntruth withal. For yet could there never creature say of him dishonour\r\nand make it good. Thus they talked a great while, and then they\r\ndeparted either from other such ways as them seemed best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. How King Arthur was brought into the Forest Perilous, and\r\nhow Sir Tristram saved his life.\r\n\r\nNow shall ye hear what was the cause that King Arthur came into the\r\nForest Perilous, that was in North Wales, by the means of a lady. Her\r\nname was Annowre, and this lady came to King Arthur at Cardiff; and she\r\nby fair promise and fair behests made King Arthur to ride with her into\r\nthat Forest Perilous; and she was a great sorceress; and many days she\r\nhad loved King Arthur, and because she would have him to lie by her she\r\ncame into that country. So when the king was gone with her many of his\r\nknights followed after King Arthur when they missed him, as Sir\r\nLauncelot, Brandiles, and many other; and when she had brought him to\r\nher tower she desired him to lie by her; and then the king remembered\r\nhim of his lady, and would not lie by her for no craft that she could\r\ndo. Then every day she would make him ride into that forest with his\r\nown knights, to the intent to have had King Arthur slain. For when this\r\nLady Annowre saw that she might not have him at her will, then she\r\nlaboured by false means to have destroyed King Arthur, and slain.\r\n\r\nThen the Lady of the Lake that was alway friendly to King Arthur, she\r\nunderstood by her subtle crafts that King Arthur was like to be\r\ndestroyed. And therefore this Lady of the Lake, that hight Nimue, came\r\ninto that forest to seek after Sir Launcelot du Lake or Sir Tristram\r\nfor to help King Arthur; foras that same day this Lady of the Lake knew\r\nwell that King Arthur should be slain, unless that he had help of one\r\nof these two knights. And thus she rode up and down till she met with\r\nSir Tristram, and anon as she saw him she knew him. O my lord Sir\r\nTristram, she said, well be ye met, and blessed be the time that I have\r\nmet with you; for this same day, and within these two hours, shall be\r\ndone the foulest deed that ever was done in this land. O fair damosel,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, may I amend it. Come on with me, she said, and that\r\nin all the haste ye may, for ye shall see the most worshipfullest\r\nknight of the world hard bestead. Then said Sir Tristram: I am ready to\r\nhelp such a noble man. He is neither better nor worse, said the Lady of\r\nthe Lake, but the noble King Arthur himself. God defend, said Sir\r\nTristram, that ever he should be in such distress. Then they rode\r\ntogether a great pace, until they came to a little turret or castle;\r\nand underneath that castle they saw a knight standing upon foot\r\nfighting with two knights; and so Sir Tristram beheld them, and at the\r\nlast the two knights smote down the one knight, and that one of them\r\nunlaced his helm to have slain him. And the Lady Annowre gat King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s sword in her hand to have stricken off his head. And\r\ntherewithal came Sir Tristram with all his might, crying: Traitress,\r\ntraitress, leave that. And anon there Sir Tristram smote the one of the\r\nknights through the body that he fell dead; and then he rashed to the\r\nother and smote his back asunder; and in the meanwhile the Lady of the\r\nLake cried to King Arthur: Let not that false lady escape. Then King\r\nArthur overtook her, and with the same sword he smote off her head, and\r\nthe Lady of the Lake took up her head and hung it up by the hair of her\r\nsaddle-bow. And then Sir Tristram horsed King Arthur and rode forth\r\nwith him, but he charged the Lady of the Lake not to discover his name\r\nas at that time.\r\n\r\nWhen the king was horsed he thanked heartily Sir Tristram, and desired\r\nto wit his name; but he would not tell him, but that he was a poor\r\nknight adventurous; and so he bare King Arthur fellowship till he met\r\nwith some of his knights. And within a while he met with Sir Ector de\r\nMaris, and he knew not King Arthur nor Sir Tristram, and he desired to\r\njoust with one of them. Then Sir Tristram rode unto Sir Ector, and\r\nsmote him from his horse. And when he had done so he came again to the\r\nking and said: My lord, yonder is one of your knights, he may bare you\r\nfellowship, and another day that deed that I have done for you I trust\r\nto God ye shall understand that I would do you service. Alas, said King\r\nArthur, let me wit what ye are? Not at this time, said Sir Tristram. So\r\nhe departed and left King Arthur and Sir Ector together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Tristram came to La Beale Isoud, and how Kehydius\r\nbegan to love Beale Isoud, and of a letter that Tristram found.\r\n\r\nAnd then at a day set Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak met at the well; and\r\nthen they took Kehydius at the forester\xe2\x80\x99s house, and so they rode with\r\nhim to the ship where they left Dame Bragwaine and Gouvernail, and so\r\nthey sailed into Cornwall all wholly together. And by assent and\r\ninformation of Dame Bragwaine when they were landed they rode unto Sir\r\nDinas, the Seneschal, a trusty friend of Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s. And so Dame\r\nBragwaine and Sir Dinas rode to the court of King Mark, and told the\r\nqueen, La Beale Isoud, that Sir Tristram was nigh her in that country.\r\nThen for very pure joy La Beale Isoud swooned; and when she might speak\r\nshe said: Gentle knight Seneschal, help that I might speak with him,\r\nouther my heart will brast. Then Sir Dinas and Dame Bragwaine brought\r\nSir Tristram and Kehydius privily unto the court, unto a chamber\r\nwhereas La Beale Isoud had assigned it; and to tell the joys that were\r\nbetwixt La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram, there is no tongue can tell\r\nit, nor heart think it, nor pen write it. And as the French book maketh\r\nmention, at the first time that ever Sir Kehydius saw La Beale Isoud he\r\nwas so enamoured upon her that for very pure love he might never\r\nwithdraw it. And at the last, as ye shall hear or the book be ended,\r\nSir Kehydius died for the love of La Beale Isoud. And then privily he\r\nwrote unto her letters and ballads of the most goodliest that were used\r\nin those days. And when La Beale Isoud understood his letters she had\r\npity of his complaint, and unavised she wrote another letter to comfort\r\nhim withal.\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Tristram was all this while in a turret at the commandment of\r\nLa Beale Isoud, and when she might she came unto Sir Tristram. So on a\r\nday King Mark played at the chess under a chamber window; and at that\r\ntime Sir Tristram and Sir Kehydius were within the chamber over King\r\nMark, and as it mishapped Sir Tristram found the letter that Kehydius\r\nsent unto La Beale Isoud, also he had found the letter that she wrote\r\nunto Kehydius, and at that same time La Beale Isoud was in the same\r\nchamber. Then Sir Tristram came unto La Beale Isoud and said: Madam,\r\nhere is a letter that was sent unto you, and here is the letter that ye\r\nsent unto him that sent you that letter. Alas, Madam, the good love\r\nthat I have loved you; and many lands and riches have I forsaken for\r\nyour love, and now ye are a traitress to me, the which doth me great\r\npain. But as for thee, Sir Kehydius, I brought thee out of Brittany\r\ninto this country, and thy father, King Howel, I won his lands, howbeit\r\nI wedded thy sister Isoud la Blanche Mains for the goodness she did\r\nunto me. And yet, as I am true knight, she is a clean maiden for me;\r\nbut wit thou well, Sir Kehydius, for this falsehood and treason thou\r\nhast done me, I will revenge it upon thee. And therewithal Sir Tristram\r\ndrew out his sword and said: Sir Kehydius, keep thee, and then La Beale\r\nIsoud swooned to the earth. And when Sir Kehydius saw Sir Tristram come\r\nupon him he saw none other boot, but leapt out at a bay-window even\r\nover the head where sat King Mark playing at the chess. And when the\r\nking saw one come hurling over his head he said: Fellow, what art thou,\r\nand what is the cause thou leapest out at that window? My lord the\r\nking, said Kehydius, it fortuned me that I was asleep in the window\r\nabove your head, and as I slept I slumbered, and so I fell down. And\r\nthus Sir Kehydius excused him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram departed from Tintagil, and how he\r\nsorrowed and was so long in a forest till he was out of his mind.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram dread sore lest he were discovered unto the king that\r\nhe was there; wherefore he drew him to the strength of the Tower, and\r\narmed him in such armour as he had for to fight with them that would\r\nwithstand him. And so when Sir Tristram saw there was no resistance\r\nagainst him he sent Gouvernail for his horse and his spear, and\r\nknightly he rode forth out of the castle openly, that was called the\r\nCastle of Tintagil. And even at gate he met with Gingalin, Sir\r\nGawaine\xe2\x80\x99s son. And anon Sir Gingalin put his spear in his rest, and ran\r\nupon Sir Tristram and brake his spear; and Sir Tristram at that time\r\nhad but a sword, and gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell\r\ndown from his saddle, and his sword slid adown, and carved asunder his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s neck. And so Sir Tristram rode his way into the forest, and all\r\nthis doing saw King Mark. And then he sent a squire unto the hurt\r\nknight, and commanded him to come to him, and so he did. And when King\r\nMark wist that it was Sir Gingalin he welcomed him and gave him an\r\nhorse, and asked him what knight it was that had encountered with him.\r\nSir, said Gingalin, I wot not what knight he was, but well I wot that\r\nhe sigheth and maketh great dole.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram within a while met with a knight of his own, that\r\nhight Sir Fergus. And when he had met with him he made great sorrow,\r\ninsomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow\r\nhe was in three days and three nights. Then at the last Sir Tristram\r\nsent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for to spere what tidings. And so as\r\nhe rode by the way he met with a damosel that came from Sir Palomides,\r\nto know and seek how Sir Tristram did. Then Sir Fergus told her how he\r\nwas almost out of his mind. Alas, said the damosel, where shall I find\r\nhim? In such a place, said Sir Fergus. Then Sir Fergus found Queen\r\nIsoud sick in her bed, making the greatest dole that ever any earthly\r\nwoman made. And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she made great dole\r\nbecause she might not amend him, for the more she made of him the more\r\nwas his pain. And at the last Sir Tristram took his horse and rode away\r\nfrom her. And then was it three days or that she could find him, and\r\nthen she brought him meat and drink, but he would none; and then\r\nanother time Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and it happed\r\nhim to ride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram did\r\nbattle when La Beale Isoud departed them. And there by fortune the\r\ndamosel met with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest dole that ever\r\nearthly creature made; and she yede to the lady of that castle and told\r\nher of the misadventure of Sir Tristram. Alas, said the lady of that\r\ncastle, where is my lord, Sir Tristram? Right here by your castle, said\r\nthe damosel. In good time, said the lady, is he so nigh me; he shall\r\nhave meat and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his whereupon he\r\ntaught me, for of goodly harping he beareth the prize in the world. So\r\nthis lady and damosel brought him meat and drink, but he ate little\r\nthereof. Then upon a night he put his horse from him, and then he\r\nunlaced his armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness,\r\nand brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he found the\r\nharp that the lady sent him, then would he harp, and play thereupon and\r\nweep together. And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the\r\nlady wist not where he was, then would she sit her down and play upon\r\nthat harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken\r\nthereto, and sometime he would harp himself. Thus he there endured a\r\nquarter of a year. Then at the last he ran his way, and she wist not\r\nwhere he was become. And then was he naked and waxed lean and poor of\r\nflesh; and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds, and\r\ndaily they would give him some of their meat and drink. And when he did\r\nany shrewd deed they would beat him with rods, and so they clipped him\r\nwith shears and made him like a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Tristram soused Dagonet in a well, and how\r\nPalomides sent a damosel to seek Tristram, and how Palomides met with\r\nKing Mark.\r\n\r\nAnd upon a day Dagonet, King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s fool, came into Cornwall with two\r\nsquires with him; and as they rode through that forest they came by a\r\nfair well where Sir Tristram was wont to be; and the weather was hot,\r\nand they alighted to drink of that well, and in the meanwhile their\r\nhorses brake loose. Right so Sir Tristram came unto them, and first he\r\nsoused Sir Dagonet in that well, and after his squires, and thereat\r\nlaughed the shepherds; and forthwithal he ran after their horses and\r\nbrought them again one by one, and right so, wet as they were, he made\r\nthem leap up and ride their ways. Thus Sir Tristram endured there an\r\nhalf year naked, and would never come in town nor village. The\r\nmeanwhile the damosel that Sir Palomides sent to seek Sir Tristram, she\r\nyede unto Sir Palomides and told him all the mischief that Sir Tristram\r\nendured. Alas, said Sir Palomides, it is great pity that ever so noble\r\na knight should be so mischieved for the love of a lady; but\r\nnevertheless, I will go and seek him, and comfort him an I may. Then a\r\nlittle before that time La Beale Isoud had commanded Sir Kehydius out\r\nof the country of Cornwall. So Sir Kehydius departed with a dolorous\r\nheart, and by adventure he met with Sir Palomides, and they\r\nenfellowshipped together; and either complained to other of their hot\r\nlove that they loved La Beale Isoud. Now let us, said Sir Palomides,\r\nseek Sir Tristram, that loved her as well as we, and let us prove\r\nwhether we may recover him. So they rode into that forest, and three\r\ndays and three nights they would never take their lodging, but ever\r\nsought Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nAnd upon a time, by adventure, they met with King Mark that was ridden\r\nfrom his men all alone. When they saw him Sir Palomides knew him, but\r\nSir Kehydius knew him not. Ah, false king, said Sir Palomides, it is\r\npity thou hast thy life, for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful\r\nknights, and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroyed that\r\nmost noble knight, Sir Tristram de Liones. And therefore defend thee,\r\nsaid Sir Palomides, for thou shalt die this day. That were shame, said\r\nKing Mark, for ye two are armed and I am unarmed. As for that, said Sir\r\nPalomides, I shall find a remedy therefore; here is a knight with me,\r\nand thou shalt have his harness. Nay, said King Mark, I will not have\r\nado with you, for cause have ye none to me; for all the misease that\r\nSir Tristram hath was for a letter that he found; for as to me I did to\r\nhim no displeasure, and God knoweth I am full sorry for his disease and\r\nmalady. So when the king had thus excused him they were friends, and\r\nKing Mark would have had them unto Tintagil; but Sir Palomides would\r\nnot, but turned unto the realm of Logris, and Sir Kehydius said that he\r\nwould go into Brittany.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Dagonet again, that when he and his squires were\r\nupon horseback he deemed that the shepherds had sent that fool to array\r\nthem so, because that they laughed at them, and so they rode unto the\r\nkeepers of beasts and all to-beat them. Sir Tristram saw them beat that\r\nwere wont to give him meat and drink, then he ran thither and gat Sir\r\nDagonet by the head, and gave him such a fall to the earth that he\r\nbruised him sore so that he lay still. And then he wrast his sword out\r\nof his hand, and therewith he ran to one of his squires and smote off\r\nhis head, and the other fled. And so Sir Tristram took his way with\r\nthat sword in his hand, running as he had been wild wood. Then Sir\r\nDagonet rode to King Mark and told him how he had sped in that forest.\r\nAnd therefore, said Sir Dagonet, beware, King Mark, that thou come not\r\nabout that well in the forest, for there is a fool naked, and that fool\r\nand I fool met together, and he had almost slain me. Ah, said King\r\nMark, that is Sir Matto le Breune, that fell out of his wit because he\r\nlost his lady; for when Sir Gaheris smote down Sir Matto and won his\r\nlady of him, never since was he in his mind, and that was pity, for he\r\nwas a good knight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How it was noised how Sir Tristram was dead, and how La\r\nBeale Isoud would have slain herself.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Andred, that was cousin unto Sir Tristram, made a lady that\r\nwas his paramour to say and to noise it that she was with Sir Tristram\r\nor ever he died. And this tale she brought unto King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s court, that\r\nshe buried him by a well, and that or he died he besought King Mark to\r\nmake his cousin, Sir Andred, king of the country of Liones, of the\r\nwhich Sir Tristram was lord of. All this did Sir Andred because he\r\nwould have had Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s lands. And when King Mark heard tell that\r\nSir Tristram was dead he wept and made great dole. But when Queen Isoud\r\nheard of these tidings she made such sorrow that she was nigh out of\r\nher mind; and so upon a day she thought to slay herself and never to\r\nlive after Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s death. And so upon a day La Beale Isoud gat a\r\nsword privily and bare it to her garden, and there she pight the sword\r\nthrough a plum tree up to the hilt, so that it stuck fast, and it stood\r\nbreast high. And as she would have run upon the sword and to have slain\r\nherself all this espied King Mark, how she kneeled down and said: Sweet\r\nLord Jesu, have mercy upon me, for I may not live after the death of\r\nSir Tristram de Liones, for he was my first love and he shall be the\r\nlast. And with these words came King Mark and took her in his arms, and\r\nthen he took up the sword, and bare her away with him into a tower; and\r\nthere he made her to be kept, and watched her surely, and after that\r\nshe lay long sick, nigh at the point of death.\r\n\r\nThis meanwhile ran Sir Tristram naked in the forest with the sword in\r\nhis hand, and so he came to an hermitage, and there he laid him down\r\nand slept; and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his sword, and\r\nlaid meat down by him. Thus was he kept there ten days; and at the last\r\nhe departed and came to the herdmen again. And there was a giant in\r\nthat country that hight Tauleas, and for fear of Sir Tristram more than\r\nseven year he durst never much go at large, but for the most part he\r\nkept him in a sure castle of his own; and so this Tauleas heard tell\r\nthat Sir Tristram was dead, by the noise of the court of King Mark.\r\nThen this Tauleas went daily at large. And so he happed upon a day he\r\ncame to the herdmen wandering and langering, and there he set him down\r\nto rest among them. The meanwhile there came a knight of Cornwall that\r\nled a lady with him, and his name was Sir Dinant; and when the giant\r\nsaw him he went from the herdmen and hid him under a tree, and so the\r\nknight came to that well, and there he alighted to repose him. And as\r\nsoon as he was from his horse this giant Tauleas came betwixt this\r\nknight and his horse, and took the horse and leapt upon him. So\r\nforthwith he rode unto Sir Dinant and took him by the collar, and\r\npulled him afore him upon his horse, and there would have stricken off\r\nhis head. Then the herdmen said unto Sir Tristram: Help yonder knight.\r\nHelp ye him, said Sir Tristram. We dare not, said the herdmen. Then Sir\r\nTristram was ware of the sword of the knight thereas it lay; and so\r\nthither he ran and took up the sword and struck off Sir Tauleas\xe2\x80\x99 head,\r\nand so he yede his way to the herdmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. How King Mark found Sir Tristram naked, and made him to be\r\nborne home to Tintagil, and how he was there known by a brachet.\r\n\r\nThen the knight took up the giant\xe2\x80\x99s head and bare it with him unto King\r\nMark, and told him what adventure betid him in the forest, and how a\r\nnaked man rescued him from the grimly giant, Tauleas. Where had ye this\r\nadventure? said King Mark. Forsooth, said Sir Dinant, at the fair\r\nfountain in your forest where many adventurous knights meet, and there\r\nis the mad man. Well, said King Mark, I will see that wild man. So\r\nwithin a day or two King Mark commanded his knights and his hunters\r\nthat they should be ready on the morn for to hunt, and so upon the morn\r\nhe went unto that forest. And when the king came to that well he found\r\nthere lying by that well a fair naked man, and a sword by him. Then\r\nKing Mark blew and straked, and therewith his knights came to him; and\r\nthen the king commanded his knights to: Take that naked man with\r\nfairness, and bring him to my castle. So they did softly and fair, and\r\ncast mantles upon Sir Tristram, and so led him unto Tintagil; and there\r\nthey bathed him, and washed him, and gave him hot suppings till they\r\nhad brought him well to his remembrance; but all this while there was\r\nno creature that knew Sir Tristram, nor what man he was.\r\n\r\nSo it fell upon a day that the queen, La Beale Isoud, heard of such a\r\nman, that ran naked in the forest, and how the king had brought him\r\nhome to the court. Then La Beale Isoud called unto her Dame Bragwaine\r\nand said: Come on with me, for we will go see this man that my lord\r\nbrought from the forest the last day. So they passed forth, and spered\r\nwhere was the sick man. And then a squire told the queen that he was in\r\nthe garden taking his rest, and reposing him against the sun. So when\r\nthe queen looked upon Sir Tristram she was not remembered of him. But\r\never she said unto Dame Bragwaine: Meseemeth I should have seen him\r\nheretofore in many places. But as soon as Sir Tristram saw her he knew\r\nher well enough. And then he turned away his visage and wept.\r\n\r\nThen the queen had always a little brachet with her that Sir Tristram\r\ngave her the first time that ever she came into Cornwall, and never\r\nwould that brachet depart from her but if Sir Tristram was nigh thereas\r\nwas La Beale Isoud; and this brachet was sent from the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nof France unto Sir Tristram for great love. And anon as this little\r\nbrachet felt a savour of Sir Tristram, she leapt upon him and licked\r\nhis lears and his ears, and then she whined and quested, and she\r\nsmelled at his feet and at his hands, and on all parts of his body that\r\nshe might come to. Ah, my lady, said Dame Bragwaine unto La Beale\r\nIsoud, alas, alas, said she, I see it is mine own lord, Sir Tristram.\r\nAnd thereupon Isoud fell down in a swoon, and so lay a great while. And\r\nwhen she might speak she said: My lord Sir Tristram, blessed be God ye\r\nhave your life, and now I am sure ye shall be discovered by this little\r\nbrachet, for she will never leave you. And also I am sure as soon as my\r\nlord, King Mark, do know you he will banish you out of the country of\r\nCornwall, or else he will destroy you; for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, mine own lord,\r\ngrant King Mark his will, and then draw you unto the court of King\r\nArthur, for there are ye beloved, and ever when I may I shall send unto\r\nyou; and when ye list ye may come to me, and at all times early and\r\nlate I will be at your commandment, to live as poor a life as ever did\r\nqueen or lady. O Madam, said Sir Tristram, go from me, for mickle anger\r\nand danger have I escaped for your love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. How King Mark, by the advice of his council, banished Sir\r\nTristram out of Cornwall the term of ten years.\r\n\r\nThen the queen departed, but the brachet would not from him; and\r\ntherewithal came King Mark, and the brachet set upon him, and bayed at\r\nthem all. There withal Sir Andred spake and said: Sir, this is Sir\r\nTristram, I see by the brachet. Nay, said the king, I cannot suppose\r\nthat. Then the king asked him upon his faith what he was, and what was\r\nhis name. So God me help, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones;\r\nnow do by me what ye list. Ah, said King Mark, me repenteth of your\r\nrecovery. And then he let call his barons to judge Sir Tristram to the\r\ndeath. Then many of his barons would not assent thereto, and in\r\nespecial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Fergus. And so by the advice\r\nof them all Sir Tristram was banished out of the country for ten year,\r\nand thereupon he took his oath upon a book before the king and his\r\nbarons. And so he was made to depart out of the country of Cornwall;\r\nand there were many barons brought him unto his ship, of the which some\r\nwere his friends and some his foes. And in the meanwhile there came a\r\nknight of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, his name was Dinadan, and his coming was for\r\nto seek after Sir Tristram; then they showed him where he was armed at\r\nall points going to the ship. Now fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, or ye\r\npass this court that ye will joust with me I require thee. With a good\r\nwill, said Sir Tristram, an these lords will give me leave. Then the\r\nbarons granted thereto, and so they ran together, and there Sir\r\nTristram gave Sir Dinadan a fall. And then he prayed Sir Tristram to\r\ngive him leave to go in his fellowship. Ye shall be right welcome, said\r\nthen Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nAnd so they took their horses and rode to their ships together, and\r\nwhen Sir Tristram was in the sea he said: Greet well King Mark and all\r\nmine enemies, and say them I will come again when I may; and well am I\r\nrewarded for the fighting with Sir Marhaus, and delivered all this\r\ncountry from servage; and well am I rewarded for the fetching and costs\r\nof Queen Isoud out of Ireland, and the danger that I was in first and\r\nlast, and by the way coming home what danger I had to bring again Queen\r\nIsoud from the Castle Pluere; and well am I rewarded when I fought with\r\nSir Bleoberis for Sir Segwarides\xe2\x80\x99 wife; and well am I rewarded when I\r\nfought with Sir Blamore de Ganis for King Anguish, father unto La Beale\r\nIsoud; and well am I rewarded when I smote down the good knight, Sir\r\nLamorak de Galis, at King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s request; and well am I rewarded when I\r\nfought with the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of\r\nNorthgalis, and both these would have put his land in servage, and by\r\nme they were put to a rebuke; and well am I rewarded for the slaying of\r\nTauleas, the mighty giant, and many other deeds have I done for him,\r\nand now have I my warison. And tell King Mark that many noble knights\r\nof the Table Round have spared the barons of this country for my sake.\r\nAlso am I not well rewarded when I fought with the good knight Sir\r\nPalomides and rescued Queen Isoud from him; and at that time King Mark\r\nsaid afore all his barons I should have been better rewarded. And\r\nforthwithal he took the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. How a damosel sought help to help Sir Launcelot against\r\nthirty knights, and how Sir Tristram fought with them.\r\n\r\nAnd at the next landing, fast by the sea, there met with Sir Tristram\r\nand with Sir Dinadan, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Bors de Ganis; and\r\nthere Sir Ector jousted with Sir Dinadan, and he smote him and his\r\nhorse down. And then Sir Tristram would have jousted with Sir Bors, and\r\nSir Bors said that he would not joust with no Cornish knights, for they\r\nare not called men of worship; and all this was done upon a bridge. And\r\nwith this came Sir Bleoberis and Sir Driant, and Sir Bleoberis\r\nproffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and there Sir Tristram smote down\r\nSir Bleoberis. Then said Sir Bors de Ganis: I wist never Cornish knight\r\nof so great valour nor so valiant as that knight that beareth the\r\ntrappings embroidered with crowns. And then Sir Tristram and Sir\r\nDinadan departed from them into a forest, and there met them a damosel\r\nthat came for the love of Sir Launcelot to seek after some noble\r\nknights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s court for to rescue Sir Launcelot. And so Sir\r\nLauncelot was ordained, for-by the treason of Queen Morgan le Fay to\r\nhave slain Sir Launcelot, and for that cause she ordained thirty\r\nknights to lie in await for Sir Launcelot, and this damosel knew this\r\ntreason. And for this cause the damosel came for to seek noble knights\r\nto help Sir Launcelot. For that night, or the day after, Sir Launcelot\r\nshould come where these thirty knights were. And so this damosel met\r\nwith Sir Bors and Sir Ector and with Sir Driant, and there she told\r\nthem all four of the treason of Morgan le Fay; and then they promised\r\nher that they would be nigh where Sir Launcelot should meet with the\r\nthirty knights. And if so be they set upon him we will do rescues as we\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nSo the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with Sir\r\nTristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there the damosel told them all the\r\ntreason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir\r\nTristram, bring me to that same place where they should meet with Sir\r\nLauncelot. Then said Sir Dinadan: What will ye do? it is not for us to\r\nfight with thirty knights, and wit you well I will not thereof; as to\r\nmatch one knight two or three is enough an they be men, but for to\r\nmatch fifteen knights that will I never undertake. Fie for shame, said\r\nSir Tristram, do but your part. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will not\r\nthereof but if ye will lend me your shield, for ye bear a shield of\r\nCornwall; and for the cowardice that is named to the knights of\r\nCornwall, by your shields ye be ever forborne. Nay, said Sir Tristram,\r\nI will not depart from my shield for her sake that gave it me. But one\r\nthing, said Sir Tristram, I promise thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt\r\npromise me to abide with me, here I shall slay thee, for I desire no\r\nmore of thee but answer one knight. And if thy heart will not serve\r\nthee, stand by and look upon me and them. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I\r\npromise you to look upon and to do what I may to save myself, but I\r\nwould I had not met with you.\r\n\r\nSo then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four knights, and\r\nthey were ware of them, and either of other. And so these thirty\r\nknights let them pass, for this cause, that they would not wrath them,\r\nif case be that they had ado with Sir Launcelot; and the four knights\r\nlet them pass to this intent, that they would see and behold what they\r\nwould do with Sir Launcelot. And so the thirty knights passed on and\r\ncame by Sir Tristram and by Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on\r\nhigh: Lo, here is a knight against you for the love of Sir Launcelot.\r\nAnd there he slew two with one spear and ten with his sword. And then\r\ncame in Sir Dinadan and he did passing well, and so of the thirty\r\nknights there went but ten away, and they fled. All this battle saw Sir\r\nBors de Ganis and his three fellows, and then they saw well it was the\r\nsame knight that jousted with them at the bridge; then they took their\r\nhorses and rode unto Sir Tristram, and praised him and thanked him of\r\nhis good deeds, and they all desired Sir Tristram to go with them to\r\ntheir lodging; and he said: Nay, he would not go to no lodging. Then\r\nthey all four knights prayed him to tell them his name. Fair lords,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, as at this time I will not tell you my name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan came to a lodging where\r\nthey must joust with two knights.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode forth their way till they came\r\nto the shepherds and to the herdmen, and there they asked them if they\r\nknew any lodging or harbour there nigh hand. Forsooth, sirs, said the\r\nherdmen, hereby is good lodging in a castle; but there is such a custom\r\nthat there shall no knight be harboured but if he joust with two\r\nknights, and if he be but one knight he must joust with two. And as ye\r\nbe therein soon shall ye be matched. There is shrewd harbour, said Sir\r\nDinadan; lodge where ye will, for I will not lodge there. Fie for\r\nshame, said Sir Tristram, are ye not a knight of the Table Round?\r\nwherefore ye may not with your worship refuse your lodging. Not so,\r\nsaid the herdmen, for an ye be beaten and have the worse ye shall not\r\nbe lodged there, and if ye beat them ye shall be well harboured. Ah,\r\nsaid Sir Dinadan, they are two sure knights. Then Sir Dinadan would not\r\nlodge there in no manner but as Sir Tristram required him of his\r\nknighthood; and so they rode thither. And to make short tale, Sir\r\nTristram and Sir Dinadan smote them down both, and so they entered into\r\nthe castle and had good cheer as they could think or devise.\r\n\r\nAnd when they were unarmed, and thought to be merry and in good rest,\r\nthere came in at the gates Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris, requiring to\r\nhave the custom of the castle. What array is this? said Sir Dinadan, I\r\nwould have my rest. That may not be, said Sir Tristram; now must we\r\nneeds defend the custom of this castle, insomuch as we have the better\r\nof the lords of this castle, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, needs\r\nmust ye make you ready. In the devil\xe2\x80\x99s name, said Sir Dinadan, came I\r\ninto your company. And so they made them ready; and Sir Gaheris\r\nencountered with Sir Tristram, and Sir Gaheris had a fall; and Sir\r\nPalomides encountered with Sir Dinadan, and Sir Dinadan had a fall:\r\nthen was it fall for fall. So then must they fight on foot. That would\r\nnot Sir Dinadan, for he was so sore bruised of the fall that Sir\r\nPalomides gave him. Then Sir Tristram unlaced Sir Dinadan\xe2\x80\x99s helm, and\r\nprayed him to help him. I will not, said Sir Dinadan, for I am sore\r\nwounded of the thirty knights that we had but late ago to do withal.\r\nBut ye fare, said Sir Dinadan unto Sir Tristram, as a madman and as a\r\nman that is out of his mind that would cast himself away, and I may\r\ncurse the time that ever I saw you, for in all the world are not two\r\nsuch knights that be so wood as is Sir Launcelot and ye Sir Tristram;\r\nfor once I fell in the fellowship of Sir Launcelot as I have done now\r\nwith you, and he set me a work that a quarter of a year I kept my bed.\r\nJesu defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from such two knights, and specially\r\nfrom your fellowship. Then, said Sir Tristram, I will fight with them\r\nboth. Then Sir Tristram bade them come forth both, for I will fight\r\nwith you. Then Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris dressed them, and smote at\r\nthem both. Then Dinadan smote at Sir Gaheris a stroke or two, and\r\nturned from him. Nay, said Sir Palomides, it is too much shame for us\r\ntwo knights to fight with one. And then he did bid Sir Gaheris stand\r\naside with that knight that hath no list to fight. Then they rode\r\ntogether and fought long, and at the last Sir Tristram doubled his\r\nstrokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback more than three strides. And\r\nthen by one assent Sir Gaheris and Sir Dinadan went betwixt them, and\r\ndeparted them in-sunder. And then by assent of Sir Tristram they would\r\nhave lodged together. But Sir Dinadan would not lodge in that castle.\r\nAnd then he cursed the time that ever he came in their fellowship, and\r\nso he took his horse, and his harness, and departed.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lend him a man to\r\nbring him to a lodging, and so they did, and overtook Sir Dinadan, and\r\nrode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory, and\r\nthere they were well at ease. And that same night Sir Bors and Sir\r\nBleoberis, and Sir Ector and Sir Driant, abode still in the same place\r\nthereas Sir Tristram fought with the thirty knights; and there they met\r\nwith Sir Launcelot the same night, and had made promise to lodge with\r\nSir Colgrevance the same night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore\r\nle Desirous, and how Sir Gawaine turned Sir Tristram from Morgan le\r\nFay.\r\n\r\nBut anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield of\r\nCornwall, then wist he well that it was Sir Tristram that fought with\r\nhis enemies. And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir Tristram, and called\r\nhim the man of most worship in the world. So there was a knight in that\r\npriory that hight Pellinore, and he desired to wit the name of Sir\r\nTristram, but in no wise he could not; and so Sir Tristram departed and\r\nleft Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he was so weary and so sore bruised\r\nthat he might not ride. Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir\r\nDinadan: Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight\xe2\x80\x99s name I will ride\r\nafter him and make him to tell me his name, or he shall die therefore.\r\nBeware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye follow him ye shall\r\nrepent it. So that knight, Sir Pellinore, rode after Sir Tristram and\r\nrequired him of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him down and wounded\r\nhim through the shoulder, and so he passed on his way. And on the next\r\nday following Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and they told him that\r\nthere was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of\r\nScotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust against\r\nother at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all the\r\ncountry after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let make\r\nseeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgalis let seek\r\nafter Sir Tristram de Liones. And at that time Sir Tristram thought to\r\nbe at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the\r\nSeneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir\r\nTristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him, because he\r\nwould not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be\r\nbefore the Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him and\r\nto rest him. And alway Sir Kay cried: Sir knight of Cornwall, joust\r\nwith me, or else yield thee to me as recreant. When Sir Tristram heard\r\nhim say so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay refused him and turned\r\nhis back. Then Sir Tristram said: As I find thee I shall take thee.\r\nThen Sir Kay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay\r\ndown, and so he rode forth.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him to\r\njoust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le\r\nDesirous from his horse, and rode his way; and the same day he met with\r\na damosel that told him that he should win great worship of a knight\r\nadventurous that did much harm in all that country. When Sir Tristram\r\nheard her say so, he was glad to go with her to win worship. So Sir\r\nTristram rode with that damosel a six mile, and then met him Sir\r\nGawaine, and therewithal Sir Gawaine knew the damosel, that she was a\r\ndamosel of Queen Morgan le Fay. Then Sir Gawaine understood that she\r\nled that knight to some mischief. Fair knight, said Sir Gawaine,\r\nwhither ride you now with that damosel? Sir, said Sir Tristram, I wot\r\nnot whither I shall ride but as the damosel will lead me. Sir, said Sir\r\nGawaine, ye shall not ride with her, for she and her lady did never\r\ngood, but ill. And then Sir Gawaine pulled out his sword and said:\r\nDamosel, but if thou tell me anon for what cause thou leadest this\r\nknight with thee thou shalt die for it right anon: I know all your\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s treason, and yours. Mercy, Sir Gawaine, she said, and if ye will\r\nsave my life I will tell you. Say on, said Sir Gawaine, and thou shalt\r\nhave thy life. Sir, she said, Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath\r\nordained a thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir\r\nTristram, and by the trains of these ladies, who that may first meet\r\nany of these two knights they should turn them unto Morgan le Fay\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncastle, saying that they should do deeds of worship; and if any of the\r\ntwo knights came there, there be thirty knights lying and watching in a\r\ntower to wait upon Sir Launcelot or upon Sir Tristram. Fie for shame,\r\nsaid Sir Gawaine, that ever such false treason should be wrought or\r\nused in a queen, and a king\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and a king and queen\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Gawaine rode to have foughten\r\nwith the thirty knights, but they durst not come out.\r\n\r\nSir, said Sir Gawaine, will ye stand with me, and we will see the\r\nmalice of these thirty knights. Sir, said Sir Tristram, go ye to them,\r\nan it please you, and ye shall see I will not fail you, for it is not\r\nlong ago since I and a fellow met with thirty knights of that queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfellowship; and God speed us so that we may win worship. So then Sir\r\nGawaine and Sir Tristram rode toward the castle where Morgan le Fay\r\nwas, and ever Sir Gawaine deemed well that he was Sir Tristram de\r\nLiones, because he heard that two knights had slain and beaten thirty\r\nknights. And when they came afore the castle Sir Gawaine spake on high\r\nand said: Queen Morgan le Fay, send out your knights that ye have laid\r\nin a watch for Sir Launcelot and for Sir Tristram. Now, said Sir\r\nGawaine, I know your false treason, and through all places where that I\r\nride men shall know of your false treason; and now let see, said Sir\r\nGawaine, whether ye dare come out of your castle, ye thirty knights.\r\nThen the queen spake and all the thirty knights at once, and said: Sir\r\nGawaine, full well wottest thou what thou dost and sayest; for by God\r\nwe know thee passing well, but all that thou speakest and dost, thou\r\nsayest it upon pride of that good knight that is there with thee. For\r\nthere be some of us that know full well the hands of that knight over\r\nall well. And wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, it is more for his sake than\r\nfor thine that we will not come out of this castle. For wit ye well,\r\nSir Gawaine, the knight that beareth the arms of Cornwall, we know him\r\nand what he is.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram departed and rode on their ways a day\r\nor two together; and there by adventure, they met with Sir Kay and Sir\r\nSagramore le Desirous. And then they were glad of Sir Gawaine, and he\r\nof them, but they wist not what he was with the shield of Cornwall, but\r\nby deeming. And thus they rode together a day or two. And then they\r\nwere ware of Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9 chasing a lady for to have slain\r\nher, for he had slain her paramour afore. Hold you all still, said Sir\r\nGawaine, and show none of you forth, and ye shall see me reward yonder\r\nfalse knight; for an he espy you he is so well horsed that he will\r\nescape away. And then Sir Gawaine rode betwixt Sir Breuse and the lady,\r\nand said: False knight, leave her, and have ado with me. When Sir\r\nBreuse saw no more but Sir Gawaine he feutred his spear, and Sir\r\nGawaine against him; and there Sir Breuse overthrew Sir Gawaine, and\r\nthen he rode over him, and overthwart him twenty times to have\r\ndestroyed him; and when Sir Tristram saw him do so villainous a deed,\r\nhe hurled out against him. And when Sir Breuse saw him with the shield\r\nof Cornwall he knew him well that it was Sir Tristram, and then he\r\nfled, and Sir Tristram followed after him; and Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9\r\nwas so horsed that he went his way quite, and Sir Tristram followed him\r\nlong, for he would fain have been avenged upon him. And so when he had\r\nlong chased him, he saw a fair well, and thither he rode to repose him,\r\nand tied his horse till a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. How damosel Bragwaine found Tristram sleeping by a well,\r\nand how she delivered letters to him from La Beale Isoud.\r\n\r\nAnd then he pulled off his helm and washed his visage and his hands,\r\nand so he fell asleep. In the meanwhile came a damosel that had sought\r\nSir Tristram many ways and days within this land. And when she came to\r\nthe well she looked upon him, and had forgotten him as in remembrance\r\nof Sir Tristram, but by his horse she knew him, that hight Passe-Brewel\r\nthat had been Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s horse many years. For when he was mad in\r\nthe forest Sir Fergus kept him. So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, abode\r\nstill till he was awake. So when she saw him wake she saluted him, and\r\nhe her again, for either knew other of old acquaintance; then she told\r\nhim how she had sought him long and broad, and there she told him how\r\nshe had letters from Queen La Beale Isoud. Then anon Sir Tristram read\r\nthem, and wit ye well he was glad, for therein was many a piteous\r\ncomplaint. Then Sir Tristram said: Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with\r\nme till that tournament be done at the Castle of Maidens, and then\r\nshall bear letters and tidings with you. And then Sir Tristram took his\r\nhorse and sought lodging, and there he met with a good ancient knight\r\nand prayed him to lodge with him. Right so came Gouvernail unto Sir\r\nTristram, that was glad of that lady. So this old knight\xe2\x80\x99s name was Sir\r\nPellounes, and he told of the great tournament that should be at the\r\nCastle of Maidens. And there Sir Launcelot and thirty-two knights of\r\nhis blood had ordained shields of Cornwall. And right so there came one\r\nunto Sir Pellounes, and told him that Sir Persides de Bloise was come\r\nhome; then that knight held up his hands and thanked God of his coming\r\nhome. And there Sir Pellounes told Sir Tristram that in two years he\r\nhad not seen his son, Sir Persides. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know your\r\nson well enough for a good knight.\r\n\r\nSo on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging both\r\nat once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their clothing.\r\nAnd then these two knights each welcomed other. And when Sir Persides\r\nunderstood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall, he said he was once in\r\nCornwall: And there I jousted afore King Mark; and so it happed me at\r\nthat time to overthrow ten knights, and then came to me Sir Tristram de\r\nLiones and overthrew me, and took my lady away from me, and that shall\r\nI never forget, but I shall remember me an ever I see my time. Ah, said\r\nSir Tristram, now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram. What deem ye,\r\nween ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your malice? Yes,\r\nsaid Sir Persides, I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble knight and\r\na much better knight than I, yet shall I not owe him my good will.\r\nRight as they stood thus talking at a bay-window of that castle, they\r\nsaw many knights riding to and fro toward the tournament. And then was\r\nSir Tristram ware of a likely knight riding upon a great black horse,\r\nand a black-covered shield. What knight is that, said Sir Tristram,\r\nwith the black horse and the black shield? he seemeth a good knight. I\r\nknow him well, said Sir Persides, he is one of the best knights of the\r\nworld. Then is it Sir Launcelot, said Tristram. Nay, said Sir Persides,\r\nit is Sir Palomides, that is yet unchristened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and how\r\nLauncelot overthrew two knights.\r\n\r\nThen they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. And\r\nwithin a while after there came a squire of the castle, that told Sir\r\nPellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight with a black\r\nshield had smitten down thirteen knights. Fair brother, said Sir\r\nTristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us cloaks, and let us go\r\nsee the play. Not so, said Sir Persides, we will not go like knaves\r\nthither, but we will ride like men and good knights to withstand our\r\nenemies. So they armed them, and took their horses and great spears,\r\nand thither they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the\r\ntournament. And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he sent a\r\nsquire unto him and said: Go thou to the yonder knight with the green\r\nshield and therein a lion of gold, and say him I require him to joust\r\nwith me, and tell him that my name is Sir Palomides. When Sir Persides\r\nunderstood that request of Sir Palomides, he made him ready, and there\r\nanon they met together, but Sir Persides had a fall. Then Sir Tristram\r\ndressed him to be revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir\r\nPalomides that was ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him at\r\nan advantage and smote him over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail when he had no spear\r\nin his rest. Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his horse lightly, and\r\nwas wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall. Then Sir\r\nTristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed him to joust\r\nwith him at his request. Nay, said Sir Palomides, as at this time I\r\nwill not joust with that knight, for I know him better than he weeneth.\r\nAnd if he be wroth he may right it to-morn at the Castle of Maidens,\r\nwhere he may see me and many other knights.\r\n\r\nWith that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he list\r\nnot to jape. Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be a man never\r\nso good yet may he have a fall, and he was never so wise but he might\r\nbe overseen, and he rideth well that never fell. So Sir Tristram was\r\npassing wroth, and said to Sir Persides and to Sir Dinadan: I will\r\nrevenge me. Right so as they stood talking there, there came by Sir\r\nTristram a likely knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a\r\nblack shield. What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides.\r\nI know him well, said Sir Persides, for his name is Sir Briant of North\r\nWales; so he passed on among other knights of North Wales. And there\r\ncame in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the arms of Cornwall,\r\nand he sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and required him to joust with\r\nhim. Well, said Sir Briant, sithen I am required to joust I will do\r\nwhat I may; and there Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his\r\nhorse a great fall. And then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was\r\nthat bare the shield of Cornwall. Whatsoever he be, said Sir Dinadan, I\r\nwarrant you he is of King Ban\xe2\x80\x99s blood, the which be knights of the most\r\nnoble prowess in the world, for to account so many for so many. Then\r\nthere came two knights of Northgalis, that one hight Hew de la\r\nMontaine, and the other Sir Madok de la Montaine, and they challenged\r\nSir Launcelot foot-hot. Sir Launcelot not refusing them but made him\r\nready, with one spear he smote them down both over their horses\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncroups; and so Sir Launcelot rode his way. By the good lord, said Sir\r\nTristram, he is a good knight that beareth the shield of Cornwall, and\r\nmeseemeth he rideth in the best manner that ever I saw knight ride.\r\n\r\nThen the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed him\r\nheartily for his sake to joust with that knight that hath done us of\r\nNorthgalis despite. Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am full loath to have\r\nado with that knight, and cause why is, for as to-morn the great\r\ntournament shall be; and therefore I will keep myself fresh by my will.\r\nNay, said the King of Northgalis, I pray you require him of jousts.\r\nSir, said Sir Palomides, I will joust at your request, and require that\r\nknight to joust with me, and often I have seen a man have a fall at his\r\nown request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew\r\nhim, and after he was assailed with twelve knights.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required him\r\nof jousts. Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, tell me thy lord\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\nSir, said the squire, my lord\xe2\x80\x99s name is Sir Palomides, the good knight.\r\nIn good hour, said Sir Launcelot, for there is no knight that I saw\r\nthis seven years that I had liefer ado withal than with him. And so\r\neither knights made them ready with two great spears. Nay, said Sir\r\nDinadan, ye shall see that Sir Palomides will quit him right well. It\r\nmay be so, said Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the\r\nshield of Cornwall shall give him a fall. I believe it not, said Sir\r\nDinadan. Right so they spurred their horses and feutred their spears,\r\nand either hit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear upon Sir\r\nLauncelot, and he sat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot smote him so\r\nlightly that he made his horse to avoid the saddle, and the stroke\r\nbrake his shield and the hauberk, and had he not fallen he had been\r\nslain. How now, said Sir Tristram, I wist well by the manner of their\r\nriding both that Sir Palomides should have a fall.\r\n\r\nRight so Sir Launcelot rode his way, and rode to a well to drink and to\r\nrepose him, and they of Northgalis espied him whither he rode; and then\r\nthere followed him twelve knights for to have mischieved him, for this\r\ncause that upon the morn at the tournament of the Castle of Maidens\r\nthat he should not win the victory. So they came upon Sir Launcelot\r\nsuddenly, and unnethe he might put upon him his helm and take his\r\nhorse, but they were in hands with him; and then Sir Launcelot gat his\r\nspear, and rode through them, and there he slew a knight and brake a\r\nspear in his body. Then he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand\r\nand upon the left hand, so that within a few strokes he had slain other\r\nthree knights, and the remnant that abode he wounded them sore all that\r\ndid abide. Thus Sir Launcelot escaped from his enemies of North Wales,\r\nand then Sir Launcelot rode his way till a friend, and lodged him till\r\non the morn; for he would not the first day have ado in the tournament\r\nbecause of his great labour. And on the first day he was with King\r\nArthur thereas he was set on high upon a scaffold to discern who was\r\nbest worthy of his deeds. So Sir Launcelot was with King Arthur, and\r\njousted not the first day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Tristram behaved him the first day of the\r\ntournament, and there he had the prize.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones, that commanded Gouvernail, his\r\nservant, to ordain him a black shield with none other remembrance\r\ntherein. And so Sir Persides and Sir Tristram departed from their host\r\nSir Pellounes, and they rode early toward the tournament, and then they\r\ndrew them to King Carados\xe2\x80\x99 side, of Scotland; and anon knights began\r\nthe field what of King Northgalis\xe2\x80\x99 part, and what of King Carados\xe2\x80\x99\r\npart, and there began great party. Then there was hurling and rashing.\r\nRight so came in Sir Persides and Sir Tristram and so they did fare\r\nthat they put the King of Northgalis aback. Then came in Sir Bleoberis\r\nde Ganis and Sir Gaheris with them of Northgalis, and then was Sir\r\nPersides smitten down and almost slain, for more than forty horse men\r\nwent over him. For Sir Bleoberis did great deeds of arms, and Sir\r\nGaheris failed him not. When Sir Tristram beheld them, and saw them do\r\nsuch deeds of arms, he marvelled what they were. Also Sir Tristram\r\nthought shame that Sir Persides was so done to; and then he gat a great\r\nspear in his hand, and then he rode to Sir Gaheris and smote him down\r\nfrom his horse. And then was Sir Bleoberis wroth, and gat a spear and\r\nrode against Sir Tristram in great ire; and there Sir Tristram met with\r\nhim, and smote Sir Bleoberis from his horse. So then the King with the\r\nHundred Knights was wroth, and he horsed Sir Bleoberis and Sir Gaheris\r\nagain, and there began a great medley; and ever Sir Tristram held them\r\npassing short, and ever Sir Bleoberis was passing busy upon Sir\r\nTristram; and there came Sir Dinadan against Sir Tristram, and Sir\r\nTristram gave him such a buffet that he swooned in his saddle. Then\r\nanon Sir Dinadan came to Sir Tristram and said: Sir, I know thee better\r\nthan thou weenest; but here I promise thee my troth I will never come\r\nagainst thee more, for I promise thee that sword of thine shall never\r\ncome on mine helm.\r\n\r\nWith that came Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet\r\nthat down he laid his head; and then he caught him so sore by the helm\r\nthat he pulled him under his horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet. And then King Arthur blew to\r\nlodging. Then Sir Tristram departed to his pavilion, and Sir Dinadan\r\nrode with him; and Sir Persides and King Arthur then, and the kings\r\nupon both parties, marvelled what knight that was with the black\r\nshield. Many said their advice, and some knew him for Sir Tristram, and\r\nheld their peace and would nought say. So that first day King Arthur,\r\nand all the kings and lords that were judges, gave Sir Tristram the\r\nprize; howbeit they knew him not, but named him the Knight with the\r\nBlack Shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s party\r\nbecause he saw Sir Palomides on that party.\r\n\r\nThen upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of Northgalis,\r\nand rode to King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s side, where was King Carados, and the King of\r\nIreland, and Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s kin, and Sir Gawaine\xe2\x80\x99s kin. So Sir\r\nPalomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he sent to seek him\r\nwhen he was out of his mind in the forest, and this damosel asked Sir\r\nTristram what he was and what was his name?\r\n\r\nAs for that, said Sir Tristram, tell Sir Palomides ye shall not wit as\r\nat this time unto the time I have broken two spears upon him. But let\r\nhim wit thus much, said Sir Tristram, that I am the same knight that he\r\nsmote down in over evening at the tournament; and tell him plainly on\r\nwhat party that Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party.\r\n\r\nSir, said the damosel, ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will be\r\non King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s side, where the most noble knights of the world be. In\r\nthe name of God, said Sir Tristram, then will I be with the King of\r\nNorthgalis, because Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s side, and\r\nelse I would not but for his sake. So when King Arthur was come they\r\nblew unto the field; and then there began a great party, and so King\r\nCarados jousted with the King of the Hundred Knights, and there King\r\nCarados had a fall: then was there hurling and rushing, and right so\r\ncame in knights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s, and they bare aback the King of\r\nNorthgalis\xe2\x80\x99 knights.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that there\r\nwas none might withstand him, and thus Sir Tristram dured long. And at\r\nthe last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban, and there\r\nfell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir\r\nBlamore de Ganis, and many other knights. And then Sir Tristram smote\r\non the right hand and on the left hand, that all lords and ladies spake\r\nof his noble deeds. But at the last Sir Tristram should have had the\r\nworse had not the King with the Hundred Knights been. And then he came\r\nwith his fellowship and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him away from\r\nthose knights that bare the shields of Cornwall. And then Sir Tristram\r\nsaw another fellowship by themself, and there were a forty knights\r\ntogether, and Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their governor. Then Sir\r\nTristram rode in amongst them, and there he smote down Sir Kay from his\r\nhorse; and there he fared among those knights like a greyhound among\r\nconies.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the head.\r\nSir, said Sir Launcelot, who wounded you so sore? Sir, he said, a\r\nknight that beareth a black shield, and I may curse the time that ever\r\nI met with him, for he is a devil and no man. So Sir Launcelot departed\r\nfrom him and thought to meet with Sir Tristram, and so he rode with his\r\nsword drawn in his hand to seek Sir Tristram; and then he espied him\r\nhow he hurled here and there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh\r\nsmote down a knight. O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare\r\narms saw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms. And if I\r\nshould set upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did shame\r\nto myself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his sword. And then the\r\nKing with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of North Wales set\r\nupon the twenty of Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s kin: and they twenty knights held\r\nthem ever together as wild swine, and none would fail other. And so\r\nwhen Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse of these twenty knights he\r\nmarvelled of their good deeds, for he saw by their fare and by their\r\nrule that they had liefer die than avoid the field. Now Jesu, said Sir\r\nTristram, well may he be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a\r\nsort of noble knights unto his kin, and full like is he to be a noble\r\nman that is their leader and governor. He meant it by Sir Launcelot du\r\nLake. So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he thought shame to\r\nsee two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights. Then Sir\r\nTristram rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and said: Sir,\r\nleave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye win no worship of\r\nthem, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye well they will not out\r\nof the field I see by their cheer and countenance; and worship get ye\r\nnone an ye slay them. Therefore leave your fighting with them, for I to\r\nincrease my worship I will ride to the twenty knights and help them\r\nwith all my might and power. Nay, said the King with the Hundred\r\nKnights, ye shall not do so; now I see your courage and courtesy I will\r\nwithdraw my knights for your pleasure, for evermore a good knight will\r\nfavour another, and like will draw to like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought\r\nhim with him to his lodging.\r\n\r\nThen the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his knights. And all\r\nthis while, and long to-fore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon Sir\r\nTristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him. And then\r\nsuddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode their\r\nway into the forest, that no man perceived where they went. So then\r\nKing Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the King of Northgalis the\r\nprize because Sir Tristram was upon his side. Then Sir Launcelot rode\r\nhere and there, so wood as lion that fauted his fill, because he had\r\nlost Sir Tristram, and so he returned unto King Arthur. And then in all\r\nthe field was a noise that with the wind it might be heard two mile\r\nthence, how the lords and ladies cried: The Knight with the Black\r\nShield hath won the field. Alas, said King Arthur, where is that knight\r\nbecome? It is shame to all those in the field so to let him escape away\r\nfrom you; but with gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him\r\nunto me to the Castle of Maidens. Then the noble King Arthur went unto\r\nhis knights and comforted them in the best wise that he could, and\r\nsaid: My fair fellows, be not dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field\r\nthis day. And many were hurt and sore wounded, and many were whole. My\r\nfellows, said King Arthur, look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn I\r\nwill be in the field with you and revenge you of your enemies. So that\r\nnight King Arthur and his knights reposed themself.\r\n\r\nThe damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all the\r\nwhile the tournament was a-doing she was with Queen Guenever, and ever\r\nthe queen asked her for what cause she came into that country. Madam,\r\nshe answered, I come for none other cause but from my lady La Beale\r\nIsoud to wit of your welfare. For in no wise she would not tell the\r\nqueen that she came for Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s sake. So this lady, Dame\r\nBragwaine, took her leave of Queen Guenever, and she rode after Sir\r\nTristram. And as she rode through the forest she heard a great cry;\r\nthen she commanded her squire to go into the forest to wit what was\r\nthat noise. And so he came to a well, and there he found a knight\r\nbounden till a tree crying as he had been wood, and his horse and his\r\nharness standing by him. And when he espied that squire, therewith he\r\nabraid and brake himself loose, and took his sword in his hand, and ran\r\nto have slain the squire. Then he took his horse and fled all that ever\r\nhe might unto Dame Bragwaine, and told her of his adventure. Then she\r\nrode unto Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion, and told Sir Tristram what adventure\r\nshe had found in the forest. Alas, said Sir Tristram, upon my head\r\nthere is some good knight at mischief.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Tristram took his horse and his sword and rode thither, and\r\nthere he heard how the knight complained unto himself and said: I,\r\nwoful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth me, that thus\r\nam defoiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir Bors and Sir Ector.\r\nAlas, he said, why live I so long! And then he gat his sword in his\r\nhands, and made many strange signs and tokens; and so through his\r\nraging he threw his sword into that fountain. Then Sir Palomides wailed\r\nand wrang his hands. And at the last for pure sorrow he ran into that\r\nfountain, over his belly, and sought after his sword. Then Sir Tristram\r\nsaw that, and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him in his arms fast.\r\nWhat art thou, said Palomides, that holdeth me so? I am a man of this\r\nforest that would thee none harm. Alas, said Sir Palomides, I may never\r\nwin worship where Sir Tristram is; for ever where he is an I be there,\r\nthen get I no worship; and if he be away for the most part I have the\r\ngree, unless that Sir Launcelot be there or Sir Lamorak. Then Sir\r\nPalomides said: Once in Ireland Sir Tristram put me to the worse, and\r\nanother time in Cornwall, and in other places in this land. What would\r\nye do, said Sir Tristram, an ye had Sir Tristram? I would fight with\r\nhim, said Sir Palomides, and ease my heart upon him; and yet, to say\r\nthee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in this world living.\r\nWhat will ye do, said Sir Tristram, will ye go with me to your lodging?\r\nNay, said he, I will go to the King with the Hundred Knights, for he\r\nrescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector and else had I been\r\nslain traitorly. Sir Tristram said him such kind words that Sir\r\nPalomides went with him to his lodging. Then Gouvernail went to-fore,\r\nand charged Dame Bragwaine to go out of the way to her lodging. And bid\r\nye Sir Persides that he make him no quarrels. And so they rode together\r\ntill they came to Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion, and there Sir Palomides had\r\nall the cheer that might be had all that night. But in no wise Sir\r\nPalomides might not know what was Sir Tristram; and so after supper\r\nthey yede to rest, and Sir Tristram for great travail slept till it was\r\nday. And Sir Palomides might not sleep for anguish; and in the dawning\r\nof the day he took his horse privily, and rode his way unto Sir Gaheris\r\nand unto Sir Sagramore le Desirous, where they were in their pavilions;\r\nfor they three were fellows at the beginning of the tournament. And\r\nthen upon the morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he\r\njousted with King Arthur, and other feats.\r\n\r\nSo the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights, they\r\ntwo encountered with King Carados and with the King of Ireland; and\r\nthere the King with the Hundred Knights smote down King Carados, and\r\nthe King of Northgalis smote down the King of Ireland. With that came\r\nin Sir Palomides, and when he came he made great work, for by his\r\nindented shield he was well known. So came in King Arthur, and did\r\ngreat deeds of arms together, and put the King of Northgalis and the\r\nKing with the Hundred Knights to the worse. With this came in Sir\r\nTristram with his black shield, and anon he jousted with Sir Palomides,\r\nand there by fine force Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides over his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s croup. Then King Arthur cried: Knight with the Black Shield,\r\nmake thee ready to me, and in the same wise Sir Tristram smote King\r\nArthur. And then by force of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights the King and Sir\r\nPalomides were horsed again. Then King Arthur with a great eager heart\r\nhe gat a spear in his hand, and there upon the one side he smote Sir\r\nTristram over his horse. Then foot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir\r\nTristram, as he was upon foot, to have overridden him. Then Sir\r\nTristram was ware of him, and there he stooped aside, and with great\r\nire he gat him by the arm, and pulled him down from his horse. Then Sir\r\nPalomides lightly arose, and then they dashed together mightily with\r\ntheir swords; and many kings, queens, and lords, stood and beheld them.\r\nAnd at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides upon the helm three\r\nmighty strokes, and at every stroke that he gave him he said: This for\r\nSir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s sake. With that Sir Palomides fell to the earth\r\ngrovelling.\r\n\r\nThen came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir Tristram\r\nan horse, and so was he horsed again. By then was Sir Palomides horsed,\r\nand with great ire he jousted upon Sir Tristram with his spear as it\r\nwas in the rest, and gave him a great dash with his sword. Then Sir\r\nTristram avoided his spear, and gat him by the neck with his both\r\nhands, and pulled him clean out of his saddle, and so he bare him afore\r\nhim the length of ten spears, and then in the presence of them all he\r\nlet him fall at his adventure. Then Sir Tristram was ware of King\r\nArthur with a naked sword in his hand, and with his spear Sir Tristram\r\nran upon King Arthur; and then King Arthur boldly abode him and with\r\nhis sword he smote a-two his spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram\r\nstonied; and so King Arthur gave him three or four strokes or he might\r\nget out his sword, and at the last Sir Tristram drew his sword and\r\n[either] assailed other passing hard. With that the great press\r\ndeparted [them]. Then Sir Tristram rode here and there and did his\r\ngreat pain, that eleven of the good knights of the blood of King Ban,\r\nthat was of Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s kin, that day Sir Tristram smote down; that\r\nall the estates marvelled of his great deeds and all cried upon the\r\nKnight with the Black Shield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after Sir\r\nTristram smote down Sir Palomides.\r\n\r\nThen this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it. And then he gat\r\na great spear in his hand and came towards the cry. Then Sir Launcelot\r\ncried: The Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to joust with\r\nme. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he gat his spear in his hand,\r\nand either abashed down their heads, and came together as thunder; and\r\nSir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s spear brake in pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune\r\nstruck Sir Tristram on the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet\r\nSir Tristram avoided not his saddle, and so the spear brake.\r\nTherewithal Sir Tristram that was wounded gat out his sword, and he\r\nrushed to Sir Launcelot, and gave him three great strokes upon the helm\r\nthat the fire sprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his head lowly\r\ntoward his saddle-bow. And therewithal Sir Tristram departed from the\r\nfield, for he felt him so wounded that he weened he should have died;\r\nand Sir Dinadan espied him and followed him into the forest. Then Sir\r\nLauncelot abode and did many marvellous deeds.\r\n\r\nSo when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest\xe2\x80\x99s side he alighted, and\r\nunlaced his harness and freshed his wound; then weened Sir Dinadan that\r\nhe should have died. Nay, nay, said Sir Tristram, Dinadan never dread\r\nthee, for I am heart-whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by\r\nthe mercy of God. By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides\r\nriding straight upon them. And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir\r\nPalomides came to have destroyed him. And so Sir Dinadan gave him\r\nwarning, and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that\r\nye may not have ado with him, therefore I will ride against him and do\r\nto him what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul; and in\r\nthe meanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle, or in the\r\nforest, that he shall not meet with you. Sir Tristram smiled and said:\r\nI thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good will, but ye shall wit that I am\r\nable to handle him. And then anon hastily he armed him, and took his\r\nhorse, and a great spear in his hand, and said to Sir Dinadan: Adieu;\r\nand rode toward Sir Palomides a soft pace. Then when Sir Palomides saw\r\nthat, he made countenance to amend his horse, but he did it for this\r\ncause, for he abode Sir Gaheris that came after him. And when he was\r\ncome he rode toward Sir Tristram. Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir\r\nPalomides, and required him to joust with him; and if he smote down Sir\r\nPalomides he would do no more to him; and if it so happened that Sir\r\nPalomides smote down Sir Tristram, he bade him do his utterance. So\r\nthey were accorded. Then they met together, and Sir Tristram smote down\r\nSir Palomides that he had a grievous fall, so that he lay still as he\r\nhad been dead. And then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he would\r\nnot have jousted; but whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote him\r\nover his horse\xe2\x80\x99s croup, that he lay still as though he had been dead.\r\nAnd then Sir Tristram rode his way and left Sir Persides\xe2\x80\x99 squire within\r\nthe pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace to lodge them. And that old knight had five sons at the\r\ntournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their coming home. And\r\nso, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir Launcelot held alway\r\nthe stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself, and\r\nwit ye well there was many a noble knight against him. And when King\r\nArthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous deeds of arms he then armed\r\nhim, and took his horse and his armour, and rode into the field to help\r\nSir Launcelot; and so many knights came in with King Arthur. And to\r\nmake short tale in conclusion, the King of Northgalis and the King of\r\nthe Hundred Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir Launcelot\r\nabode and was the last in the field the prize was given him. But Sir\r\nLauncelot would neither for king, queen, nor knight, have the prize,\r\nbut where the cry was cried through the field: Sir Launcelot, Sir\r\nLauncelot hath won the field this day, Sir Launcelot let make another\r\ncry contrary: Sir Tristram hath won the field, for he began first, and\r\nlast he hath endured, and so hath he done the first day, the second,\r\nand the third day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How the prize of the third day was given to Sir\r\nLauncelot, and Sir Launcelot gave it to Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nThen all the estates and degrees high and low said of Sir Launcelot\r\ngreat worship, for the honour that he did unto Sir Tristram; and for\r\nthat honour doing to Sir Tristram he was at that time more praised and\r\nrenowned than an he had overthrown five hundred knights; and all the\r\npeople wholly for this gentleness, first the estates both high and low,\r\nand after the commonalty cried at once: Sir Launcelot hath won the\r\nfield whosoever say nay. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth and ashamed, and\r\nso therewithal he rode to King Arthur. Alas, said the king, we are all\r\ndismayed that Sir Tristram is thus departed from us. By God, said King\r\nArthur, he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw hold spear or\r\nsword in hand, and the most courteoust knight in his fighting; for full\r\nhard I saw him, said King Arthur, when he smote Sir Palomides upon the\r\nhelm thrice, that he abashed his helm with his strokes, and also he\r\nsaid: Here is a stroke for Sir Tristram, and thus thrice he said. Then\r\nKing Arthur, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Dodinas le Savage took their horses\r\nto seek Sir Tristram, and by the means of Sir Persides he had told King\r\nArthur where Sir Tristram was in his pavilion. But when they came\r\nthere, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan were gone.\r\n\r\nThen King Arthur and Sir Launcelot were heavy, and returned again to\r\nthe Castle of Maidens making great dole for the hurt of Sir Tristram,\r\nand his sudden departing. So God me help, said King Arthur, I am more\r\nheavy that I cannot meet with him than for all the hurts that all my\r\nknights have had at the tournament. Right so came Sir Gaheris and told\r\nKing Arthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was\r\nat Sir Palomides\xe2\x80\x99 own request. Alas, said King Arthur, that was great\r\ndishonour to Sir Palomides, inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded,\r\nand now may we all, kings, and knights, and men of worship, say that\r\nSir Tristram may be called a noble knight, and one of the best knights\r\nthat ever I saw the days of my life. For I will that ye all, kings and\r\nknights, know, said King Arthur, that I never saw knight do so\r\nmarvellously as he hath done these three days; for he was the first\r\nthat began and that longest held on, save this last day. And though he\r\nwas hurt, it was a manly adventure of two noble knights, and when two\r\nnoble men encounter needs must the one have the worse, like as God will\r\nsuffer at that time. As for me, said Sir Launcelot, for all the lands\r\nthat ever my father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an I had\r\nknown him at that time; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield.\r\nFor an I had seen his black shield, I would not have meddled with him\r\nfor many causes; for late he did as much for me as ever did knight, and\r\nthat is well known that he had ado with thirty knights, and no help\r\nsave Sir Dinadan. And one thing shall I promise, said Sir Launcelot,\r\nSir Palomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow\r\nthat noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus. Sir Launcelot said all\r\nthe worship that might be said by Sir Tristram. Then King Arthur made a\r\ngreat feast to all that would come. And thus we let pass King Arthur,\r\nand a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides, that after he had a fall\r\nof Sir Tristram, he was nigh-hand araged out of his wit for despite of\r\nSir Tristram. And so he followed him by adventure. And as he came by a\r\nriver, in his woodness he would have made his horse to have leapt over;\r\nand the horse failed footing and fell in the river, wherefore Sir\r\nPalomides was adread lest he should have been drowned; and then he\r\navoided his horse, and swam to the land, and let his horse go down by\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was,\r\nand of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir\r\nTristram.\r\n\r\nAnd when he came to the land he took off his harness, and sat roaring\r\nand crying as a man out of his mind. Right so came a damosel even by\r\nSir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and his brother unto Sir\r\nMordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir\r\nTristram was. For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir\r\nMordred a ten days afore; and had it not been for the love of Sir\r\nGawaine and his brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred. And so\r\nthis damosel came by Sir Palomides, and she and he had language\r\ntogether, the which pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode\r\nher ways till she came to the old knight\xe2\x80\x99s place, and there she told\r\nthat old knight how she met with the woodest knight by adventure that\r\never she met withal. What bare he in his shield? said Sir Tristram. It\r\nwas indented with white and black, said the damosel. Ah, said Sir\r\nTristram, that was Sir Palomides, the good knight. For well I know him,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, for one of the best knights living in this realm.\r\nThen that old knight took a little hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides,\r\nand brought him unto his own manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir\r\nPalomides, but he said but little, for at that time Sir Tristram was\r\nwalking upon his feet, and well amended of his hurts; and always when\r\nSir Palomides saw Sir Tristram he would behold him full marvellously,\r\nand ever him seemed that he had seen him. Then would he say unto Sir\r\nDinadan: An ever I may meet with Sir Tristram he shall not escape mine\r\nhands. I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, that ye boast behind Sir Tristram,\r\nfor it is but late that he was in your hands, and ye in his hands; why\r\nwould ye not hold him when ye had him? for I saw myself twice or thrice\r\nthat ye gat but little worship of Sir Tristram. Then was Sir Palomides\r\nashamed. So leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old\r\nknight Sir Darras.\r\n\r\nNow shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot: Had not\r\nye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he was here daily unto the\r\ntime ye met with him, and in an evil time, said Arthur, ye encountered\r\nwith him. My lord Arthur, said Launcelot, ye put upon me that I should\r\nbe cause of his departition; God knoweth it was against my will. But\r\nwhen men be hot in deeds of arms oft they hurt their friends as well as\r\ntheir foes. And my lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall understand that\r\nSir Tristram is a man that I am loath to offend, for he hath done for\r\nme more than ever I did for him as yet. But then Sir Launcelot made\r\nbring forth a book: and then Sir Launcelot said: Here we are ten\r\nknights that will swear upon a book never to rest one night where we\r\nrest another this twelvemonth until that we find Sir Tristram. And as\r\nfor me, said Sir Launcelot, I promise you upon this book that an I may\r\nmeet with him, either with fairness or foulness I shall bring him to\r\nthis court, or else I shall die therefore. And the names of these ten\r\nknights that had undertaken this quest were these following: First was\r\nSir Launcelot, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Bleoberis,\r\nand Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Lucan the Butler, Sir Uwaine, Sir Galihud\r\nLionel, and Galiodin. So these ten noble knights departed from the\r\ncourt of King Arthur, and so they rode upon their quest together until\r\nthey came to a cross where departed four ways, and there departed the\r\nfellowship in four to seek Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nAnd as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he met with Dame Bragwaine that\r\nwas sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she fled as fast\r\nas her palfrey might go. So Sir Launcelot met with her and asked her\r\nwhy she fled. Ah, fair knight, said Dame Bragwaine, I flee for dread of\r\nmy life, for here followeth me Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9 to slay me. Hold\r\nyou nigh me, said Sir Launcelot. Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breuse\r\nSaunce Pit\xc3\xa9, Sir Launcelot cried unto him, and said: False knight,\r\ndestroyer of ladies and damosels, now thy last days be come. When Sir\r\nBreuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9 saw Sir Launcelot\xe2\x80\x99s shield he knew it well, for at\r\nthat time he bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he bare his own shield.\r\nAnd then Sir Breuse fled, and Sir Launcelot followed after him. But Sir\r\nBreuse was so well horsed that when him list to flee he might well\r\nflee, and also abide when him list. And then Sir Launcelot returned\r\nunto Dame Bragwaine, and she thanked him of his great labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan were\r\ntaken and put in prison.\r\n\r\nNow will we speak of Sir Lucan the butler, that by fortune he came\r\nriding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he came in\r\nnone other intent but to ask harbour. Then the porter asked what was\r\nhis name. Tell your lord that my name is Sir Lucan, the butler, a\r\nKnight of the Round Table. So the porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of\r\nthe place, and told him who was there to ask harbour. Nay, nay, said\r\nSir Daname, that was nephew to Sir Darras, say him that he shall not be\r\nlodged here, but let him wit that I, Sir Daname, will meet with him\r\nanon, and bid him make him ready. So Sir Daname came forth on\r\nhorseback, and there they met together with spears, and Sir Lucan smote\r\ndown Sir Daname over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s croup, and then he fled into that\r\nplace, and Sir Lucan rode after him, and asked after him many times.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram: It is shame to see the lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncousin of this place defoiled. Abide, said Sir Tristram, and I shall\r\nredress it. And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on horseback, and he\r\njousted with Lucan the butler, and there Sir Lucan smote Dinadan\r\nthrough the thick of the thigh, and so he rode his way; and Sir\r\nTristram was wroth that Sir Dinadan was hurt, and followed after, and\r\nthought to avenge him; and within a while he overtook Sir Lucan, and\r\nbade him turn; and so they met together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir\r\nLucan passing sore and gave him a fall. With that came Sir Uwaine, a\r\ngentle knight, and when he saw Sir Lucan so hurt he called Sir Tristram\r\nto joust with him. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name I\r\nrequire you. Sir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwaine le Fise de\r\nRoy Ureine. Ah, said Sir Tristram, by my will I would not have ado with\r\nyou at no time. Ye shall not so, said Sir Uwaine, but ye shall have ado\r\nwith me. And then Sir Tristram saw none other bote, but rode against\r\nhim, and overthrew Sir Uwaine and hurt him in the side, and so he\r\ndeparted unto his lodging again. And when Sir Dinadan understood that\r\nSir Tristram had hurt Sir Lucan he would have ridden after Sir Lucan\r\nfor to have slain him, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him. Then Sir\r\nUwaine let ordain an horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to the abbey\r\nof Ganis, and the castle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis, of the\r\nwhich Sir Bleoberis was lord. And at that castle Sir Launcelot promised\r\nall his fellows to meet in the quest of Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\nSo when Sir Tristram was come to his lodging there came a damosel that\r\ntold Sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that tournament,\r\nand two grievously wounded that they were never like to help themself.\r\nAnd all this was done by a noble knight that bare the black shield, and\r\nthat was he that bare the prize. Then came there one and told Sir\r\nDarras that the same knight was within, him that bare the black shield.\r\nThen Sir Darras yede unto Sir Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and there he found\r\nhis shield and showed it to the damosel. Ah sir, said the damosel, that\r\nsame is he that slew your three sons. Then without any tarrying Sir\r\nDarras put Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan, within a\r\nstrong prison, and there Sir Tristram was like to have died of great\r\nsickness; and every day Sir Palomides would reprove Sir Tristram of old\r\nhate betwixt them. And ever Sir Tristram spake fair and said little.\r\nBut when Sir Palomides saw the falling of sickness of Sir Tristram,\r\nthen was he heavy for him, and comforted him in all the best wise he\r\ncould. And as the French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir\r\nDarras that were of his own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram\r\nand his two fellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept\r\nthem in prison, and meat and drink they had. So Sir Tristram endured\r\nthere great pain, for sickness had undertaken him, and that is the\r\ngreatest pain a prisoner may have. For all the while a prisoner may\r\nhave his health of body he may endure under the mercy of God and in\r\nhope of good deliverance; but when sickness toucheth a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s body,\r\nthen may a prisoner say all wealth is him bereft, and then he hath\r\ncause to wail and to weep. Right so did Sir Tristram when sickness had\r\nundertaken him, for then he took such sorrow that he had almost slain\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII. How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of Sir\r\nTristram. Some of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights jousted with knights of\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nNow will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir\r\nDinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought after Sir\r\nTristram many divers parts of this land. And some yede into Cornwall;\r\nand by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King Arthur, came unto King\r\nMark, and there he was well received and sat at King Mark\xe2\x80\x99s own table\r\nand ate of his own mess. Then King Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings\r\nthere were in the realm of Logris. Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king\r\nreigneth as a noble knight; and now but late there was a great jousts\r\nand tournament as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most\r\nnoble knights were at that jousts. But there was one knight that did\r\nmarvellously three days, and he bare a black shield, and of all knights\r\nthat ever I saw he proved the best knight. Then, said King Mark, that\r\nwas Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim. Not so, said Sir\r\nGheris, for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides were on the contrary\r\nparty against the Knight with the Black Shield. Then was it Sir\r\nTristram, said the king. Yea, said Sir Gaheris. And therewithal the\r\nking smote down his head, and in his heart he feared sore that Sir\r\nTristram should get him such worship in the realm of Logris\r\nwherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him. Thus\r\nSir Gaheris had great cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La Beale\r\nIsoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris\xe2\x80\x99 words; for well she wist by\r\nhis deeds and manners that it was Sir Tristram. And then the king made\r\na feast royal, and to that feast came Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine,\r\nand some called him Uwaine le Blanchemains. And this Sir Uwaine\r\nchallenged all the knights of Cornwall. Then was the king wood wroth\r\nthat he had no knights to answer him. Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King\r\nMark, leapt up and said: I will encounter with Sir Uwaine. Then he yede\r\nand armed him and horsed him in the best manner. And there Sir Uwaine\r\nmet with Sir Andred, and smote him down that he swooned on the earth.\r\nThen was King Mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he had no knight\r\nto revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.\r\n\r\nSo the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him\r\nfor his sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwaine. Sir, said Sir\r\nDinas, I am full loath to have ado with any knight of the Round Table.\r\nYet, said the king, for my love take upon thee to joust. So Sir Dinas\r\nmade him ready, and anon they encountered together with great spears,\r\nbut Sir Dinas was overthrown, horse and man, a great fall. Who was\r\nwroth but King Mark! Alas, he said, have I no knight that will\r\nencounter with yonder knight? Sir, said Sir Gaheris, for your sake I\r\nwill joust. So Sir Gaheris made him ready, and when he was armed he\r\nrode into the field. And when Sir Uwaine saw Sir Gaheris\xe2\x80\x99 shield he\r\nrode to him and said: Sir, ye do not your part. For, sir, the first\r\ntime ye were made Knight of the Round Table ye sware that ye should not\r\nhave ado with your fellowship wittingly. And pardie, Sir Gaheris, ye\r\nknew me well enough by my shield, and so do I know you by your shield,\r\nand though ye would break your oath I would not break mine; for there\r\nis not one here, nor ye, that shall think I am afeard of you, but I\r\ndurst right well have ado with you, and yet we be sisters\xe2\x80\x99 sons. Then\r\nwas Sir Gaheris ashamed, and so therewithal every knight went their\r\nway, and Sir Uwaine rode into the country.\r\n\r\nThen King Mark armed him, and took his horse and his spear, with a\r\nsquire with him. And then he rode afore Sir Uwaine, and suddenly at a\r\ngap he ran upon him as he that was not ware of him, and there he smote\r\nhim almost through the body, and there left him. So within a while\r\nthere came Sir Kay and found Sir Uwaine, and asked him how he was hurt.\r\nI wot not, said Sir Uwaine, why nor wherefore, but by treason I am sure\r\nI gat this hurt; for here came a knight suddenly upon me or that I was\r\nware, and suddenly hurt me. Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King\r\nMark. Thou traitor knight, said Sir Kay, an I wist it were thou that\r\nthus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my\r\nhands. Sir, said Sir Andred, I did never hurt him, and that I will\r\nreport me to himself. Fie on you false knight, said Sir Kay, for ye of\r\nCornwall are nought worth. So Sir Kay made carry Sir Uwaine to the\r\nAbbey of the Black Cross, and there he was healed. And then Sir Gaheris\r\ntook his leave of King Mark, but or he departed he said: Sir king, ye\r\ndid a foul shame unto you and your court, when ye banished Sir Tristram\r\nout of this country, for ye needed not to have doubted no knight an he\r\nhad been here. And so he departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. Of the treason of King Mark, and how Sir Gaheris smote\r\nhim down and Andred his cousin.\r\n\r\nThen there came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, unto King Mark, and there he\r\nhad good cheer showing outward. Now, fair lords, said he, will ye prove\r\nany adventure in the forest of Morris, in the which I know well is as\r\nhard an adventure as I know any. Sir, said Sir Kay, I will prove it.\r\nAnd Sir Gaheris said he would be avised for King Mark was ever full of\r\ntreason: and therewithal Sir Gaheris departed and rode his way. And by\r\nthe same way that Sir Kay should ride he laid him down to rest,\r\ncharging his squire to wait upon Sir Kay; And warn me when he cometh.\r\nSo within a while Sir Kay came riding that way, and then Sir Gaheris\r\ntook his horse and met him, and said: Sir Kay, ye are not wise to ride\r\nat the request of King Mark, for he dealeth all with treason. Then said\r\nSir Kay: I require you let us prove this adventure. I shall not fail\r\nyou, said Sir Gaheris. And so they rode that time till a lake that was\r\nthat time called the Perilous Lake, and there they abode under the shaw\r\nof the wood.\r\n\r\nThe meanwhile King Mark within the castle of Tintagil avoided all his\r\nbarons, and all other save such as were privy with him were avoided out\r\nof his chamber. And then he let call his nephew Sir Andred, and bade\r\narm him and horse him lightly; and by that time it was midnight. And so\r\nKing Mark was armed in black, horse and all; and so at a privy postern\r\nthey two issued out with their varlets with them, and rode till they\r\ncame to that lake. Then Sir Kay espied them first, and gat his spear,\r\nand proffered to joust. And King Mark rode against him, and smote each\r\nother full hard, for the moon shone as the bright day. And there at\r\nthat jousts Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s horse fell down, for his horse was not so big as\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and Sir Kay\xe2\x80\x99s horse bruised him full sore. Then Sir\r\nGaheris was wroth that Sir Kay had a fall. Then he cried: Knight, sit\r\nthou fast in thy saddle, for I will revenge my fellow. Then King Mark\r\nwas afeard of Sir Gaheris, and so with evil will King Mark rode against\r\nhim, and Sir Gaheris gave him such a stroke that he fell down. So then\r\nforthwithal Sir Gaheris ran unto Sir Andred and smote him from his\r\nhorse quite, that his helm smote in the earth, and nigh had broken his\r\nneck. And therewithal Sir Gaheris alighted, and gat up Sir Kay. And\r\nthen they yode both on foot to them, and bade them yield them, and tell\r\ntheir names outher they should die. Then with great pain Sir Andred\r\nspake first, and said: It is King Mark of Cornwall, therefore be ye\r\nware what ye do, and I am Sir Andred, his cousin. Fie on you both, said\r\nSir Gaheris, for a false traitor, and false treason hast thou wrought\r\nand he both, under the feigned cheer that ye made us! it were pity,\r\nsaid Sir Gaheris, that thou shouldst live any longer. Save my life,\r\nsaid King Mark, and I will make amends; and consider that I am a king\r\nanointed. It were the more shame, said Sir Gaheris, to save thy life;\r\nthou art a king anointed with cream, and therefore thou shouldst hold\r\nwith all men of worship; and therefore thou art worthy to die. With\r\nthat he lashed at King Mark without saying any more, and covered him\r\nwith his shield and defended him as he might. And then Sir Kay lashed\r\nat Sir Andred, and therewithal King Mark yielded him unto Sir Gaheris.\r\nAnd then he kneeled adown, and made his oath upon the cross of the\r\nsword, that never while he lived he would be against errant-knights.\r\nAnd also he sware to be good friend unto Sir Tristram if ever he came\r\ninto Cornwall.\r\n\r\nBy then Sir Andred was on the earth, and Sir Kay would have slain him.\r\nLet be, said Sir Gaheris, slay him not I pray you. It were pity, said\r\nSir Kay, that he should live any longer, for this is nigh cousin unto\r\nSir Tristram, and ever he hath been a traitor unto him, and by him he\r\nwas exiled out of Cornwall, and therefore I will slay him, said Sir\r\nKay. Ye shall not, said Sir Gaheris; sithen I have given the king his\r\nlife, I pray you give him his life. And therewithal Sir Kay let him go.\r\nAnd so Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris rode their way unto Dinas, the\r\nSeneschal, for because they heard say that he loved well Sir Tristram.\r\nSo they reposed them there, and soon after they rode unto the realm of\r\nLogris. And so within a little while they met with Sir Launcelot that\r\nalways had Dame Bragwaine with him, to that intent he weened to have\r\nmet the sooner with Sir Tristram; and Sir Launcelot asked what tidings\r\nin Cornwall, and whether they heard of Sir Tristram or not. Sir Kay and\r\nSir Gaheris answered and said, that they heard not of him. Then they\r\ntold Sir Launcelot word by word of their adventure. Then Sir Launcelot\r\nsmiled and said: Hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in\r\nthe bone; and so made them merry together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. How after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir\r\nDinadan had been long in prison they were delivered.\r\n\r\nNow leave we off this tale, and speak we of Sir Dinas that had within\r\nthe castle a paramour, and she loved another knight better than him.\r\nAnd so when Sir Dinas went out a-hunting she slipped down by a towel,\r\nand took with her two brachets, and so she yede to the knight that she\r\nloved, and he her again. And when Sir Dinas came home and missed his\r\nparamour and his brachets, then was he the more wrother for his\r\nbrachets than for the lady. So then he rode after the knight that had\r\nhis paramour, and bade him turn and joust. So Sir Dinas smote him down,\r\nthat with the fall he brake his leg and his arm. And then his lady and\r\nparamour cried Sir Dinas mercy, and said she would love him better than\r\never she did. Nay, said Sir Dinas, I shall never trust them that once\r\nbetrayed me, and therefore, as ye have begun, so end, for I will never\r\nmeddle with you. And so Sir Dinas departed, and took his brachets with\r\nhim, and so rode to his castle.\r\n\r\nNow will we turn unto Sir Launcelot, that was right heavy that he could\r\nnever hear no tidings of Sir Tristram, for all this while he was in\r\nprison with Sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan. Then Dame Bragwaine\r\ntook her leave to go into Cornwall, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Kay, and Sir\r\nGaheris rode to seek Sir Tristram in the country of Surluse.\r\n\r\nNow speaketh this tale of Sir Tristram and of his two fellows, for\r\nevery day Sir Palomides brawled and said language against Sir Tristram.\r\nI marvel, said Sir Dinadan, of thee, Sir Palomides, an thou haddest Sir\r\nTristram here thou wouldst do him no harm; for an a wolf and a sheep\r\nwere together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in\r\npeace. And wit thou well, said Sir Dinadan, this same is Sir Tristram\r\nat a word, and now must thou do thy best with him, and let see now if\r\nye can skift it with your hands. Then was Sir Palomides abashed and\r\nsaid little. Sir Palomides, then said Sir Tristram, I have heard much\r\nof your maugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this\r\ntime by my will, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us in\r\ngovernance; for an I dread him not more than I do thee, soon it should\r\nbe skift: so they peaced themself. Right so came in a damosel and said:\r\nKnights, be of good cheer, for ye are sure of your lives, and that I\r\nheard say my lord, Sir Darras. Then were they glad all three, for daily\r\nthey weened they should have died.\r\n\r\nThen soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he weened to have\r\ndied; then Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides under them both\r\nmaking great sorrow. So a damosel came in to them and found them\r\nmourning. Then she went unto Sir Darras, and told him how that mighty\r\nknight that bare the black shield was likely to die. That shall not be,\r\nsaid Sir Darras, for God defend when knights come to me for succour\r\nthat I should suffer them to die within my prison. Therefore, said Sir\r\nDarras to the damosel, fetch that knight and his fellows afore me. And\r\nthen anon Sir Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him. He said: Sir\r\nknight, me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble\r\nknight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye well it shall never be\r\nsaid that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in\r\nprison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby I was\r\ngreatly aggrieved. But now shalt thou go and thy fellows, and your\r\nharness and horses have been fair and clean kept, and ye shall go where\r\nit liketh you, upon this covenant, that thou, knight, wilt promise me\r\nto be good friend to my sons two that be now alive, and also that thou\r\ntell me thy name. Sir, said he, as for me my name is Sir Tristram de\r\nLiones, and in Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark. And\r\nas for the death of your sons I might not do withal, for an they had\r\nbeen the next kin that I have I might have done none otherwise. And if\r\nI had slain them by treason or treachery I had been worthy to have\r\ndied. All this I consider, said Sir Darras, that all that ye did was by\r\nforce of knighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to\r\ndeath. But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you\r\nheartily to be my good friend and to my sons. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I\r\npromise you by the faith of my body, ever while I live I will do you\r\nservice, for ye have done to us but as a natural knight ought to do.\r\nThen Sir Tristram reposed him there till that he was amended of his\r\nsickness; and when he was big and strong they took their leave, and\r\nevery knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till\r\nthey came to a cross way. Now fellows, said Sir Tristram, here will we\r\ndepart in sundry ways. And because Sir Dinadan had the first adventure\r\nof him I will begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL. How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9,\r\nand how Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay.\r\n\r\nSo as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he found a lady making great dole.\r\nWhat aileth you? said Sir Dinadan. Sir knight, said the lady, I am the\r\nwofullest lady of the world, for within these five days here came a\r\nknight called Sir Breuse Saunce Pit\xc3\xa9, and he slew mine own brother, and\r\never since he hath kept me at his own will, and of all men in the world\r\nI hate him most; and therefore I require you of knighthood to avenge\r\nme, for he will not tarry, but be here anon. Let him come, said Sir\r\nDinadan, and because of honour of all women I will do my part. With\r\nthis came Sir Breuse, and when he saw a knight with his lady he was\r\nwood wroth. And then he said: Sir knight, keep thee from me. So they\r\nhurtled together as thunder, and either smote other passing sore, but\r\nSir Dinadan put him through the shoulder a grievous wound, and or ever\r\nSir Dinadan might turn him Sir Breuse was gone and fled. Then the lady\r\nprayed him to bring her to a castle there beside but four mile thence;\r\nand so Sir Dinadan brought her there, and she was welcome, for the lord\r\nof that castle was her uncle; and so Sir Dinadan rode his way upon his\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nNow turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he came to a\r\ncastle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay; and so when Sir\r\nTristram was let into that castle he had good cheer all that night. And\r\nupon the morn when he would have departed the queen said: Wit ye well\r\nye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner. Jesu\r\ndefend! said Sir Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner. Fair knight,\r\nsaid the queen, ye shall abide with me till that I wit what ye are and\r\nfrom whence ye come. And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her\r\nown side, and her paramour on the other side. And ever Queen Morgan\r\nwould behold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was\r\nin will suddenly to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he\r\nleft it for shame. Then the queen said to Sir Tristram: Tell me thy\r\nname, and I shall suffer you to depart when ye will. Upon that covenant\r\nI tell you my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Morgan le Fay,\r\nan I had wist that, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou\r\nshalt. But sithen I have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou\r\nwilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee,\r\nunto the castle of the Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a great\r\ntournament, and there I pray you that ye will be, and to do for me as\r\nmuch deeds of arms as ye may do. For at the Castle of Maidens, Sir\r\nTristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever I heard knight do.\r\nMadam, said Sir Tristram, let me see the shield that I shall bear. Then\r\nthe shield was brought forth, and the field was goldish, with a king\r\nand a queen therein painted, and a knight standing above them, [one\r\nfoot] upon the king\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the other upon the queen\xe2\x80\x99s. Madam, said\r\nSir Tristram, this is a fair shield and a mighty; but what signifieth\r\nthis king and this queen, and the knight standing upon both their\r\nheads? I shall tell you, said Morgan le Fay, it signifieth King Arthur\r\nand Queen Guenever, and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and\r\nin servage. Who is that knight? said Sir Tristram. That shall ye not\r\nwit as at this time, said the queen. But as the French book saith,\r\nQueen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and ever she desired him, and he\r\nwould never love her nor do nothing at her request, and therefore she\r\nheld many knights together for to have taken him by strength. And\r\nbecause she deemed that Sir Launcelot loved Queen Guenever paramour,\r\nand she him again, therefore Queen Morgan le Fay ordained that shield\r\nto put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent that King Arthur might\r\nunderstand the love between them. Then Sir Tristram took that shield\r\nand promised her to bear it at the tournament at the Castle of the Hard\r\nRock. But Sir Tristram knew not that that shield was ordained against\r\nSir Launcelot, but afterward he knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI. How Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how he\r\nslew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.\r\n\r\nSo then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the shield\r\nwith him. Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le Fay, his name\r\nwas Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow Sir Tristram. Fair\r\nfriend, said Morgan, ride not after that knight, for ye shall not win\r\nno worship of him. Fie on him, coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist\r\nnever good knight come out of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de\r\nLiones. What an that be he? said she. Nay, nay, said he, he is with La\r\nBeale Isoud, and this is but a daffish knight. Alas, my fair friend, ye\r\nshall find him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him\r\nbetter than ye do. For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay him.\r\nAh, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will follow that\r\nknight, for I fear me sore of your again coming. With this this knight\r\nrode his way wood wroth, and he rode after Sir Tristram as fast as he\r\nhad been chased with knights. When Sir Tristram heard a knight come\r\nafter him so fast he returned about, and saw a knight coming against\r\nhim. And when he came nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high: Sir\r\nknight, keep thee from me. Then they rushed together as it had been\r\nthunder, and Sir Hemison brised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his\r\nharness was so good that he might not hurt him. And Sir Tristram smote\r\nhim harder, and bare him through the body, and he fell over his horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncroup. Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more with his sword, but\r\nhe saw so much blood go from him that him seemed he was likely to die,\r\nand so he departed from him and came to a fair manor to an old knight,\r\nand there Sir Tristram lodged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII. How Morgan le Fay buried her paramour, and how Sir\r\nTristram praised Sir Launcelot and his kin.\r\n\r\nNow leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight that was\r\nwounded to the death. Then his varlet alighted, and took off his helm,\r\nand then he asked his lord whether there were any life in him. There is\r\nin me life, said the knight, but it is but little; and therefore leap\r\nthou up behind me when thou hast holpen me up, and hold me fast that I\r\nfall not, and bring me to Queen Morgan le Fay; for deep draughts of\r\ndeath draw to my heart that I may not live, for I would fain speak with\r\nher or I died: for else my soul will be in great peril an I die.\r\nFor[thwith] with great pain his varlet brought him to the castle, and\r\nthere Sir Hemison fell down dead. When Morgan le Fay saw him dead she\r\nmade great sorrow out of reason; and then she let despoil him unto his\r\nshirt, and so she let him put into a tomb. And about the tomb she let\r\nwrite: Here lieth Sir Hemison, slain by the hands of Sir Tristram de\r\nLiones.\r\n\r\nNow turn we unto Sir Tristram, that asked the knight his host if he saw\r\nlate any knights adventurous. Sir, he said, the last night here lodged\r\nwith me Ector de Maris and a damosel with him, and that damosel told me\r\nthat he was one of the best knights of the world. That is not so, said\r\nSir Tristram, for I know four better knights of his own blood, and the\r\nfirst is Sir Launcelot du Lake, call him the best knight, and Sir Bors\r\nde Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir Gaheris. Nay,\r\nsaid his host, Sir Gawaine is a better knight than he. That is not so,\r\nsaid Sir Tristram, for I have met with them both, and I felt Sir\r\nGaheris for the better knight, and Sir Lamorak I call him as good as\r\nany of them except Sir Launcelot. Why name ye not Sir Tristram? said\r\nhis host, for I account him as good as any of them. I know not Sir\r\nTristram, said Tristram. Thus they talked and bourded as long as them\r\nlist, and then went to rest. And on the morn Sir Tristram departed, and\r\ntook his leave of his host, and rode toward the Roche Dure, and none\r\nadventure had Sir Tristram but that; and so he rested not till he came\r\nto the castle, where he saw five hundred tents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that\r\nMorgan le Fay delivered to him.\r\n\r\nThen the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s knights, and there began a great medley. So came in Sir\r\nTristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there he smote down many\r\nknights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that shield. And when\r\nKing Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in what intent it was\r\nmade; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore she was heavy.\r\nThen was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur,\r\nand when she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake\r\nopenly unto King Arthur. Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained\r\nfor you, to warn you of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to\r\nyou and your queen. And then anon that damosel picked her away privily,\r\nthat no man wist where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and\r\nwroth, and asked from whence came that damosel. There was not one that\r\nknew her nor wist where she was become. Then Queen Guenever called to\r\nher Sir Ector de Maris, and there she made her complaint to him, and\r\nsaid: I wot well this shield was made by Morgan le Fay in despite of me\r\nand of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread me sore lest I should be\r\ndestroyed. And ever the king beheld Sir Tristram, that did so\r\nmarvellous deeds of arms that he wondered sore what knight he might be,\r\nand well he wist it was not Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir\r\nTristram was in Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he\r\ndeemed, an he had been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of\r\nhis fellows that were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should\r\nhave found him or that time. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he\r\nmight be. And ever Sir Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s eye was on that shield. All that espied\r\nthe queen, and that made her sore afeard.\r\n\r\nThen ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what upon\r\nthe right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might\r\nwithstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to\r\nwithdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight\r\nwith the strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him\r\nSir Uwaine le Blanche Mains, and bade him arm him and make him ready.\r\nSo anon King Arthur and Sir Uwaine dressed them before Sir Tristram,\r\nand required him to tell them where he had that shield. Sir, he said, I\r\nhad it of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King Arthur.\r\n\r\n So here endeth this history of this book, for it is the first book of\r\n Sir Tristram de Liones and the second book of Sir Tristram followeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\nAbashed, abased, lowered,\r\nAbate, depress, calm,\r\nAbought, paid for,\r\nAbraid, started,\r\nAccompted, counted,\r\nAccorded, agreed,\r\nAccordment, agreement,\r\nAcquit, repay,\r\nActually, actively,\r\nAdoubted, afraid,\r\nAdvision, vision,\r\nAfeard, afraid,\r\nAfterdeal, disadvantage,\r\nAgainsay, retract,\r\nAknown, known,\r\nAligement, alleviation,\r\nAllegeance, alleviation,\r\nAllow, approve,\r\nAlmeries, chests,\r\nAlther, gen. pl., of all,\r\nAmounted, mounted,\r\nAnealed, anointed,\r\nAnguishly, in pain,\r\nAnon, at once,\r\nApair, weaken,\r\nApparelled, fitted up,\r\nAppeach, impeach,\r\nAppealed, challenged, accused,\r\nAppertices, displays,\r\nAraged, enraged, ;
